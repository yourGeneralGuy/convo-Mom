277,Hey mom.
278,Life has been getting a bit hectic lately.
279,I find myself wondering if my job is going to last much longer.
280,"It seems that when I'm the only assistant in the office, I get all the work (as I should, I'm the only one there), but when I'm not the only assistant, I get none of the work."
281,"I ask if there is anything I could be doing, or if anyone needs help, but I'm told no."
282,"As it is a temporary assignment with a temp agency, should I stick it out till the end of my contract,  or should I call it quits and move on to another assignment?"
283,I'm so confused.
284,"I really like this job, but I find myself bored a lot and even though I try to look busy and often take typing tests,  or aimlessly click around when somknw walks by, it's proving to be a struggle because everyone would rather go to someone else than me."
285,"The cherry on top of it all is if I do leave this temp job, I don't know if I'll be able to collect on unemployment insurance while I wait to be selected for a new one."
286,"And I know if it happens that I decide to move on, Travis (boyfriend) will then be alone in paying bills, and he's already stressing out because of finances as it is."
287,"With me having no job, I think it might just break him, and I'm scared."
288,I don't know what to do mom.
289,I'm feeling stuck.
290,"I don't like having a job where I don't feel my skills are properly utilized, and where i feel as though Im being passed over, because im a temp employee, but i love what i do, when im actually doing it, and i knpw that keeping the job, as long as the contract is active, will help eliviate the financial burden that Travis is feeling."
291,"He's the bread winner of us two, and i just feel so terrible that hes been supporting me and our kid for years, while i struggle to find a permanent job and bounce from one temporary position to another, hoping that on of the company's will like me enough to keep me."
292,😔
293,"Hey mom, thanks for being stronger than us."
294,We know you're winging it when you're raising us and we appreciate everything you could do.
295,You deserve the world just like every mom does.
296,I recently lost my mom and miss her so much.

344,Ive always wondered what having a loving mother would be like that I could just talk to or have a real conversation about herself and myself.

346,Hi Mom!
347,Just writing to say I love you and Im looking forward to talking to you later.

349,"My mom passed away when I was 13, her birthday is also today."
350,"Never underestimate the true love a mother can give her child, and the power it provides."

373,"I was denied entry from the country I was living in and I'm trying to get back, but I'm not sure if my future is there anymore."
374,"I'm not sure if my future is with my boyfriend, who loves me but is older and also mentally ill."
375,"I'm not sure if I should move back to my home country, or find somewhere new."
376,Study or keep working with what I'm doing.
377,"I feel like I can't survive being alive and I have too many ""needs"" and I'm so lazy (like ordering food instead of cooking) and I can just barely keep it all together but balls keep falling down."
378,I wish I could talk to my family about these things.
379,I just don't know what to do.
380,I’m sorry for your loss.
381,"Around this time, I was 15 when my dad passed."
382,[removed]
383,Hi.
384,My mom’s…not the best.
385,She yells at me and hits me sometimes too.
386,She’s never proud of me.
387,It makes me feel horrible.
388,Some caring words would be nice.
389,"Hey mom, I'm actuay 21!"
390,"Soon to be 22 tho, and I feel like I'm wasting my bio parents' money in a way..."
391,"They already pay for my appartment, my uni studies and then on top of that, my French boyfriend's meds for ulcerative colitis that cost a shit ton since he doesn't have insurance yet (not a permanent resident yet)."
392,"I feel like I'm gonna ruin their retirement and their entire last part of their lives, it makes it hard for me to go on at times because of it, and the psy says that I shouldn't get a job yet to pile up on my stress but with a job, I could at least cover a part of some expenses with my salary since I don't have to spend on anything else..."
393,"I know everyone says that health is more important than money at this point but I don't want to ruin their comfort of life, and I hate myself for it, it feels like it would've been better if everything had gone differently, why am I like this, what am I gonna do"
394,"Your daughter is so beautiful, takes after you."
395,And you're so kind to want to share this light and warmth with others.
396,"Sometimes I wish I had a mom that cared about me more than they care about themselves being right, or first."
397,My mother won't message me for long periods of time as a passive aggressive way to show me she doesn't care and I need to be the first to message always.
398,"Also my eldest sibling manipulates her to feel badly towards me, because we are estranged."
399,"Basically, I wish I had a healthy relationship with my mom and she was someone I could turn to for comfort and support when I need it."
400,"She even made me feel shitty about my getting married to a wonderful person, saying that I think I am better than her and the family because I married well."
401,"I lost my mom when I was young, and I’m doing ok, I guess, but I could sometimes use a mom."
402,We all could.
403,You take care.
404,Hi mom.
405,"My boyfriend broke up with me, and so I’m now looking for a place to move."
406,It was an amicable split but I’m still feeling pretty heartbroken as we both still have feelings for one another.
407,"I’m feeling grateful to have had such a positive experience after my most recent ex (who was emotionally abusive), but I’m still feeling kind of like a failure for screwing this one up too."
408,I need a hug.
409,"Hi mom,
It took me a long time to get my act together."
410,"I'm working on my health, losing weight again, and I'm trying to get all A's this semester."
411,I hope I'm making you proud.
412,[deleted]
413,I finally started therapy and have an appointment to start medications.
414,"I finally feel like I’m healing and the only person I’d want to tell is my mom, but she wants nothing to do with me."
415,I'm sorry for your loss.
416,I do have a mum but you can never have too many right?
417,Sending hugs other mother
418,You're the best mom ever!!
419,💗

437,I miss my mom more than anything.
438,Some days it is a crippling pain in my chest that is unbearable.
439,I can’t ever imagine losing a child.
440,"Sending love to you today, mom."
441,<3
442,Hi mom!
443,I have been really happy lately.
444,Hi mom.
445,I’m feeling very overwhelmed today and about to cry while rocking my 2 year old.
446,I yelled at my toddlers today and feel like a pos for it.
447,Can I have a hug?
448,"Hi mom, I love you and I miss you."
449,Hi mommy.
450,I just want you to know she’ll always be your little girl.
451,Always.
452,❤️

454,"She was diagnosed with ALS, it took her pretty quickly."
455,I miss her ever day.
456,I know the pain you’re feeling it’s terrible to lose a loved one.
457,"Hey mom, its good to hear from you 😊"
458,"I'm supposed to be working right now but instead i'm reading these comments and also someone started cutting onions, I have a Mom and she's awesome, I seen her yesterday but this is making me miss her."
459,I'm sorry for your loss.
460,"Hey mom, I turned 21 and it's great!"
461,"I won't lie, I have been drinking a bit but I promise I'm being careful about it."
462,I even have been spending time with my friends and going out.
463,It's been fun.
464,I miss you and have been thinking about you while I've been doing school work too.
465,It would be nice to have a drink with you sometime but I've been busy looking for work.
466,I thought life would be more fun and parties at this age but you can't always be right.
467,I just wanted to thank you for preparing me get to this point and making sure I have all the things I need to get here.
468,"I love you mom, talk soon 💕"

470,Love you too mom
471,"Hi mom,

I never had a good relationship with my birth mother, we haven’t talked in almost 20 years."
472,"My stepmom is nice enough, but I’ve never felt like I truly had a mother."
473,I’m sitting here trying to think of something to say and I am just at a complete loss.
474,"No, but I'm here for you!"
475,Any time and day I'll be here ❤️
476,"We love you, Mom!"
477,Peace to you.
478,"As a mom, I am making space in my heart for you and your daughter today."
479,"As a daughter of a not-too-great-at-emotional-support mom, I can always use some encouragement if you're still looking to give."
480,Love to you ❤
481,My mom passed away november 2020.
482,The same day I was 20 weeks pregnant with my first baby and her first grandchild.
483,You can be a mom to me if you like.
484,I really miss mine.
485,Losing my mom and becoming one so close together really opened my eyes to how much I truly lost.
486,"I look at my daughter every night after she falls asleep on me and think about how I know mine looked at me the same way, with the same love and adoration, even if I dont remember it."
487,I wish I could fall asleep on her chest just one more time.
488,I hold my baby tighter because I know that our time together is so fleeting.
489,I just lost my beloved big brother.
490,He died unexpectedly from a heart condition.
491,He was my best friend in the whole world and I feel totally lost without him.
492,"There has never been a world for me without him in it, and I am just so so sad."
493,"My mom and I don’t have the best relationship, and I’m not sure how to comfort her in this horrible loss."
494,I'm sorry for your loss.
495,Your story touched me.
496,I hope all the responses you got eased your pain a little bit.
497,Sending you a big hug.
498,You are a good mom.
499,My mom was a trash human.
500,"Narcasstic, toxic, lazy, abusive; I can't think of one thing that woman did for my sister, our family or me, and the things she did was because she got something out of it."
501,"I see two big smiles and a happy, loving relationship between mother and daughter, I wish I had a nice picture smiling of a mother that actually loved us."
502,Not sure what you want to take of this or if it was something you wanted to hear but you gave me a mom for a minute with just a simple picture.
503,hi mom!
504,"i got dumped a month ago and some very nasty stuff follows

never really recovered since, it has been running around in my head"
505,You both look so happy in that picture!
506,You can just tell she was loved and she loved you back.
507,"Sorry for your loss, that hole in the heart never fills, but the memories help to make it feel less empty."
508,"Lost my mom 7 years ago, and during covid when I've been on my own so much, I've never missed those mom hugs more."
509,"Hope your able to do something special for her bday, even if stuck at home."
510,I'll have a beer in honor of her 21st later!
511,"i'm so sorry for your loss, mom."
512,sis looks like she was absolutely wonderful!
513,Hi mum.
514,"My partner left me and it was really unexpected, for me at least."
515,I'd set up our whole life together.
516,Moved over 500 miles for him twice.
517,Finally found us a flat and he dropped me because I was too emotional one time.
518,He said he's scared of me.
519,Now I'm all alone in a new place with no one to love me and nowhere to go.
520,Idk what to do.
521,If ever I needed a mum it's now.
522,Sorry to be a pain.
523,"Love, Ebs."
524,"Hi there, I’m so sorry to hear about the loss of your beautiful daughter."
525,I was nine when my mom died and I miss being a daughter to her!
526,It's my bio mom's birthday today and it's just been another painful reminder of the fact that I can't have her in my life.
527,My parents were emotionally abusive and I was kicked out at 17.
528,It's been so difficult to face adulthood on my own but I'm going to be 23 in April and I'm so proud of the person who I have become on my own.
529,Thank you for being the kind of mom that you are supposed to be!
530,"❤️ Caring, accepting, and loving.."
531,Mom it's been such a hard day..
532,I had nightmares last night and on the way to work we hit a deer..
533,"I think the deer is okay, it's just the accident threw me into such a bad panic attack afterwards.."
534,"Mom, can I please have a hug?"
535,🥺❤️
536,The picture of you and your daughter is beautiful.
537,I would love to have a mom but I’m too old for you to be mine.
538,Sending you positive vibes and lots of love.
539,It’s my son’s 21st today.
540,I’ll hug him extra tight.
541,Can I have a mom for longer than a minute please?
542,"🥺

My mom was a psychotic abusive Narcissist, and I don’t talk to her anymore, because I value my mental and physical health."
543,But sometimes I just… want a mom.
544,To talk to about life.
545,Hey mom!
546,I finally turned my life around after a 20s of debauchery!
547,Ill be starting my physician assistant program in august and Im so psyched!
548,Love you mom!
549,"In March of 2020 my mom committed suicide, I’ve felt lost and alone since then."
550,You daughter is beautiful!
551,"❤️ My mom left when I was a year and a half, so I could definitely use some ”mom” in my life."
552,"If you want a 40yo daughter, that is?!"
553,"(Yes, I made my bed this morning) lol"
554,I'm so very sorry for your loss
555,I'm so sorry.
556,I just lost my brother at only 42.
557,I always need a mom hug.
558,I need a mom.
559,"Just earlier today actually, I was crying because it hit me that no matter how much I want to, I can never have a normal relationship with my own mother because she just refuses to work with me to build it."
560,"Dunno, it just feels kinda empty/lonely that I don't actually have a proper mom while everyone else does."
561,I'm around the same age as how old your daughter would be if she were alive.
562,"But I bet even though she's physically not around, her memories are still alive in your mind and heart 💖"
563,"I'm sorry for your loss, you're a great mom <3"
564,Aww mama ❤
565,"Hi Mom, i miss my friend who ghosted me and i don't understand why she did it."
566,"Thabks for always being there for me mom, even when you are going through tough times x"
567,Love you mom!
568,You’re the best ❤️
569,"I feel like I've never had an actual mother (hence why I'm here) soooo yeah, I'll take some mom energy."
570,"Trying to get my life and academic goals back on track with no support network and idk maybe you can scold me to do my homework, lol."
571,"Or idk, just give me some reassurance that it's worth all the struggle."
572,"Hey Mom, I know I'm going to be 36 in a few weeks, but I've got myself in a bad spot."
573,Living with someone I'm not in love with anymore (but still love...
574,Does that make sense?).
575,"We have two kittens we just rescued and I have no money or no place to go, so I just have to deal with the anger for now."
576,"I wish I would have listened, made some better decisions."
577,I hope you're doing okay today.
578,[deleted]

583,"From a daughter to a mother, you’re so amazing and I hope you’re doing okay."

604,A big hug and lots of love.
605,Stay strong mum.
606,I'm 37 and have a lovely mum and to be mother in law but there's always room for another great mum.
607,"Ps, I got 2 sisters both who'd have another mum in the collection."
608,"Can you tell me, how much plateware and cutlery should I have and do you want some rhubarb sending when it's ready?"

640,"But I just wanna say, you're a really fantastic mom for loving your daughter so much."
641,It comes through loud and clear.
642,Incredibly sorry for your loss.
643,"I'm old, my mom passed a few years ago."
644,What you represent my dear is the single most important commodity I can imagine having one last fleeting moment with again.
645,"I don't need a mama, but I do have a little girl up there."
646,"Much younger, only five, but I'm sure she's helping yours have a wonderful birthday."
647,"And I know you know, they love us from wherever they are now."
648,"I don't know that I believe in heaven, but I believe in our kiddos."

665,And we both had gps's.
666,You'd have laughed... we have a new road rule now.
667,"No matter what the GPS says...the road has to be Paved, and Not lead into a graveyard!"
668,I still love you.
669,I could use a hug mom life’s hard with the diabetes and constantly working sometimes I get in these ruts where I’m sad and I could use a mom like you but it’s hard not having my mom.
670,I could use a mom for a minute.
671,I would like a mum so i had someone to tell that i love them.
672,my mum was everything to me as a child and she passed when i was ten.
673,so if you need a enby offspring to tell you they love you and miss  you i'm your person.

689,So sorry for your loss 😢
690,"I’m so sorry for your loss, OP *hugs*❤️"
691,"Hi mom, I haven't talked to my bio mom for 3 years now, and she has made no effort to reach out other than a snippy ""sorry I'm not perfect"" message and the very occsional missed call."
692,I don't think she misses me at all.
693,Love you mom.
694,"You know you’re starting to heal when you think of her, and a smile comes across your face before a tear does."
695,Sending so much love your way.
696,Try and keep your head up.
697,I really do need a mom for a minute :(.
698,My mom died seven years ago.

700,Sorry you lost your girl.
701,I'll hug my sweet boy extra strong for you.
702,Love you mom!
703,Struggling to get off the couch and get to work.
704,I have to work on a fellowship application but I'm so depressed.
705,I don't have a good relationship with my mom and can't rely on her for emotional support.
706,"Hey Mum, Hope your doing something nice for yourself."
707,Your the best and deserve to treat yourself often.
708,Keep smiling.
709,Your the strongest woman I know.
710,I'm so sorry I'm 22 and lost my dad last summer.
711,He was across the country and we hadn't spoken in a month or seen one another in 6.
712,I can't help but wish I could have just one more conversation.
713,There are so many things I wish I could ask him that i thought I'd be able to one day when I was older and braver and less driven to just stay quiet and be a good daughter and not speak my mind so I wouldn't make him mad and lose him.
714,"I try not to think about what happened or why he did what he did too much, but I'm terrified ill hear the cops knocking on my door telling me that someone else I love was found deceased."
715,It's a terrible terrible thing to lose someone too soon.
716,I too call my mom mother when I'm mad and call her mom most of the time.
717,She's my best friend in the entire world and I can't imagine losing her.
718,Again I'm so sorry for your loss.
719,Beauties🤍
720,"I never really had a mom (she had very bad schizophrenia) any way if I may have a moment of you time, can you please just say something you wish you could say to her?"
721,I am sorry for your loss and all of my love.
722,"I’m a mom who needs a mom 🙂 tell me about her, what did her laugh sound like?"
723,What made her smile?
724,What did she do that drove you mad?
725,Me
726,"Hey, mom!"
727,You'll always be a mom to her.
728,Thank you for sharing your love and kindness with us too.
729,Have you been over to r/griefsupport?
730,I've found that cohort to be really helpful.
731,My mom passed when I was 13.
732,"Every day, something reminds me of her."
733,A three musketeers bar.
734,A dream catcher.
735,"Honey smacks, her favorite cereal."
736,I hope you had lots of good memories with her.
737,"Hey Mom, I'm going through a lot of stressful things in my life but I'm interviewing for the JET Program on Thursday so maybe later this year I'll be helping Japanese kids learn English."
738,(You and your daughter are beautiful.
739,But you can tell from that photo that she knew she was loved.)
740,"Hi, Mom."
741,Miss you.
742,You look so different today.
743,Don’t be sad.
744,I know it’s hard right now but things won’t be hard for always.
745,Just for right now.
746,We’ll get through ok?
747,We need you.
748,Beautiful pic of the 2 of you.
749,She clearly loved having you as her mom.
750,My condolences 🙏.
751,Pretty mom pretty daughter.
752,[deleted]
753,A most beautiful child.

759,Hey mom!
760,The 3rd apartment is pretty cool.
761,Haven't settled in yet.
762,2nd floor and I like the views out the back because it has a downhill slope and clearing.
763,Thanks!
764,Love you!
765,I'm extremely sorry for your loss.

798,"It's a ton less commitment than having a kid or adopting obviously, but (again sorry if I'm just wrong) I know it's something very difficult to get through and you can turn what happened to you and transform it into something positive by being someone else's maternal figure."

930,"There was something so special about seeing you there and feeling your pure, unhindered support."

934,"You've always told me to let myself feel sad, but when it's ready to pass, let it pass."

976,"When I was 15 a bunch of things happened that flipped my life upside down and I was seriously considering uhm… taking my ticket out of this world, so to speak."
977,"I opted out of it due to fear, and there are some days where I feel as though it would be easier if everything stopped."
978,"Seeing people share their stories (including you, mom) really puts things into perspective for me."
979,"I want you to know your daughter probably really loves you, just like I love my own mom."
980,And there isn’t a single universe where death can erase that kind of love.
981,"Love ya, mom."
982,Hi mom!

1041,"I've changed a bit since we last got to talk, new career path, bodies getting a bit worse and I fell in love with someone I can't pursue again, it's a struggle not being able to talk to you when I want."
1042,I know I haven't always been the easiest child to talk to but we had our own ways of showing our love and respect for eachother.
1043,"I know your life was full of loss and trials, how did you find yourself moving on from the situations you couldn't control?"
1044,How did you become a pillar of maturity while still learning to be an adult yourself?
1045,"I'm 32 now, your youngest is halfway ready to have her first, life is moving fast."
1046,How can I live up to the expectations you had?

1114,"It's been just over a year, but it feels like centuries since you went to be with God."
1115,I have been trying really hard to be strong and to take care of myself.
1116,You raised me to be a strong and intelligent woman.
1117,"But it's been so hard, and I just wish you could be here."
1118,I missed when I was so sick and you offered to come visit me just to give me a hug and make me my favorite food.
1119,"I remember when I would cry to you because I would be so stressed in school, and you would remind me just how proud you were of me."
1120,I am struggling to keep afloat.

1122,I wish you could've made me food and eat our favorite cake on my 21st birthday.

1152,"And you never stopped loving me, accepting me or supporting me."
1153,You would always try to help expand my horizons.
1154,"You hit the ground running, researching when I was diagnosed with Aspergers, you were my rock, my social guide and you protected me in situations where I felt unsafe...even when I became taller than you."
1155,Thanks to you I became a very functional independent person who can communicate my thoughts and emotions and navigate social situations.
1156,You were scared I would never but we did it.
1157,We succeeded.
1158,I’ll always love you.
1159,Sending you a massive hug.
1160,This photo is beautiful and you both look so happy in it.
1161,"Hey mom, how was your day today?"
1162,Both of you are absolutely gorgeous <3 She looks like she knew you loved her.
1163,I bet you were a great mom to her.
1164,"Mine isn't, seeing your picture reminded me of the kind of love I've always wanted from my own mother."
1165,"I'll need a mom for a minute again someday, and when I do, I really hope it's you or someone like you <3 Please stay strong, I know that's what she would've wanted."
1166,"Love you mom, miss you so much x wish I was with you"
1167,😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
1168,Im so so sorry she passed I hope you’re doing ok
1169,I'm sorry to hear about your loss
1170,"I'm so sorry about the loss of your daughter, I can't begin to understand the pain you've had to carry."
1171,"But 15 is the year I realized that I'm a trans guy, and the year my relationship with my mother changed forever, 11 years ago now."
1172,"If I may, I'd like to give to you some of the love that I've been holding on to and wishing I could give to a mom:

."
1173,"Hi, mom!"
1174,"I know I haven't reached out in a few weeks, but you know how I am."
1175,The world turns fast and I get caught up in it.
1176,I just wanted to say that I love you.
1177,"I'm really grateful that you're my mom, and I count myself lucky for the time we've had."
1178,It wasn't perfect—neither of us are perfect people—but you've done a really great job.
1179,"You always believed me when I was figuring myself out, and accepted me without question."
1180,That love and trust is the main reason why I'm so confident today.
1181,That's why I feel the freedom to try anything in front of me.
1182,"You believe in my ability to fly, but I know if I end up falling you'll be right there by my side when I hit the ground, offering me a hand up and a hug."
1183,"Even if you didn't approve, even if we fought, you never talked down to me."
1184,You've always been safe.
1185,"As hard as you tried to be there for me, I had to do my own thing for a bit."
1186,"Those were some hard years, and lonely ones, and I know you were hurting for me that whole time."
1187,I'm sorry you had to worry.
1188,"The day I realized I could call you, cry, and come home?"
1189,That was the first good day I'd had in a long time.
1190,I wouldn't ask for any other mom.
1191,"I know you overcame a lot to be the best mom you could be, and I'm so proud to be your kid."
1192,"When I'm a parent, I hope I can live up to your example."
1193,Thanks for being the greatest.

1290,"My mom passed away when I was 13 and I could use some motherly tips about being an adult, if you could share one or two :,)"
1291,Hey mom.
1292,I may have schizophrenia and I’m scared.
1293,My psychiatrist hasn’t called me back yet and it’s been a week.
1294,My mom doesn’t believe me and my dad says it can’t be true because people who have it are “violent”.
1295,I hope you are doing well
1296,"My irl mom is not v supportive, and my mom friend is busy so yeah.."
1297,"I need someone to hug me and say ""You are valid, you are loved, you do not have to mask yourself, you are perfect the way you are."""

1307,"Hey mom, can we talk?"
1308,I’m kind of running low on motivation to get out of bed today.
1309,Things have been stressful mentally and I’m feeling really overwhelmed and upset.
1310,"I’m stressing out about finding a set career in life, finances are so insanely stressful."

Love always, 
Your 20 year old daughter Weezy :)"

1313,I love you 💓✨
1314,"As someone who lost a daughter as well, I’m sending hugs and love your way."
1315,❤️
1316,This sub has been extraordinary to me and I could never repay the kindness and compassion that the people of this sub show.
1317,Can you tell me more about your daughter?
1318,What was she like as a person?
1319,What was her passion?
1320,What did she like to do?
1321,What was her favorite food?
1322,What was her favorite music artist?
1323,"Any awesome memories you want to share, please do!!"
1324,I wanna hear them!!!
1325,Giving you a huge hug today Mom!!!
1326,🤗♥️💞💓💕💝🥰
1327,I’m really sorry for your loss.
1328,*hugs and kisses* 🥺💜
1329,💐🥰🙏😇
1330,"Hello, I am thinking about starting to smoke cigarettes."
1331,All the cool kids are smoking them and I also want to be cool.
1332,"Would you, as a mother, approve of me smoking cigarettes to be cool?"
1333,My mom died in 2015.
1334,I will gladly be your daughter whenever you want to be a mom.
1335,I miss having a mom every day.
1336,The whole world is different.
1337,I’m sorry about your daughter 🥺.
1338,I’m waiting on results from a pet scan to ensure the cancer I’ve had to beat twice is gone.
1339,I’m terrified it might be back even though I have no lumps or symptoms but if it’s clear I’ll have been cancer free for a whole year
1340,Another mom here.
1341,I’m so sorry.
1342,She is beautiful.
1343,I do.
1344,My sister passed away at 29.
1345,"I can understand sibling loss, but my heart hurts for my loving mother who lost her firstborn daughter."
1346,My big sister would be 31 this year.
1347,My heart goes out to you.
1348,Does talking about her help?
1349,I always wonder if talking about my sister helps or hurts my mom.
1350,She’s a quiet person so as an extroverted autistic it can be sometimes hard to understand quiet people.
1351,I hope you are doing okay.
1352,You seem like a kind person.
1353,I'm crying reading the messages.
1354,I love you mom.
1355,I could use a mom.
1356,"I’m in university now, but when I was 15, school guidance counsellors told me I was too stupid for uni, and my mother never stood up for me."
1357,What sucks is she tells me she’s proud of me now and insists that I was the one who didn’t want to go to school.
1358,"I could use some genuine, clear headed pride in what I’ve done for myself so far."
1359,Thanks!
1360,I love you mom!!!!
1361,You were and are all a daughter could ever ask.
1362,"Hi mom, my mum is on the other side of the world and I really miss her."
1363,I just miss hugs.
1364,School is going okay I guess.
1365,I just kind of feel lost and not sure I can do this.
1366,I just keep hearing in my head that there is a 50% pass rate for this degree and I don’t know if I can do it.
1367,I’m way to stubborn to quit but I keep expecting them to kick me out any day now because they figure out I’m not the right person for this project.
1368,"My friend C, back home in CA, lost her mum this past weekend and her dad isn’t doing well since it happened."
1369,Ended up in the hospital and now they are saying he has lost the “will to thrive” or something like that.
1370,I don’t know how to help her or be there for her from so far away.
1371,I just wish I could fly there to hug her and cook her a proper meal and make her sit down for longer than 10 minutes and just eat.
1372,I’m stressed and so anxious about school I think it’s giving me acid reflux.
1373,"Scared of running out of my stash of Tums… I ran out of melatonin today and learned that I have to get a prescription for it here, which is weirdly complicated."
1374,I would have packed more of it last time I visited if I had known that!
1375,It’s nice seeing all of the virtual hugs and advice.
1376,You are an amazing mom for all of us and I hope you know that you are very loved.
1377,I love rose gold!
1378,💙💙
1379,"My mom told me when I was 15 that she wished I had gotten hit by a car on the way home so she wouldn't have to look at me (because I was failing my class)

Now I'm a dental assistant student and she can't be bothered to hear how well I'm doing"
1380,I miss you too mom.
1381,Coming from a girl who had to take a break from my mom.
1382,No need to go further into the sub since this is about a good mom missing her beautiful girl.
1383,I miss you too.
1384,Hugs
1385,My mother has helped me out a lot today.
1386,"She's been understanding, caring, and so helpful but I've had such a difficult time today."
1387,Just getting out of bed was ridiculously hard.
1388,The only thing that finally got me out of bed was that I knew I would get to see my girlfriend today.
1389,I got up and I did everything I needed to.
1390,When she was available she canceled on me and it just broke my heart that she didn't even want to talk on the phone.
1391,Maybe that's my fault for relying on her like that but I just couldn't stop crying.
1392,I was so angry at myself I put a dent in my driver seat's door.
1393,My mother noticed when I came back inside and stopped everything to help me.
1394,Gave me solutions and tasks to distract me.
1395,It really helped but I'm back in my hole now....
1396,I don't know.... Maybe I just needed to get that off my chest.
1397,Either way your daughter is beautiful and I'm sure you would be just as loving.
1398,I'm sorry...
1399,My 2 girls will when I kill myself in two months when I can't find a job to keep the house
1400,"Hey mom, I can’t imagine what you’re going through."
1401,I hope you know you are loved
1402,"I could use a mom, but I’m also a mom so I want to mom you for a moment and just give you a massive hug over the Internet and tell you how proud I am of you, how strong you are, and that we’re all here for you."
1403,My mom passed unexpectedly when I was 17 and I’m going to be 27 this month.
1404,I could definitely use a mom for a minute.
1405,Moooom I want pasta make me food!
1406,Lost my Mom when I was 20.
1407,I'm 32.
1408,It still hurts.
1409,Can u borrow you for a minute?
1410,Sorry for your loss.
1411,❤
1412,I’m a motherless daughter that is about to graduate nursing school and I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed.
1413,I could so use a mom hug right now…
1414,Your daughter had such a genuine smile here.
1415,"I can tell it's not a fake one people do for photos, but rather a genuine smile of happiness to be spending time with her mum and have it immortalised in a picture."
1416,"I personally feel that it is our job as people on this Earth to simply make other people feel happy, loved and comfortable, and I know for a fact that you managed that."
1417,You should be proud.
1418,:)
1419,"My mom was never there, I'll gladly be your daughter 🥺 I'm so sorry for your loss, she was such a beautiful girl."
1420,Sending all my love 💖
1421,Me
1422,mom is kinda hot
1423,I don't know how to edit a post and I tried so hard to respond to each kiddo that needed some love.
1424,There are just so many that I can't keep up.
1425,"Please know you all deserve love, happiness, respect and kindness."
1426,Thank you for making this mom feel needed again.
1427,Love to you all.
1428,I'm glad :)
1429,Hi can i be your mom
1430,🫂
1431,It’s my birthday this weekend and I’d love a mom for a min!
1432,Hi Ma
1433,Don’t believe everything you see
1434,"Hi mom, it’s mom."
1435,"My daughter passed away on the 13th of January, 1993."
1436,She would be 30 now.
1437,My mom passed away in 2015.
1438,I could use a good mom hug.
1439,I’m having a rough day.
1440,I think I just lost my best (only) friend and I’m so sad.
1441,"She usually helps me through this time in January when it’s the anniversary, but this year I’m doing it without her and it’s so much harder."
1442,Hugs?
1443,Thank you
1444,"Here to also say this, I'm so proud of how strong you've been and still are, love you mom xxx"

1448,OP.
1449,I'm so sorry for your loss and grief.
1450,You are not alone Mom.
1451,You will see them again!
1452,Thank you.
1453,"Yes, sorry about your daughter, but please take this as a compliment, I took a good 15 seconds to decide who is the mother and who is the daughter."
1454,Leaving the house can be the worst sometimes.
1455,Sensory overload is real and I hope everything goes super quickly for you so you can climb back into bed.
1456,"Hey, how did it go?"
1457,"As another mom, thinking about you."
1458,Thank you for the kind words.
1459,She was amazing!
1460,"Funny, kind, kind of a jerk and a huge smart ass!"
1461,I miss absolutely everything about her.
1462,Her laugh was contagious and obnoxious at the same time.
1463,She called me mama when she wasn't feeling good and mother when she was mad at me.
1464,I wish I could give her one more hug.
1465,I could use a hug!
1466,We would take Shrek baths!
1467,"Dig a whole in the front yard, fill it with water and take a mud bath."
1468,I have so many fond memories and pictures of us muddied up!
1469,Thank you 💙
1470,"Thank you, she was a pretty awesome kid."
1471,Sure!

1477,"I'm sorry, I understand how that feels"
1478,My family and I have a fundraiser each year and donate to local non-profits and charities.
1479,We had to postpone this year because myself and my parents have Covid.
1480,I did not know that first part at all.
1481,Completely unrelated but you have given me so much healing I didn’t know was possible.
1482,I used to play with my daughters hair all the time.
1483,Virtual hair play in action.
1484,(Sounds kinda funny typed out lol).
1485,I'm sorry things are rough right now.
1486,Take some time for self care if you can.
1487,Even if it's just sitting in the car listening to music for awhile.
1488,I hope she did also.
1489,Please be kind to yourself and don't feel selfish.
1490,I remember when I learned about the term parentification!
1491,I was shooked but it felt really good to know that there's a term that sums up a lot of my trauma and that Im not alone with it.
1492,"Obviously it sucks that other people have to deal with it as well, but at least we can all help each other out."
1493,"I love you, please take care of yourself!"
1494,You're going to do great!
1495,Im sure your mom is so proud of you and so am I!
1496,Bringing a new life into this world is scary but you got this!
1497,Keep us posted!
1498,I’m so excited for you
1499,"I found this post in June, how did everything go?"

1502,I wish you knew that I am right here with you!!!!
1503,I laugh when you laugh.
1504,I cry when you cry.
1505,"Together, I watch the sunset with you."
1506,I am the warmth of the morning sun.
1507,And the wind blowing away your pain.
1508,I love you so much that I will never leave you.
1509,I’m here just in a different way.
1510,You can hear my voice within.
1511,Just ask yourself what would I say?
1512,And sometimes I won’t have the answers & you might not hear my voice.
1513,And sometimes we will sit in silence & sit in pain.
1514,And it will be okay.
1515,I promise it will all be ok.
1516,Enjoy being a mama.
1517,The time passes quickly!
1518,And give that boy a big squeeze & sing & dance to that silly song I used to sing to you.
1519,xoxox
1520,Hugs to you and you're doing amazing!
1521,Life gets in the way sometimes but you'll find your way.
1522,Thank you.
1523,We used to have glow stick parties too.
1524,"I was telling another person that commented about how we would dig a hole in the front yard, fill it with water and take Shrek baths."
1525,How was your day?
1526,Oh no!
1527,I hope that you get your chance for the program!
1528,Is there another one available down the road?
1529,You'll find something better for you soon!
1530,Toxic work environments are the worst for ones well being.
1531,I'm glad you could tell me about it.
1532,I hope your bio mom doesn't freak out too much.
1533,Hugs
1534,"You are loved too , I want you to know that !!"
1535,Your daughter has always and will always love you
1536,Giving you a mom hug right now.
1537,For as long as needed.
1538,Oh man that was 20 years ago!
1539,I just remember watching her try to go and she looked at me all sassy and asked what I was looking what!
1540,Haha
1541,I'm sorry you're struggling right now.
1542,I hope that everything gets better for you soon!
1543,Big fat hug to you!
1544,My thoughts go out to you.
1545,Working in an environment that is anxiety inducing is horrible.
1546,Is there not an HR dept to reach out to about the accommodations they need to make?
1547,Please be kind to yourself.

1991,"I’m sorry that there is so little comfort any words I can give to make you feel the love I, and so many want to give to you."
1992,Thank you for sharing this precious experience with us so we can connect better with the people in our lives!
1993,It’s so important to be able to express feelings we all have.
1994,I love you!
1995,I can't even tell which one is the daughter.
1996,😉
1997,I thought it was a pic of the daughter and a friend or something.
1998,"Highly relatable, it took me a long time too."
1999,I think if she could your daughter would want to tell you that she loves you.
2000,I hope you can find some moments today where the joy she brought comes to life in your memories.
2001,"And if you have a minute, mom, I really need to tell someone tonight that I’m worried about money."
2002,I need to deal with it but it was one those things that I needed to accept before I could deal with it.
2003,I feel lighter and like I could sleep a lot easier to my have been able to tell a mom tonight.
2004,My mum (I’m British but I consider “mom” to be the canonically correct spelling for all other uses in this sub) had a bad day and I wanted to stick to telling her the good news for tonight.
2005,"I’m grateful for the weight off of me, mom."
2006,And I am still deciding…
2007,I am still not 100% if I am honest!
2008,Thank you!
2009,❤️
2010,It wasn't as bad as I feared.
2011,"Everyone was very nice, and the scan didn't take long at all."
2012,Thank you for thinking of me ❤️
2013,"You are so welcome 💞 I know it isn't the same, but I lost my parents."
2014,"It took about a decade after the loss for the anniversary, their birthdays not to hit me like a truck full of bricks."
2015,Remember that your grief is totally valid.
2016,"It will never be ok, but it does get easier."
2017,Thoughts to you 💫

2022,Sounds like she was pretty smart and full of personality!
2023,Thank you for sharing mama
2024,Now I’m crying in the parking lot at work.
2025,Wishing you all the best.
2026,So sorry for your loss.
2027,This made me tear up.
2028,"Lots of love to you, mom."
2029,❤️
2030,"She sounds a lot like me, smart ass with a heart of gold- I lost my mom about 6 years ago when I was 29."
2031,She is absolutely beautiful.
2032,So sorry for your loss.
2033,"She was the absolute best, wasn't she?"
2034,"I can see from her picture that she was beautiful, full of mischief and humor and fireworks and love."
2035,"I'm so sorry she's gone, and I'm so sorry that you have had to endure that loss."
2036,"Thank you, so much, for sharing your precious girl with us."
2037,I’m so sorry for ur loss
2038,Me me!
2039,Tell me more about sis too :)
2040,You’re a beautiful person mama.
2041,Make sure to live a life so fulfilling sis will feel she lived it too when you see her again.
2042,You’ll be able to tell her all about it with a smile and hold her in your arms.
2043,"It’s okay to miss her, to cry every now and then but always get back up!"
2044,"Live a life you and her are proud of, filled with happiness and kindness."
2045,She sounds like me lol.
2046,That’s what I’d call my mom too!
2047,I had another dream about mine about 5 days ago.
2048,I have hyper realistic dreams that she “drops by” and I always have this feeling to hold on because I know something isn’t right.
2049,"I always cuddle and call her mama, and then wake up and realize she’s gone."
2050,"It’s been 13 years now, but those dreams never stop."
2051,I have grown to love them.
2052,"Hoping you’ve found peace, and if you have those dreams they comfort you too."
2053,Hug!
2054,H U G S
2055,Doing this with my 6 year old when the weather warms up!
2056,!
2057,"That’s really cute, thank you for sharing"
2058,Thank you for sharing such a joyous memory with us.
2059,I have to assume these Shrek baths involved a heck of a lot of laughter!
2060,Oh wow!
2061,Definitely stealing this for some summertime fun!
2062,My daughter and I love shrek.
2063,You are an amazing Mama and I know your daughter felt so much joy and love in her life :)
2064,I wish my parents would be understand like you!
2065,I wish my relationship with them isn't bad
2066,Thank you!
2067,I hope you get well soon!
2068,I feel for both of you.
2069,I just got out of my quarantine.
2070,It drains you.
2071,I might be kinda old for this but yesterday was my 21st birthday and nobody remembered except my exes best friend.
2072,Also I didn’t drink because I’m a sorta recovering alcoholic but not really recovering.
2073,And I just got out of the psych ward because sad things.
2074,It’d be kinda nice just to hear someone’s proud of me.
2075,I’m not that bad.
2076,I actually have a lot of unique skills but nobody to really share them with.
2077,Idk I just wanna make someone proud.
2078,Your daughter looks like she was an amazing person.
2079,I’m sorry
2080,"Ah you poor thing, I hope you feel better soon."
2081,"I think it's beautiful that you are taking time out of your day to give others some love, especially if you're not well yourself."
2082,"Keep on keepin' on, sometimes its all we can do."
2083,"Kinda similar here, I donate to Irish Guide Dogs every year on her birthday/anniversary/Christmas."
2084,My mum was very involved with raising guide dogs.
2085,That's a beautiful way to honor her memory.
2086,"I realize you may not want to share the names of local charities (to preserve anonymity), but I'd really like to make a donation in her honor."
2087,Are there any causes or national charities that she felt strongly sbout?
2088,I'm so glad to hear that!
2089,Wishing you continued healing.
2090,💖
2091,"From your beautiful picture and the love you’re giving everyone in the replies, I think she did."
2092,And I hope you can feel her love reaching back to you through us.
2093,"Thank you, I love you too!!"
2094,And I’m trying!
2095,It’s amazing to know I’m not alone.
2096,"Thanks, you’re the best mom ❤️"
2097,Thanks Mom <3
2098,"Omg, that's amazing!"
2099,Love it!
2100,"Gosh, how long did it take to dig a hole big enough for a kid to take a mud bath???"
2101,"I might just fill the kiddie pool with nud once or twice this summer- but gosh, hose water is so, so cold!"
2102,I bet that was an absolute blast!
2103,"Not sure why this one got me, but it did."
2104,"I wish I had a mom who could check in on me like this, one who cares how my day was."
2105,"Thank you for asking, even though it was not my comment <3"
2106,It was good day.
2107,How was your day?
2108,"Hi mom, I just wanted to let you know I talked to my bio mom about it... She didn't freak out."
2109,She almost sounded like she was happy for me.
2110,Maybe my relationship can be repaired with her someday.
2111,"ETA: I saw your daughter died of an overdose, and Im so sorry."
2112,My brother died of an overdose too.
2113,I hope one day you can heal.
2114,"And don't listen to the cruel people, there are some that don't know that addiction happens to anyone, and anyone can get taken with an overdose."
2115,"My mother never fully recovered from it, I don't think."
2116,"One piece of advice for you, If you have other children, make sure they're not living in your daughter's shadow or legacy."
2117,That was really hard for my siblings and I.
2118,I hope so too.
2119,I don't live at home anymore so I don't have to tell her any time soon...
2120,But I probably should.
2121,Ugh.
2122,Thanks mom ❤️
2123,Thank you!
2124,THAAANK YOUUUU
2125,"Good tip, try not to stare, haha."
2126,On another note going to a medium helped me speak with my Mom and come to terms with her death more.
2127,As she said “she could do more for me there then here on earth”.
2128,I like to take that thought with me for comfort.
2129,It felt like my boyfriend was being dismissive towards me.
2130,He works 10+ hr days and I’m staying home atm.
2131,I look forward to him coming home so we can hang out and unwind together.
2132,"He went to spend time with a friend after work, which he did tell me about before he got home."
2133,He said “a few hours”.
2134,He came back in two hours later and said he wasn’t staying but would be home “soon”.
2135,"Essentially, I kept getting “soon” but his tone wasn’t dismissive."
2136,I’d say around 8:30 is when my brain just wasn’t okay with it anymore.
2137,I was getting really mad about constantly being told “soon” but “soon” was almost all night.
2138,I have loads of trauma and something my parents would always do is say “soon” in reference to any and everything I asked and were extremely dismissive.
2139,I’m thinking that his response of “soon” triggered those thoughts.
2140,It feels so dumb to type out.
2141,I’m almost 23 but still feel like such a child.
2142,I am in therapy though.
2143,I’ve been in therapy since I was 11 and have only recently got out of survival mode enough to try and heal.
2144,thanks so much TT O TT
2145,"Thank you, this helped."
2146,It's been a really rough week.
2147,Reciprocating that hug...🤗
2148,"Oh mum you’re always needed here , and of course."
2149,You’re always here supporting us and encouraging us when we need it so it’s only right we do the same in return right.
2150,I’m glad my words can help even if only a little .
2151,I know they can’t take away the grief and the pain but I hope that they bought some comfort.
2152,I can’t say I completely understand how hard it is but I had to say goodbye to a old classmate last year and that was already painful enough.
2153,take care of yourself mum and take peace in the memories.
2154,"Again I’m so so sorry mum , I’m sure your daughter watching you now , smiling seeing what you’re doing for everyone here."
2155,We love you more than words mum ❤️❤️❤️
2156,That sounds like so much fun.
2157,"I grew up in a coastal town and we had a ton of rain, all the time."
2158,One year it rained for 72 days with only a 30 minute break in the middle.
2159,"It was always cold rain though, so I hope I get to experience what you’re describing one day."
2160,Thank you mom.
2161,I hope you recover from covid soon and I am so sorry the universe took your daughter away from you.
2162,You’re amazing
2163,Well thanks.
2164,You as well.
2165,Your daughter is lovely and the two of you look so happy in this picture.
2166,What were you doing that day?
2167,Exciting new tattoo!!
2168,I hope you love it.
2169,"Your thread touched my heart today, I think I'll call my bio mom (even though we talked yesterday) just to chat."
2170,Thank you for reminding me to not take anything for granted.💜
2171,[deleted]
2172,Thank you!
2173,Thanks so much Mama!!
2174,Xo
2175,Yasss you’re the best.
2176,Sorry I’m late.
2177,Need me to fix something?
2178,"Glasses, furniture, is your computer running ok?"
2179,I’m not going near the septic tank remember what happened last time.
2180,Can you make pico de gallo?
2181,Thank you.
2182,"So, so much."
2183,I can’t explain how much that means.
2184,Thank you!
2185,Obviously I didn't know her so I don't really miss her but I know my dad does and sometimes I do wonder how my life would be different if she was still here.
2186,Unfortunately not.
2187,"I live in India, so calling the police won’t do anything."
2188,"Plus, I couldn’t do it even if I would get help."
2189,I love her no matter what she does to me.
2190,Thank you for the kind words though.
2191,It helps.
2192,Thank you mom ♥️
2193,"I will, she hates when i give her bear hugs but damn i love giving them to her."
2194,In real life I really don't.
2195,"I lived with my dad and my mom was verbally abusive :( And even with my dad, it was hard to have a parent-child relationship with him as he was bed ridden."
2196,My grandparents took on most the parenting.
2197,I wanted to comment because I wanted to know what it would feel like to have a good mom.
2198,"And you seem like you really were, I'm sorry for your loss."
2199,Thanks
2200,♥️♥️♥️
2201,Thank you for your kindness 🙏🧡
2202,Oh I'm totally safe I'm just devastated.

2205,It just hurts x
2206,It means the world to me ❤️ Thank you for being sudo-mom to all of us motherless daughters out there.
2207,I'm so sorry for your loss..
2208,"Your kindness and outpouring of love shows what a caring mother you were to your daughter, you are honoring her memory in everything you do ❤️"
2209,Thanks for asking.
2210,":)

Unfortunately…."
2211,No.
2212,"I was really sad today, because my grandpa died earlier this month."
2213,And I’ve been really depressed ever since then.
2214,He was my best friend and closest family member.
2215,"And he was helping me pay for college while I was studying abroad, and now I have to drop out and find a job and omg I’m freaking out, Mom what do I do."
2216,"😭 I freeze up when I get overwhelmed, which just makes things worse, but I can’t stop doing it…"
2217,Thank you!
2218,🙂 Wait… what?!
2219,"Come on now mom, I took out the trash last week!"
2220,And it’s not my turn to empty the dishwasher.
2221,I promise!
2222,"Ugh, you’re the worst!"
2223,*slams door to pout in my room* 😂
2224,Thanks Mom ♥️ I'll try
2225,Mom hugs are the best hugs ever.
2226,Edit: thank you.
2227,Thank you mom!
2228,❤️

2236,"Thank you, I will ❤"
2237,Ty Mom.
2238,I've started a new job and am a manager now.
2239,I don't know how to handle conflict resolution and books are failing me.
2240,I think my boyfriend is about to propose and I really want to share that with you!
2241,"He asked ""gold, white gold, or silver?"""
2242,"And I said ""rose gold!"""
2243,"Wonderful, I'm glad you've got your career path and are progressing."
2244,Anyone would be very lucky to have such a role model parent.
2245,Good luck!
2246,And God bless.
2247,Thanks
2248,"what a beautiful name you gave her, Isabell rose, so sweet"

2257,I totally feel how much you miss your daughter.
2258,"Though we are unable to see those who were gone, but I believe they are still at somewhere and they will be happy to see the people who they are caring about stay strong and healthy."
2259,Thank you.
2260,You too
2261,Back off!
2262,"I will.. if I got it though, can I share my happy news with you?"
2263,"I’m sorry for yours, too."
2264,Our vessel grows around the pain.
2265,Oh God this was a mistake to read this on my period.
2266,I'm crying while trying to eat breakfast.
2267,I would have loved to meet her!
2268,"She sounds like she and I would have been best of friends 🥰♥️♥️

What was her favorite season?"
2269,What was your favorite movie to watch with her?
2270,Did you or her friends give her any nicknames?
2271,"Ok ma, I won't start."
2272,Guess I'll go to college and not be cool.
2273,[deleted]
2274,"Thanks, Dad."
2275,Hugs back.
2276,Thank you so much.
2277,This has helped so much already.
2278,Auntie jumping in!
2279,Hugs and I brought some wine and kleenex.
2280,Squeezes back atcha.
2281,Thank you.
2282,Thanks to you all for all the love and hugs today.
2283,I so needed them.
2284,"And mom, I’m so sorry for your loss."
2285,I’m sorry you have to do this every year.
2286,I wish we didn’t have to.
2287,But we do.
2288,"I have a feeling I’ll think about you again, and when I do, please know I’ll be sending all my good energy to you and hoping you heal better than I have."
2289,Thanks again to you all.
2290,<3
2291,You guys are awesome.
2292,Thank you.
2293,Hugs back!
2294,Of course.
2295,Hugs.
2296,Hugs
2297,She was born April of 1991.
2298,She died January of 93.
2299,"It’s ok.  And I wouldn’t be offended if you corrected me, because for nearly all of these years I have tried my hardest not to do the math."
2300,"I suck at math, so it is something I avoid like the plague."
2301,"When it comes to her, I celebrated her birthday for years because I felt I was betraying her if I didn’t."
2302,"But I’m the one who has to live on, and it was hurting me."
2303,So I stopped.
2304,"She didn’t die naturally, the circumstance are horrific, so I wanted to blot it out."
2305,I had PTSD for 26 years before I finally found some peace with EMDR therapy.
2306,I highly recommend it.
2307,But I only know how old she’d be now because my daughter (who is disabled) has a nurse who is the same age and she’s been with us for years.
2308,But I appreciate your comments.
2309,I know they were not meant to be anything but kind.
2310,I thank you all for making today so much better.
2311,"OP, biggest hugs from me for helping ME out today, when you needed it just as badly."
2312,That was super kind and selfless of you to share the hugs and the love and share of yourself.
2313,You’re a fantastic mom.
2314,Hugs back.
2315,Thank you.
2316,Me too—except they look so similar!
2317,(And so very happy.)
2318,Hi Mum!
2319,I’m a single Mom in the states and I feel you!
2320,There is so much anxiety around money right now.
2321,"I have family in the UK, so I understand just a little bit of the turmoil CoVid on top of Brexit has caused on that side of the pond."
2322,Know that there is someone in your life that cares and wants to help.
2323,"Now that you’ve said it out loud, the hard part of accepting the issue is done."
2324,We spend a lot of time as Mums being strong and protecting the people we care about from emotional harm….
2325,Sometimes by not mentioning our own concerns.
2326,But you’ve done that now.
2327,You said it out loud!
2328,Worry isn’t going away until you take action to do what you can to improve the situation.
2329,Move onto solutions and look for the opportunity to be vulnerable and ask for the help that is waiting in the wings.
2330,Helping someone we care about through a rocky patch can be a gift to ourselves just as much as it is to the recipient.
2331,We all want to feel needed and valued….. especially us Moms.
2332,It’s our oxygen!
2333,Give someone who needs that feeling the opportunity to help you so you can pay it forward when your feet are on more solid financial ground.
2334,I hope your current situation gets better.
2335,"Hope everything went well, sibling ❤️ that was a lot of stuff to do all in one day."
2336,I hope you're resting now!
2337,I get that.
2338,"It's never as bad as I fear.....but I still get anxious the next time, and that's okay."
2339,I'm proud of you for going.
2340,I hope the results are what you're hoping for.
2341,Crying in the lunch room.
2342,:'(
2343,Thank you.
2344,We would do Shrek and Donkey voices.
2345,Never failed to find a nice rock on those days.
2346,Haha.
2347,I just relaxed I put whole instead of hole.
2348,Haha
2349,I'm sorry that your relationship with your parents is bad.
2350,I hope things get better in the future and if they don't I hope that you find happiness in another place.
2351,As a side note I work in the hospital with Covid patients.
2352,Make sure to practice diaphragmatic breathing and not breathing with your shoulders.
2353,Helps keep those oxygen levels up!
2354,Happy belated birthday.
2355,You're doing amazing and I'm super duper proud of you!
2356,It may not be the same coming from an internet mom but you're going to do great things in life and you will find happiness somewhere.
2357,❤
2358,Happy Birthday!
2359,21 is a big number and the world is ready to unfold for you but you gotta shout out what you expect from the Universe and everything will present itself at the right time.
2360,Please tell me about your unique skills!
2361,!
2362,"Another mom here - 

First, Happy birthday!"
2363,"Secondly, I'm sorry about the sad things."
2364,I don't understand why such sad things happen to good people.
2365,"I don't believe you're bad, not at all  What your unique skills????"
2366,?
2367,Hey cousin!
2368,Happy belated birthday!
2369,"What you're describing sounds similar to my own early 20s, and friend, I'm beyond impressed by you!"
2370,"You're working through some really rough stuff, you didn't drink on an alcohol-centric birthday, AND you're at a point where you're able to actively reach out for comfort!"
2371,"Those are all major accomplishments, and I'm really freaking proud of you!"
2372,"Also, I'd love to hear more about your unique skills."
2373,What are some of your favorites?
2374,Hey there!
2375,Happy 21st birthday from a stranger in London!!
2376,You should be proud of yourself and your own skills.
2377,Take care of yourself.
2378,Much love from a dad of three kids.
2379,What a wonderful way to honor her memory.
2380,It was always so much fun!
2381,Well how was your day as well?
2382,Do anything fun or interesting?
2383,She was my only baby.
2384,I'm glad things worked out with your bio mom.
2385,Please keep it down.
2386,This is a public forum.
2387,Have you discussed the soon issue with your boyfriend.
2388,It sounds like a stressful situation to be in.
2389,Has the therapy helped?
2390,Maybe there's a different therapeutic route you can try?
2391,I would like to experience rain like that.
2392,"Just once though, don't know if I could handle it all the time."
2393,Our monsoon season is during the summer so it's always warm rain.
2394,Sometimes the sun is out and it makes such a pretty sight.
2395,Hugs💙
2396,I wish there was more I could do for you.
2397,That made me smile.
2398,I'm so sorry I made that assumption and I'm sorry that you had it so rough.
2399,I wish I could give you a real hug but a virtual one will have to do.
2400,"Also, make sure to take care of yourself."
2401,You lost a brother and are hurting too.
2402,Take time to be kind to yourself and recognize that you are grieving too.
2403,Oh good.
2404,Ending a relationship is always hard.
2405,I hope that things will be better for you soon.
2406,I'm so sorry for your loss.
2407,Is there now way for you to continue your studies studies working?
2408,Hugs 💙
2409,Of course!
2410,Very well worded.
2411,"Her friends called her Isabear or Izzy, her dad's family called her Isa and I called her Stinky face."
2412,Her favorite season was fall and she loved dressing up for Halloween.
2413,"Favorite movies included, the labyrinth, osmosis Jones, Kiki delivery service, Peter pan (British version) and so many more."
2414,We were both obsessed with Dr. Who and Firefly.
2415,You put a smile on my face today.
2416,Stay uncool man.
2417,I think it’s a joke about cutting off the circulation in your wrists (unless I’m wrong in which case that is pretty fucked up.)
2418,It’s not a joke about cutting wrist.
2419,It’s a description of blood circulation gets cut off when you stay in a position for too long or squeezing something too hard.
2420,Hugs to you all.
2421,Thank you.

2443,It just seems like a waste of time.
2444,Music makes me less depressed.
2445,That’s it.
2446,I’ve spoken German to one person one time.

2458,It’s because of people like you that I’m still here.
2459,Thank you so much.
2460,"Nope, your interpretation (along with 100 other upvotes) is how I meant my message to be - that you squeeze someone so hard you cut off your own blood circulation."
2461,Thanks for chiming in.
2462,Thank you.
2463,Again.
2464,"And I used to ask “why me?”  Now I ask, if not me, then who?"

2467,Thank you for your kindness.
2468,"Yay, good!!!"
2469,I'm really proud of you.
2470,"I hope the results from the tests are either uneventful, OR they give you and your care team the answers you need!"
2471,There’s something that feels soo good about being home in bed after a long day of medical appointments/tests.
2472,I know all too well just how draining that stuff can be.
2473,"So proud of you sis, you did great!"
2474,!
2475,I’m proud of you too!
2476,My daughters have anxiety and I’m so proud of them when they tackle something they are not wanting to do.

2493,That’s sound fun.
2494,What did it take to be the best person at your workplace?
2495,Please tell me about your new job.
2496,"So, when you said unique, I thought you were going to say something like you were good at raising worms (I know someone who raises worms, and he's good at it!)."
2497,"Your skills aren't just unique, they're also super valuable."
2498,You have a lot to be proud of.
2499,Adding music and beautiful language to the world is amazing.
2500,"Depression's a bitch and a liar, and it can make it difficult to recognize our own gifts and accomplishments, so let me recognize them for you: six languages?!"

2523,But I’m a specialist now.
2524,More money less hours.
2525,Idk.
2526,It feels like a waste of time.
2527,I’ve only ever used one other language one time.
2528,I really hope so.
2529,It seems like the more I try the worse it gets.
2530,I just got out of the psych ward.
2531,I e been trying.
2532,Doing yoga and working out and eating healthy and forcing myself to go outside and shower/keep my apartment clean
2533,You’ve got a strong work ethic & have accomplish quite a bit at 21.
2534,Very impressive!
2535,You have many talents.

2540,You got this!!!
2541,Big hugs!!!!!!
2542,!
2543,You know what doesn't fit well?
2544,A boyfriend who makes you feel insecure about your choices.
2545,"That dress is lovely, fits beautiful, and suits your skin tone."
2546,What's not to love?!
2547,You look like a fairy princess and you should feel like one!
2548,!
2549,That's a beautiful dress!
2550,"Looks like it fits you nicely, also."
2551,Tell your boyfriend to shut his face.
2552,"If he didn't buy it, and didn't come with you to pick it out, he gets no opinion."
2553,Have fun at prom!
2554,The dress is beautiful.
2555,Why does he hate it?
2556,"This is an incredible, high end, super fancy prom dress and I'm frankly jealous lol WEAR IT WITH CONFIDENCE!"
2557,"The dress is beautiful, the boyfriend is a whole news-stand of issues."
2558,"Screw him, it's contemporary Cinderella."
2559,"As your mom, he is no longer welcome for lasagna."
2560,And I make a top notch lasagna.
2561,I don’t feed people who are rude to my children.
2562,"He hasn’t learned the first lesson of relationships — “honey, you look beautiful”."
2563,"You do, and you will."
2564,I had a princess style dress and my hair was a pixie cut and I felt very modern and pretty for my prom.
2565,You’ll look great too.
2566,Edit: I think it’s time for a Mom for a Minute cookbook
2567,"You’ll have exactly two events in your life that are definitely appropriate for a dress like yours, prom and your wedding."
2568,Live it up and wear that gorgeous dress.
2569,It is absolutely stunning and it fits you perfectly.
2570,"Your boyfriend has no idea what he’s talking about, I promise."
2571,He said he thinks it’s too extravagant and it’s not what he had in mind for prom.
2572,No one has ever worn anything close to this so it makes sense.
2573,He said he likes the dress in general and if I want to I should wear it.
2574,Hey sis!
2575,"Beautiful dress, I love the colour and the detailing, and it looks amazing on you!"
2576,Can we talk about your boyfriend for a minute?
2577,Saying he hates the dress is such a strong reaction.
2578,Does he express negative judgements about you often?
2579,Does he try to tell you how to dress?
2580,I dont want to jump to conclusions but I want to make sure you're ok
2581,Where’d you get that from?
2582,It looks absolutely gorgeous!
2583,Gives of “I’m a princess in a fairytale” vibes.
2584,The dress is rad.
2585,Tell your boyfriend to stay home and ask a friend to go instead.
2586,I love it!!
2587,It's beautiful and fits beautifully!
2588,That dress is drop dead gorgeous!
2589,It’s perfect for you and it’s going to be a beautiful dress for prom.
2590,Your boyfriend is wrong and I’m sorry he’s being so unkind.
2591,I hope your prom is wonderful!
2592,omg it’s prom!!
2593,go alll out!!
2594,YOU LOOK LIKE A PRINCESS!!
2595,"if your boyfriend can’t appreciate it, that’s his loss!"
2596,you look beautiful 🥰🥰
2597,"This dress fits you well, it flatters you, and it’s 100% appropriate for prom."
2598,"It’s too bad he doesn’t love it, but that’s seriously not your concern."
2599,"**We don’t dress for men’s approval, we dress for ourselves."
2600,"**

I’m concerned about this boyfriend and the way he handled this."
2601,It’s really important that you date people who show they care about your comfort and well being.
2602,"If you had a date pick out a dress you didn’t care for, how would you behave?"
2603,Because I really doubt you’d be insensitive about something this special that they were naturally excited about.
2604,He should have kept it to himself if he wouldn’t have chosen the same dress.
2605,And he should have reassured you that you look *beautiful* no matter what you wear.
2606,Sounds like he didn’t think of that.
2607,Notice how he talks to you.
2608,Notice how it feels.
2609,Then consider how you’d show love and respect for someone if you were in his shoes.
2610,Your style is cool.
2611,You look like a queen.
2612,Do exactly what you want even if others don’t validate it.
2613,Hold your beautiful head high.
2614,Have a wonderful time at prom!
2615,"Sib, I see your comments saying your boyfriend says it’s too much for much."
2616,Sib for my prom I wore I dress similar to this in a lime green color that looked like Princess Tiana’s dress.
2617,"My dress was huge, even a bit bigger than yours."
2618,I had to hold half of it up anytime I walked and I took up the whole back seat of a car by myself.
2619,But I loved every second of it.
2620,"I definitely didn’t look like any other girl there, but I looked great, like you do in your dress!"
2621,Just because things haven’t been done before doesn’t mean we can’t do them!
2622,It’s good to be different sometimes and I think this is one of those times sib!
2623,You should wear the dress and for future don’t let your boyfriend influence what you wear!
2624,"I know you think he’s just being helpful, but I think he should be happy to see his girlfriend look amazing in a very stunning dress no matter if it has been done before or not."
2625,"Sending you a lot of love sib <3 
I hope your prom goes great!"
2626,"Oh honey, it makes you look like a fairy princess!"
2627,"I love the color, and it fits you so well."
2628,Don't ever regret something that makes you feel beautiful.
2629,"He doesn't have to wear the dress, that dress is for YOU."
2630,"And you're right, you are gorgeous!"
2631,"Hey love, never take fashion advice from a teenage boy."
2632,They have absolutely no idea what they're talking about.
2633,I am sure of this as I have two and half the time their shirts are on backwards and their socks don't match.
2634,You look fantastic.
2635,The color is gorgeous and the cut really suits your shape.
2636,You are one strapless bra from perfection.
2637,It looks great; the colour suits your skintone and it is very festive.
2638,"It fits you very well, too!"
2639,Men can be very peculiar about what they like unfortunately and it sounds as if he thinks that the dress shouldn't be as playful/whimsical.
2640,"He absolutely has no say in which dress you choose, but I understand that knowing he doesn't like it might spoil your prom night."
2641,Maybe the two of you can talk about it in a few days (take some time to reflect on the issue)?
2642,It’s gorgeous and looks amazing on you.
2643,Your dress is absolutely beautiful and it fits so well!
2644,"I graded in 2004 and one of my peers spent $500 on her dress (well her parents did, you get the idea)."
2645,"Mine was simple and on sale, less than $100, and honestly I wish my dress had been fancier."
2646,Your dress is perfect!
2647,I love that shade of blue and all the detailed sewing.
2648,Have fun at prom!
2649,🎉🎊
2650,"Keep the dress, ditch the boy."
2651,"Nah, the dress is lovely though and as long as you feel good, remember what it is that you first loved about it and forget any external input."
2652,So .. did *you* love the dress before your bf started expressing his opinions?
2653,Are you thinking he's right because of how vocal  (or hurtful)  he's been when voicing said opinions?
2654,"You look beautiful,  and the dress is gorgeous."
2655,"Your boyfriend sounds like the turd in the punchbowl, though."
2656,The dress is exquisite.
2657,Lose the boyfriend not the dress!
2658,I'm sorry your bf gave you negative feedback on something you really like.
2659,I think it's beautiful!
2660,"People wear all kinds of things to prom and the last thing you want is to blend in with the crowd of similar strappy dresses with huge heels, I really hope you keep it and wear it."
2661,I'd tell your bf that he's being goofy and say I only have 1 prom and I am going wear whatever I want.
2662,"Your boyfriend isn't wearing it, so he can shut his face."
2663,Get a new boyfriend
2664,I’m not a mom but my first thought was “wow that’s a gorgeous dress and I wish I had somewhere to go so I can wear it:)” you look amazing and that dress is perfect!
2665,"In the illustrious words of Mama RuPaul “unless they gonna pay your bills, pay them bitches no mind”!"
2666,It’s the perfect prom dress.
2667,"Wear it with pride and the fabulousness that you are, sweetheart."
2668,"Girl, the next time he tries to claim something like ""too much for prom"" you laugh in his face!"
2669,What does he think that prom is for little cotton sundresses?
2670,No!
2671,"It is for big, glorious, floofy gowns, or long slinky gowns or amazingly spectacular suits!"
2672,Be glorious my princess!
2673,"Accessorize, get your hair done, experiment with new makeup with friends."
2674,Let nothing stop the fun and anticipation of prom night!
2675,"At my equivalent of prom night we had a couple girls dump their partners right before the whole prom event, one of the guys in our grade escorted anyone who wanted a partner but didn't have one."
2676,Some girls walked on their own to hog in the limelight.
2677,"There's only one wrong way to do prom, and I'll tell you if you like."
2678,The way to do prom wrong: spend the whole time worrying about other people.
2679,"Have your friends backs, of course."
2680,But don't let anyone take your fun from you!
2681,"Your dress is beautiful, I hope your boyfriends criticisms get easier to ignore so you can get back to loving your gown!"
2682,"It’s so pretty, the colour is subtle and sophisticated and that perfectly balances the little bit of extra that is the (gorgeous) beading."
2683,"It fits you so well and I bet you just shine in it, BUT someone is trying to dull your shine and undermine your confidence (which is 90% of looking good) and I hate that for you."
2684,"What is the deal with your boyfriend because what he’s doing isn’t kind, and you deserve better."
2685,"Maybe he’s intimidated by how good you look, maybe he’s controlling, maybe he wants to hurt you because a confident you doesn’t need him, idk but none of these makes him a good person."
2686,Even if he genuinely dislikes the dress that’s his problem and a supportive boyfriend would tell you you’re beautiful in a plastic bag.
2687,"Keep the dress, lose the bf."
2688,Wow that's a gorgeous dress that looks great  on you.
2689,I've been learning a lot about healthy boundaries lately - what YOU wear is your business and should make YOU happy and make YOU feel good.
2690,No one else has a say.
2691,He can kick rocks.
2692,\*hugs\* you're gorgeous and so is that dress :) rock it!
2693,"As a 28year old dude, who didn't get the chance to go to my own."
2694,YOUR DRESS IS DAMN FINE.
2695,Drop bf if he does negging Shite like that.
2696,"Been there, done that."
2697,Fuck that noise.
2698,"Shit I'm not a nice person, I just try to be the best I can."
2699,"Dress is fine, color is fine, decor is fine."
2700,"Now the real question, will you be with your negging bf or will you be going stag?"
2701,"Going alone is fine, going with someone who make you feel bad, cheap or any kind of negative emotion to an event that you will remember till you drop is not worth it."
2702,Don't let anyone cheat you out of great memories.
2703,Take it from someone who had all his stolen.
2704,"Be safe, be loved and most importantly have fun."
2705,Oh honey.
2706,This dress is amazing and perfect for prom.
2707,Your boyfriend needs to keep his opinions to himself.
2708,"My dress for prom wasn't a""prom"" dress either, but I still wore it anyway, and I think so fondly of that dress and that day."
2709,You look amazing.
2710,This dress looks amazing.
2711,the neckline is beautiful and the colour looks great on your skin tone.
2712,what is he on about it's a super cute dress
2713,Oh hun its beautiful!!
2714,You should dress up for prom !
2715,It fits your body perfectly!!
2716,Be careful with that boyfriend- don't let him live in your head rent free - you look like q queen and he shouldn't bring you down
2717,"Not mom but as a sister

Are you starting to dislike the dress or do you just value his opinion more than your own?"
2718,"You bought the dress, so I'd assume you liked it.. Until your boyfriend didn't."
2719,"He's allowed to not like something but please, please stick to your own believes and opinions even after listening to his."
2720,"Don't lose yourself trying to keep him pleased, take care of yourself 💜"
2721,Wow this is so beautiful!!!!
2722,He’s probably insecure with himself as all men are.
2723,It’s quite lovely.
2724,You love it.
2725,Fits your curves perfectly.
2726,BF can go suck eggs.
2727,The only thing I can think of that’s a problem is that there’s so much dress it could be difficult to get in and out of smaller cars.
2728,Is that his problem?.
2729,Or does he feel intimidated by such elegance and can’t say that?
2730,Is he emo or goth or country and just not his style?
2731,so what?
2732,It’s your prom and he doesn’t get to be the fashion police.
2733,Big sister here.
2734,That dress is gorgeous.
2735,"I know you usually steal my clothes, but I might have to be stealing that one 🥰."
2736,You look amazing.
2737,"If your boyfriend doesn't like it, he doesn't have to look at it."
2738,"As a middle aged man, I will gladly say this as a your mom right now."
2739,"This is a very beautiful and elegant dress, please wear it with pride my dear."
2740,I would have been speachless 🥰.
2741,Your boyfriend should be ashamed of himself 😤.
2742,He does not seem to be worthy of you my dear 🥰
2743,"Baby girl, you listen to your mama!"
2744,Do not let ANY MAN dim your motherfuckin light or dilute your vibrancy.
2745,What does he know?
2746,Only how to make dumbass comments?
2747,You look like a gorgeous prom queen.
2748,Nurture every.
2749,single.
2750,moment that makes you feel beautiful and carry those moments with you throughout life.
2751,"So many people, even those who love you, will discourage you from feeling beautiful the *way you want to feel beautiful* ."
2752,"Consider this practice, mija."
2753,"Be as bright and colorful and ""too much"" as you want to."
2754,"If you’re keeping the boyfriend, insist on a beautiful corsage to compliment the dress."
2755,The color is nice.
2756,What color is your hair and how do you plan on it?
2757,Have you picked out a makeup palette to match?
2758,Accessorizing this neckline will only make it more beautiful!
2759,You picked it out because it spoke to you!
2760,I wore a strapless golden yellow Beauty and the Beast-esque for senior “lead out” at my school.
2761,I started to regret it similarly to you.
2762,But looking back I’m so glad I embraced it and followed my heart and wants!
2763,I hope you will as well.
2764,"💜 

I can’t help but think about the beautiful corsage colors that would pop with this seafoamy dream!"
2765,"You’ll look stunning, and I wish for you that you’ll *feel* stunning as well."
2766,Edit: some eucalyptus and your choice of complimentary colored flower of choice- I’m partial to tea roses- would look lovely!
2767,Bonus points for mini succulents on it!
2768,I’m totally out of touch of what the trends even are in the last 5 years for prom but I know corsages are timeless!
2769,So is having confidence in yourself.
2770,"I hope you’ll pamper yourself for your prom and feel comfortable and beautiful in your skin, u/fluffybabycow!"
2771,I think it is gorgeous!
2772,You will look like the Belle of the ball!
2773,I think it is a beautiful dress that fits really well and a wonderful colour as well.
2774,"Oh hun, that looks wonderful on you!"
2775,What a great choice!
2776,Omg I love it its beautiful!
2777,!
2778,I think it's lovely; your boyfriend sounds like a jerk.
2779,"Idk what shoes you picked but if this is full length, i suggest a flat shoe or closed toe pump."
2780,Strappy heels are cute and fun but it's not worth the headache.
2781,"Pro tip: if you DO choose heels, spray your feet with lanacane before a night out and you will thank me later."
2782,"Im not even a mom, I’m a dad I guess and I say this dress is beautiful!"
2783,Looks great on you too.
2784,Don’t let your boyfriend get to you!
2785,!
2786,"Sis, you kidding me right now?"
2787,That dress is gorgeous!!
2788,"I have no idea what his problem is, but don't let him bring you down no matter why he's acting this way."
2789,"Wear that dress, and wear it proudly!"
2790,!
2791,"Get a new boyfriend, this is very pretty"
2792,Your boyfriend doesn't sound like a nice person.
2793,Why would someone ever say that to another human.
2794,Sib you look like a princess or a queen.
2795,You look stunning.
2796,The dress is amazing as well.
2797,It’s gorgeous!
2798,I personally love the embroidery.
2799,You’ll certainly have the best dress at dance.
2800,"Dudes who moan generally wear jeans to formal, so it’s not worth your time even to listen"
2801,Hi little sis!
2802,I just want to say that when I saw that dress I immediately thought you look like Cinderella.
2803,It’s such a pretty dress and looks fabulous.
2804,"Don’t listen to your boyfriend, he’ll see on prom night how many compliments you get on it!"
2805,Your dress is beautiful!
2806,"I love the color and the detail work, it's not too busy but interesting enough to allow the eye to flow from area to area."
2807,"As far as prom dresses go, it's pretty traditional even!"
2808,"Not really sure what there is to dislike, really 😕 

Unless he's the one wearing the dress, he doesn't get much say!"
2809,Don't let him bully you over something as little as clothes.
2810,"If you two are old enough for prom, he is old enough to know he has no business grousing about your beautiful dress and ought to keep his mouth shut."
2811,"I'd talk with him, pick his brain a bit."
2812,"Why doesn't he like it, specifically?"
2813,"If he doesn't give you a real, honest answer, you can tell him he can go to prom alone."
2814,Imagine him explaining to his friends and family why his date skipped prom when shed already bought a dress?
2815,Absolutely embarrassing.
2816,I think it’s gorgeous and looks amazing on you!
2817,"If your boyfriend hates it, find another boy who will treat you like the princess you are."
2818,NO.
2819,"It is sincerely a beautiful, timeless look for a dress."
2820,You could easily rewear this as a guest to a fancy wedding.
2821,I love the embroidery and the boat neck collar.
2822,I also fully adore the silhouette with a full skirt.
2823,It is a beautiful dress and you look lovely in it!!!
2824,I feel so agitated that your boyfriend said that he hates it.
2825,"I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt because you’re in high school, but he should really learn some basic consideration and understand that you put a lot of time, thought, and money into making this purchase."
2826,He should sit down with his rented suit.
2827,"It's gorgeous, fits great as well."
2828,Ignore him
2829,You look like a Princess.
2830,It's a beautiful dress!
2831,"Oh honey it’s beautiful, and so are you!"
2832,It fits you perfectly and looks amazing.
2833,Time for a new boyfriend who respects you and your choices and thinks you’re  amazing because you are!
2834,Why does your boyfriend have such a strong opinion on something you’re wearing?
2835,"I don’t know him, but this is a red flag."
2836,I’ve never felt so strongly about my partner wearing something that I felt the need to put it down to them.
2837,Tread with caution!
2838,"I was mindlessly scrolling when this gorgeous dress made me stop…

Sweetie, you look stunning!"
2839,The dress is beautiful and fits you really well.
2840,The only thing that matters is how you feel when you wear it.
2841,"If it makes feel anywhere near as good as you look, keep the dress and tell your “boyfriend” that he doesn’t get to control what you wear."
2842,Enjoy your prom.
2843,You look like a princess!
2844,"The dress is beautiful, I love the color, and the fit is superb."
2845,The only accessory I don't like about it is the boyfriend.
2846,"He should be worried about how the dress makes you feel, and only that."
2847,"If I were you, I'd take him to a dress shop and ask him which of the (very expensive) dresses he would like to purchase for you."
2848,My guess is he will change his tune pretty quickly.
2849,[deleted]
2850,Your boyfriend is being dumb.
2851,Tell him I said so.
2852,-- Dad for a minute

2876,It looks amazing on you and your skin tone.
2877,The color is glorious and the cut is beautiful.
2878,It's perfect.
2879,Maybe dump the dude and go with friends who can appreciate beauty.
2880,The boyfriend is a tool to have said that.
2881,Phenomenal!
2882,You look gorgeous in it!
2883,Beautiful colour on you and a perfect fit.
2884,Have a great time at prom and don't put much thought into what your boyfriend said.
2885,He's being insensitive and probably insecure because you look like a million bucks.
2886,I'm proud of you!
2887,"Love, mom"
2888, That dress is so pretty on you!
2889,"I don see how someone could dislike it, except for petty reasons."
2890,"Keep the dress, dump the boy, life’s too short IMHO."
2891,"This is beautiful, what gorgeous details in the dress!"
2892,"Your boyfriend is wrong, don't let him tear you down or doubt yourself."
2893,You look great!
2894,that’s a stunning dress!

2896,you picked it for a reason and look so beautiful in it!
2897,It's gorgeous and you look amazing!
2898,You look like a princess!
2899,"I love the embellishments and the color- subtle, but unique."
2900,This dress is choice that is both timeless and modern- don’t let anyone make you doubt your decision!
2901,That dress is absolutely beautiful and fits you wonderfully.
2902,"I wish I had a dress like that for my prom, it's stunning."
2903,"He really needs to learn one of the first rules of being a good boyfriend, which is to support whatever your girlfriend is wearing if it obviously made her happy!!"
2904,"What an idiot, you look absolutely wonderful darling."
2905,I am in love with that bodice and neckline!!
2906,"It's a surprise to me that he would think it's ""too much"" for prom."
2907,Prom is one of the only times one can get away with a big poofy princess dress!
2908,"I'm just about 30 and still have mine from junior prom lol, I love it!"
2909,"It’s a gorgeous embellished dress, beautiful color and sis look at that hourglass silhouette!"
2910,"Your BF doesn’t know what he’s talking about

Please don’t switch to a dress you like less for a man."
2911,"""A woman should dress first and foremost for her own pleasure."""
2912,"Edit: If your BF makes a habit out of putting you down, please get rid of the man"
2913,The dress is beautiful and I just know you look beautiful in it.
2914,Your boyfriend is wrong but more importantly the person you give your love to should only want to make you feel better and more beautiful.
2915,You’re young so this is a very important lesson for you.
2916,"Surround yourself with those who make you feel like your best self, people who see you in a beautiful elegant dress and feel badly for all the other dresses that you passed over."
2917,"Prom is your opportunity to be formal and playful, your dress is more than enough now it’s your boyfriend turn to step up."
2918,I’m really excited for what a fun night you’ll have.
2919,I think it looks like something royalty would wear and clearly he missed the opportunityto call you his princess.
2920,If he didn't go with you to pick it out or pay for it then he can keep his opinions to himself.
2921,Its so beautiful!
2922,Your boyfriend needs to learn that women don't only dress to please men.
2923,"Plus, even if it's not his personal style, he should be happy that you're happy."
2924,That's how my husband was ( our first date was prom)
2925,Tell your bf that I’m gonna bippity boppity drop kick his ass if he talks anymore shit about your gorgeous Cinderella dress.
2926,You look elegant and timeless.
2927,"Love,
Your fairy godsis"
2928,Dress is beautiful and so is the color.
2929,It compliments you well.
2930,"Better question, do YOU feel beautiful in it?"
2931,"If yes, wear it."
2932,Don't let your boyfriend's terrible attitude ruin this for you.
2933,"Well hun, if he plans on wearing it, you can go ahead and send it back."
2934,"Otherwise, enjoy your dress and your prom."
2935,Stag.
2936,Lovely!
2937,"And that color, amazing."
2938,It's a very nice fit.
2939,I hope you have a good prom deary.
2940,He can suck it😂 you look like a princess!
2941,!😍
2942,"Cousin here, couldn’t scroll past this post especially cause you are starting to regret it."
2943,"Don’t you look amazing, the dress is fantastic and the color is great."
2944,Hits you just right in all the spots.
2945,And frankly cuz I’m jealous.
2946,Rock it!
2947,"Hi, not mom but big sister!"
2948,Dude your dress is so freaking pretty!
2949,Had I gone to prom I’d probably wear it too!
2950,"From the neckline, to the bodice, to the beautiful flowy dress it looks like a princess dress!"
2951,You should wear it proudly!
2952,I love the color it’s just enough and it’s definitely not to much for prom.
2953,I’ve seen girls with much more extravagant dresses.
2954,That is perfect and looks so good on you!
2955,I love the dress.
2956,"Great color, great fit."
2957,Everyone's gonna have different tastes but really what matters is what you think and feel.
2958,You also have the right to set boundaries with your boyfriend about  his comments.
2959,"Even if he doesn't particularly like it, you deserve support and to feel awesome."
2960,"If he can't say something nice to say about the dress, that says something about him... and not you or your dress."
2961,My spouse has a wildly different taste than me And we both can say nice things about each other's outfits and how they look without highlighting things we don't like because we respect each other's feelings.
2962,Not a mom but a dad...
2963,I think it's lovely.
2964,What really makes it those .. white vines?
2965,Coming down.
2966,It's a beautiful dress.
2967,It's GORGEOUS.
2968,I can't understand why he would hate it.
2969,You look beautiful.
2970,"I don't know either of you, so my only advice is to be open and honest with him about how you felt when you picked it out, and how his feedback is affecting you."
2971,"I know it's easier said than done, especially at your age, but it's the best thing to do."
2972,"Dad checking in-

1."
2973,Wear what you want.
2974,Prom is fancy dress-up night.
2975,2.
2976,It looks awesome!
2977,"Wow, the dress is perfect on you!"
2978,"It flatters your body type perfectly, and the color is great on you."
2979,"The cut is classic and lovely, and I think your boyfriend needs his eyes checked."
2980,"You look like a princess, if you have any pearl jewelry that would look nice with this, especially with the detailing on the sleeves."
2981,Just remember glass slippers are not comfortable and will give you blisters before the night is through.
2982,As a father with a daughter going through this phase of school that dress looks nice dont regret your decision because of a boy.
2983,we are jerks in high school .
2984,have a great prom .
2985,My daughter is 6 and was peeping at my screen.
2986,"She said she needs this princess dress since thats a real girl (you know, NOT a cartoon *she whispered*) who is wearing that dress."
2987,"You are a real life princess and if that boyfriend of yours (or any future ones) don’t treat you as such and straighten out your crown when you forget it’s on your head, you best find someone who will- whether its a new boyfriend, a best friend or a group of moms."
2988,Have fun at prom and be safe.
2989,So you have 1300+ comments so I’ll doubt you’ll see this.
2990,Personally I don’t love your dress but look any boyfriend who insults your dress is a bit of a dick.
2991,So…yeah if you like it tell your boyfriend to stfu
2992,"If the opinion of a gay man in his 30's scrolling through r/all means anything, it's a great prom dress."
2993,"It fits perfectly, it's elegant and unique without being too much."
2994,The detailing is of classic inspiration in a contemporary fit.
2995,"The color is also a classic choice, I'd have said it should have a universal appeal."
2996,"The cut of it should allow plenty of freedom of movement if you like to dance, too."
2997,"I'm sorry your boyfriend has been awful about it, I've no idea what he sees wrong in the dress."
2998,It's lovely and perfectly suited to the occasion.
2999,I saw this dress and thought I was on r/sewing and someone was showing off their fabulous work … again.
3000,Seriously this dress is gorgeous!
3001,Heck I wish I looked this good in my prom dress.
3002,You look wonderful!
3003,It’s a perfect princess or garden fairy vibe dress and it looks great on you.
3004,Don’t regret the dress or feel like you need to get a different one.
3005,"Instead, return the boyfriend."
3006,He doesn’t deserve to be on your arm at prom.
3007,I was looking for the joke or something hidden.
3008,Then I realized this was a serious question.
3009,"Because, that dress is beautiful and looks great on you."
3010,The only thing you should regret is that boyfriend :p
3011,Back when I had my prom I allowed my date to convince me to not wear something I wanted and was excited about.
3012,"Honestly, I regret not wearing what I wanted and dumping her."
3013,"High school stuff matters in high school, you'll probably barely remember this boyfriend in a few years anyway but drip is eternal."
3014,"Seriously, there's a certain amount of respect you need to show yourself, and a part of that is not changing yourself for others, even those that are close to us."
3015,I can almost guarantee you'll regret it if you don't wear the dress.
3016,I want to punch him
3017,Omg you look so pretty!
3018,A stunning young lady!
3019,"That ""boy"" of yours probably wants something sexy where he can see your curves and ""hurr hurr look at my girl"" while you chose something classy."
3020,Keep the dress...maybe toss the boyfriend?
3021,Remember: you do NOT need a date to prom.
3022,You can go alone and enjoy yourself with your friends.
3023,Return your boyfriend
3024,"Former and reformed emotional abuser here, he is definitely saying that to lower your self esteem and make you question yourself."
3025,It is 100% a control tactic.
3026,"It is an absolutely lovely dress, he has a lot of maturing and growing to do."
3027,"Trust yourself, you picked well!"
3028,The dress is beautiful.
3029,It's the boyfriend that is bad.
3030,It's simply beautiful!
3031,I love everything about it.
3032,"The color,  the fabric, the length, the style are just lovely and classic."
3033,It reminds me of something Grace Kelly or Elizabeth Taylor would wear to the Oscars.
3034,You have outstanding taste.
3035,"Hon, you are giving me queen vibes and you know what queens don't take?"
3036,"Blind, rude boyfriends to prom."
3037,It may not be his cup of tea but if you feel beautiful then he needs to zip his lips and support your happiness.
3038,I love it!
3039,I love it!
3040,I bet when you move around it sways just right.
3041,Its my favorite color.
3042,You rock it!
3043,Never trust a teenage boy for fashion advice.
3044,OP let me give you my two cents since most commenters here seem to be insane people trying to psycho analyze your high school boyfriend into a psychotic abuser.
3045,It is your prom night and you should go dressed however you want.
3046,"He has a right to dislike the dress, and he could have expressed this in a much better way."
3047,"However, he just going to have to deal with it."
3048,Do what makes YOU happy.
3049,These asocial psychopaths on Reddit really fucking spook me.
3050,I wonder if they were raised in some desert by huntsman spiders.
3051,Christ everyone here needs to calm down her boyfriend doesn’t like her dress it’s not that big of a deal everyone’s talking like he’s an crazy abusive sadist we know nothing of their relationship what we do know is he doesn’t like her dress that’s all
3052,"Regardless of the price, the embroidery is a little overpowering/gaudy to me and imo cheapens the look of the dress."
3053,"The color and cut is honestly fine, but if the embroidery is one of the things your boyfriend takes major issue with, I get it."
3054,But if you like it you do you.
3055,It’s a little matronly
3056,I'd suggest getting a new boyfriend before I'd suggest getting a new dress!
3057,I'm kidding.
3058,"But seriously, the dress looks great."
3059,Tell your boyfriend you like it and that you won't be changing it so he can stop giving you his opinions.
3060,If he doesn't want to match with you that's ok.
3061,Enjoy looking like a princess and have a great prom!
3062,What?
3063,That dress is serious Cinderella vibes.
3064,He needs a talking to!
3065,Hi kiddo.
3066,The dress is gorgeous.
3067,"Maybe he was hoping it would be sexy, and you wanted to feel like a princess."
3068,"Some people just have different taste, and some people don’t shut up when they should."
3069,It’s beautiful and suits your figure perfectly.
3070,Your boyfriend doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
3071,You’re boyfriend can shove it you look beautiful and you should only wear what you want!
3072,It looks gorgeous.
3073,Add a fine necklace to top it off and you are good for prom!
3074,I think it's lovely and it looks pretty on you.
3075,But your father said it would look good if just the bodice was lace.
3076,He too thought you looked lovely.
3077,Beautiful dress!
3078,That looks like such a fun dress to wear!
3079,"Enjoy your time with it, you look beautiful and there’s power in a great outfit."
3080,Own that power!
3081,"Your boyfriend can kick rocks, you enjoy the hell out of that dress."
3082,"A prom dress is supposed to be your dream dress, not your boyfriend's dream dress."
3083,"And if he's not your dream boyfriend, there is still time to find a better one for prom !"
3084,Holy crap.
3085,I love that dress and I am NOT saying that to make you feel better.
3086,It’s gorgeous.
3087,"I love the color, the pearls, the embroidery and the neckline is SO flattering and modest."
3088,"Just, wow."
3089,Side note.
3090,"I never once had a date or a boyfriend who ever said anything negative about what I was wearing, not ever."
3091,"My husband will tell me if he likes something or not if I ask him, but that’s it."
3092,No boyfriend worth his salt would say anything but the truth in this case:  YOU LOOK AMAZING!
3093,"(Whether or not he likes the dress, you are gorgeous in it)."
3094,"It’s not his dress, he doesn’t have to wear it, it’s not for him, it’s for you."
3095,"Please PLEASE don’t dress yourself to please others, especially men."
3096,"It is fine to take into consideration their opinions, their likes and dislikes, but ultimately it is your body, wear what you like, what makes you comfortable."
3097,"That said, I know my husband doesn’t like certain styles of clothes and prefers some colors than others, so I usually don’t buy anything he’d hate, but I’m never compromising what I like, what looks good on me, or what’s comfortable to appease his tastes or opinions."
3098,"He doesn’t like empire waists but he doesn’t have big boobs, a small waist, and a belly."
3099,So I wear them.
3100,"And he loves everything I put on, because it’s on me."
3101,It's gorgeous and it's YOUR dress!
3102,YOU will be wearing it!
3103,Not your bf.
3104,What the hecc do boys even know about dresses?
3105,Jk jk.
3106,"Jokes aside, this looks like the kinda dress I always dreamed of when I was in high school."
3107,We didn't have a prom though.
3108,"You'll look beautiful in it, trust me sis!"
3109,"I have a dress just like this, but in pink."
3110,I love it so much.
3111,Makes me feel like a Disney princess.
3112,It's a great choice of a dress and it fits you wonderfully!
3113,"It looks beautiful,  it fits so very well,,

3114,"Big, sis here:

Does the dress make /you/ happy?"
3115,Then wear it.
3116,Its a lovely color and it fits you well!
3117,Well it's a good thing he doesn't have to wear it then.
3118,I think it's gorgeous.
3119,I love the embroidery and the little side sleeve things.
3120,It's very elegant.
3121,You look like a princess.
3122,You should tell him that if he's going to complain you can go to prom without him.
3123,"Wat that dress is so gorgeous and elegant, it’s so subtle I love the colors and the neckline, boys are so dumb at that age or any age really, get a new date"
3124,It's beautiful!
3125,What a lovely shade of periwinkle/green.
3126,And it fits you well too!
3127,"Not everyone who has an opinion must be considered, if you liked it, go with it."
3128,Enjoy your prom!
3129,!
3130,OMG THAT’S GORGEOUS!!!
3131,!
3132,I'm not a mom I'm a brother..
3133,It looks so gorgeous your boyfriend is a dumb butt what you should have a boyfriend that compliments you.
3134,I also sang this message to you cause I drove
3135,Don't let other people talk you into hating something you love.
3136,It's a beautiful dress and you wear it with pride.
3137,"It's classy, beautiful and elegant just like you."
3138,A good boyfriend would be happy that you're happy.
3139,It is beautiful.
3140,The colour and lace are wonderful .
3141,And look how skinny it makes your waist!
3142,FYI after prom start looking for a new boyfriend .
3143,"Even if it was horrible which it is not, he should be telling you how beautiful you are."
3144,And when you see him in his tux be sure to tell him he looks like a “waiter”.
3145,"Oh darlin, that dress is lovely."
3146,"Don’t let anyone tell you what you can wear 

My granddaughter is wearing a tux to her prom."
3147,I don’t have a problem with that decision.
3148,BTW she’s straight
3149,"You don’t get many moments in life to wear amazing ball gowns, so when you get the chance, go all in!"
3150,You look amazing!
3151,That beading is just beautiful!
3152,"It's a gorgeous dress, a lovely spring color and fits you wonderfully!"
3153,You deserve a better boyfriend.
3154,"What's he planning to wear, jeans with holes in them?"
3155,"(Hint, he SHOULD be wearing a tux."
3156,Which he already should have scheduled the rental for.
3157,And ordered a WRIST corsage. )
3158,"I can't see your hair, but this is the time, if it's long, to wear it up, with only tendrils dangling..."
3159,"There won't be many opportunities for you to wear a dress like this, you bought it because it made you feel beautiful."
3160,"It makes you look beautiful as well, the colour compliments your skin tone well."
3161,Maybe try and keep your hairstyle a bit more simple as well as your shoes and bag.
3162,Let the dress be the star and make up to compliment the colours.
3163,You will look radiant I am sure.
3164,His jaw will drop when he sees the full picture on prom night.
3165,You will have many opportunities to play it safe with cocktail dress situations later in life.
3166,A dress like this needs a special night out and so do you!
3167,Sending you love through the cosmos!
3168,"And this is why there is a tradition of not showing the date, or the groom, your dress until the night of, when it’s too late for them to decide they have an opinion, and too late for them to feel comfortable saying anything except, “you look beautiful.”

I used to walk past a store on Sixth Ave. in Manhattan that had these incredible evening gowns, and I’d think, “I want the sort of life where I get to wear something like that now and then.” Because once you get to be an ordinary grownup, you aren’t attending red carpet events, usually."
3169,"It’s a lovely dress, with princess vibes."
3170,"Mix all prom attire convos with your boyfriend, and go find a tiara to wear."
3171,And a sparkly necklace that fits close to your neck.
3172,Sparkles on your shoes.
3173,Lean in to the princess vibes.
3174,It’s perfect!
3175,It’s beautiful and it fits you perfectly.
3176,Have the best time!
3177,!
3178,"your boyfriend can wear whatever dress he wants to prom, then."
3179,you look great.
3180,go have a good time at your dance.
3181,It looks gorgeous!
3182,And it fits you so well!
3183,"Nowadays nothing is too much for prom, only way something looks bad is if someone has a bad attitude."
3184,"This is your taste, and it looks beautiful!"
3185,"He should get a suit that compliments it, and you do your hair down with some waves and makeup, and you'll look like movie stars!"
3186,"A lot of supportive but toxic comments in this, jeez."
3187,"I know this is mom for a minute, and I'm a dad, but the boyfriend is in fact allowed to have an opinion about things he is a part of."
3188,"You're right, it's not just his prom, it's hers."
3189,"But, it's not *just* hers either."
3190,Come on.
3191,My girlfriend keeps buying gray clothes.
3192,I hate gray.
3193,"Gray clothing makes her look blahs and she looks much prettier in light blue or salmon, or olive green, and I tell her so."
3194,Should she dump me?
3195,We're not together or cancel our plans because of our opinions of the others clothing.
3196,Ridiculous.
3197,"If you had plans to go together before you bought the dress, I think it would have been best to collaborate before purchasing anything."
3198,It'll be a good lesson for the future.
3199,"That being said, it's apparent you love this dress and he will just have to suppress his negative feelings for it."
3200,"You'll have to be okay about his feelings, too."
3201,"Regardless, to answer your question, I like your dress and I think you'll both look nice at prom."
3202,It's a great night to be a little extra extravagant.
3203,I hope you guys can work out your feelings so you can have an awesome time.
3204,Good luck coming to peace and have fun!
3205,"I think the most important question here is,
How do you feel when you wear it?"
3206,Because nothing else matters.
3207,"If you feel beautiful and it boosts your confidence, then nothing else matters."
3208,I think you look stunning in it 💛
3209,Don’t you listen to him.
3210,Your gorgeous darling and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
3211,"It’s perfect, your stunning."
3212,Find a new boyfriend if he’s going to say things like that.
3213,It’s perfect just like you.
3214,I think you look like a Disney Princess.
3215,X
3216,"It's absolutely gorgeous, and perfectly appropriate for prom."
3217,Your boyfriend is wrong.
3218,"If you love it, wear it honey!"
3219,I love it you look like cinderella!
3220,"Do you have ""glass slippers"" to go with it?"
3221,It's beautiful!
3222,"You look like an ice fairy, or a calm spring sky."
3223,Tell your boyfriend to shush and if he doesn't like it he can take himself to prom.
3224,You're worth more than a mans shitty opinion 💙
3225,That dress is beautiful!
3226,What matters is how YOU feel in it.
3227,Don't let anyone make you feel bad about this dress.
3228,The only problem I have with it seems to be that your boyfriend doesn’t go with it.
3229,"I wonder if you could find a better match, or even go without if you need."
3230,I think it looks beautiful on you.
3231,"I love the off the shoulder, however can you remove the strap at the top?"
3232,Your boyfriend has bad taste in dresses but you have good taste haha.
3233,Why does he hate it?
3234,"I mean, my immediate assumption, and lord I hope I’m wrong, is that it’s not…revealing enough shall we say to put it nicely."
3235,This dress is extremely flattering on you.
3236,"The shoulders, the breast, the waist, the length of the skirt, all of it is on point."
3237,"Your bf needs to respect you, and if he doesn’t you need to find another boyfriend."
3238,Don’t sell yourself short.
3239,Sister here!!!
3240,This dress slaps!!!
3241,The sleeper have gorgeous detail.
3242,"The lace on the bodice blends into the dress in a wonderful way, and the color seems like a nice compliment to your complexion!"
3243,"Honestly, if your boyfriend feels like he has the right to hate it and think that you should have considered his feelings in regards to the dress, I’d be asking why."
3244,"The only thing that should be taken into account with him is color so that you two can match, and that’s only IF you guys decided you wanted to."
3245,"Everything else, he can shut up about for one night if you like it."
3246,"It’s a beautiful dress, and I hope prom is amazing for you!"
3247,P.s.
3248,saw a comment saying that he thought it wasn’t formal and was “too much for prom”  does he want you to wear a Bond Woman dress or something?
3249,"My senior prom dress was a pink between neon coral and hot pink, with a bedazzled bodice and in my memory it sticks out about three feet around my frame at all time."
3250,My sister’s senior prom dress was a corset top princess ball gown in lavender with purple roses on the waist.
3251,"My other sister’s dress is like an Elle woods special, skin tight and low cut with a slit up her side, sequined entirely in hot pink."
3252,There is no such thing as “too much” for prom
3253,"Oh honey, that dress looks amazing on you!"
3254,"The color compliments you, and I love the off the shoulders!"
3255,You will be absolutely stunning on prom night!
3256,Gorgeous!!
3257,!
3258,Well I guess it's good that he isn't the one who has to wear it!
3259,I love everything about this dress and I hope you still do too.
3260,"Your boyfriend's taste is all in his mouth, that dress is gorgeous and you look lovely."
3261,"Keep the dress, get rid of the boyfriend!"
3262,That dress is absolutely beautiful.
3263,"Babygirl, wear what makes you feel good."
3264,If he doesn't like it; I'm sure someone else would be more than happy to take beautiful you in that beautiful dress to the prom.
3265,Why does your boyfriend have any input on YOUR dress.
3266,"You wear it to prom, with or without him."
3267,Do you feel beautiful in it?
3268,Are you comfortable in it?
3269,Is this your “favorite” color?
3270,"If you said yes to any and all of these questions, then wear it!"
3271,Girls sense of style is much different than a boys.
3272,"As long as your like it, that’s most important."
3273,"And FWIW, I think you look great!"
3274,"Have fun at prom, kiddo 💗"
3275,This dress looks amazing on you and is gorgeous!
3276,Prom dresses are *meant* to be fancy.
3277,Does your boyfriend often make you feel bad about yourself and your choices?
3278,Because a good partner doesn't.
3279,Teen boys are not accurate judges of what makes formal wear appropriate or pretty.
3280,That dress looks stunning on you.
3281,"But never listen to a teen boy about this stuff, they have no clue."
3282,THAT COLOR IS STUNNING
3283,It’s lovely!
3284,"Maybe he doesn’t like it because it’s not super tight, low cut, with a huge slit all the way up to your crotch, and bright red?"
3285,🧐
3286,It’s beautiful!
3287,"Please just make sure you have the correct bra, and honey you are the one wearing the dress you look spectacular!👏👏👏🖤"
3288,That dress is gorgeous.
3289,"I mean, I'm old and I don't know what the kids are wearing to prom these days."
3290,But it's like that classic blue Cinderella vibe.
3291,And it fits you like a fairy godmother made it just for you.
3292,I really hope this boy doesn't ruin the prom for you.
3293,"If your boyfriend hates it, tell him not to wear it."
3294,I think you look like a princess!
3295,Tell him not to ruin your fucking nightb
3296,I’m not a mom but if you want a little brother to gas you up I love this dress.
3297,If you like it that’s all that matters.
3298,Not to mention I saw you say he thinks it’s too much.
3299,One of my homegirls literally showed up to prom in a wedding dress.
3300,If it makes you happy wear it.
3301,Because I love it.
3302,Take another gentleman instead!
3303,"If he don’t like it, he can kick rocks"
3304,It’s gorgeous and it looks amazing on you!
3305,"Besides, you will be the one wearing it, not him, sk he shouldn’t get to comment on it."
3306,"As long as _you_ feel comfortable and happy in the dress, that’s all that matters!"
3307,When you twirl around does it do the thing where the skirts fly out?
3308,"If so, does it make you feel like a princess going to the ball?"
3309,If answers to both questions are yes- wear the dress.
3310,fit for a princess and is suited for a queen
3311,This dress looks like the bad outcomes of an aliexpress delivery.
3312,Loving all the support you’re getting.
3313,If you wanted to try a bit of a Different look for the dress you could get a tailored.
3314,I could imagine removing the appliqué around the hips but leaving it on the bodice.
3315,And also removing the crinolines beneath the skirt so that lies flatter it has less of a ball gown shape.
3316,Wtf people getting so mad for him telling his honest opinion.
3317,"I am sick of this doctrine to always support anything your partner does as if it was the best idea ever, or otherwise you are an emotional monster."
3318,"Of course you should be kind even when ciriticizing, but this dress is of objectionable taste and he was just being honest."
3319,That is a valuable quality.
3320,"I love the shoulders, good find!"
3321,"Sweetie, you look lovely!"
3322,I think you have wonderful taste and it's a pity some people just aren't at your level yet.
3323,You picked something And it looks like a dream.
3324,Own it!
3325,It’s an awesome dress.
3326,Your bf needs to stop placing his insecurities on you.
3327,"If you feel it is too formal, you can always hem it to just below the knee and it would give off a retro vibe."
3328,Your boyfriend is a cunt.
3329,That dress is gorgeous.
3330,Go stag and enjoy your prom in your absolutely beautiful dress 😊
3331,Honey if you let that boy tell you how to dress and you pass on something that you love and feel comfortable in you will regret it.
3332,I didn’t even go because my bf at the time didn’t want to and wouldn’t let me go with friends.
3333,You do you!
3334,If he doesn’t like it then is he really worth it?
3335,It’s a beautiful unique dress and fits you like a glove.
3336,It’s concerning that he would say that to you.
3337,"It’s unkind, controlling and objectifying."
3338,He has caused you to doubt your decisions and your own beauty.
3339,Oh sweet heart it’s gorgeous!!!
3340,You look like a princess!
3341,Ditch the boy.
3342,He doesn’t sound very nice.
3343,You deserve better than him.
3344,"I love the lace detailing so so much, and such a pretty colour too!"
3345,"omg, please wear this beautiful dress!"
3346,"Everyone else said everything that needs to be said, but just please wear this dress when given the opportunity."
3347,It's gorgeous!
3348,"You have great taste, Sib."
3349,It is a lovely dress and a lovely colour.
3350,"And more importantly, you look super nice in it, apart from comfortable."
3351,I hope your boyfriend comes around.
3352,"If he doesn’t, his loss."
3353,Have fun at prom baby girl!
3354,Stay safe and take lots of pictures 😍❤️
3355,"Your dress is lovely, elegant, and flattering!"
3356,"I think you made a great choice and it's a shame that your bf is ""yucking on your yum""."
3357,Does he tend to do that?
3358,Rain on your parade?
3359,Because that's toxic and unhealthy for you.
3360,ITS BEAUTIFUL FUCK WHAT HE THINKS
3361,Go to prom with your friends and have fun.
3362,The dress is gorgeous on you.
3363,I bet you’ll go to the prom and meet someone who will fall in love with you in that dress.
3364,Stunning!
3365,you bf is wrong.
3366,it looks very nice
3367,This is one of the few times you can wear a dress like this.
3368,Rock it!
3369,It's gorgeous!!
3370,He can respectfully get over himself.
3371,He should be focused on you and not the dress.
3372,What?
3373,"I’m not a mom, but as a dude this looks gorgeous."
3374,The dress is absolutely beautiful and so elegant.
3375,The boyfriend on the other hand should have kept his thoughts to himself.
3376,everyone has different taste and different expections.
3377,what matters is that you are happy with the situation.
3378,a lot of times two people have different expections on a shared experience.
3379,"while you think it is beautiful , it is, he might see it as over the top."
3380,i personally see this as a difference in preference.
3381,all in all i hope you enjoy your prom.
3382,Baby that dress is gorgeous.
3383,Your boyfriend is being a dick.
3384,Can I give you a piece of advice?
3385,"When I was going to my senior prom, I fell in love with a purple corset dress."
3386,My figure looked incredible.
3387,But my boyfriend wanted to wear a red tie and black suit.
3388,So I bought a red dress.
3389,"It looked the worst on me out of all the dresses I tried, but he liked red and I wanted him to think I was sexy."
3390,I still regret it all these years later.
3391,He eventually ghosted me after 9 years together and married someone else.
3392,Don't make the same mistake I did.
3393,Wear what you love.
3394,And consider going by yourself or with a new date if your boyfriend doesn't shape up
3395,Obviously the boyfriend’s parents didn’t explain the situation.
3396,"It’s one of the few nights for the girls to dress up like a Princess, no questions asked."
3397,The dress is beautiful.
3398,The boyfriend needs serious relationship coaching.
3399,Love the dress not the boyfriend
3400,Dad for a minute checking in.
3401,Your dress is nice and the color is great.
3402,Tell your boyfriend to get on board and make the night fun or he can take his mom to prom.
3403,The dress is great.
3404,Do you have enough time to pick out a new date though?
3405,Honorary sister here: your BF is lying to you.
3406,That dress is beautiful and suits you perfectly!
3407,The colour is amazing against your skin tone.
3408,What?!?!
3409,What on earth does he not like about it??
3410,I think it’s truly beautiful and I’m not just trying to be kind.
3411,I love the pattern and I REALLY love the color and beading !
3412,Have you asked him to give you something specific about it that he doesn’t like?
3413,"If he doesn’t like it, tell him to go to Lowe’s or Home Depot, either is fine, and tell him to get some nails, a hammer and some wood."
3414,Then tell him to build a bridge and get the fuck over it.
3415,You look stunning.
3416,Please don't let anyone make you question choices of taste.
3417,You are perfectly capable of choosing what you like.
3418,"If you can remember that, it can protect you from losing the person who matters most: yourself."
3419,I'm not a mom but that's gorgeous and if you were my daughter I would cry happy tears seeing you in it.
3420,That dress is beautiful and fits you like a glove.
3421,You look amazing!!
3422,Your boyfriend doesn’t deserve to stand next to all this gorgeous at prom.
3423,Can I be DadForAMinute?
3424,"I love that dress, it's classy, beautiful, and I love the color."
3425,It's probably easier to return the boyfriend then the dress!
3426,"Enjoy the prom, in that dress please."
3427,Your boyfriend sucks
3428,"I’m just a Dad, but for what it’s worth, I think it’s gorgeous."
3429,Especially the color.
3430,The dress is good.
3431,The people talking shit are the problem.
3432,Wtf would he say that.
3433,I would have worn this dress in my wedding
3434,"Coming from /r/all, I just want to say it's not necessarily the dress that makes the dress beautiful, it's who is wearing the dress that makes it beautiful."
3435,I'm a Dad that just stumbled on this.
3436,Echoing exactly what all the Mom's are saying.
3437,"You and the dress are beautiful, rethink the boyfriend not the dress."
3438,Your dress is beautiful.
3439,"Your time is far too valuable to be spent with unsupportive people, especially at important events like prom."
3440,Ditch your boyfriend and wear your beautiful dress to prom with your friends.
3441,Have a wonderful time.
3442,"Be safe, call an Uber if you need one."
3443,"No judgement from mom, long as you get home safely."
3444,Dad for a minute here.
3445,My prom was absolutely atrocious because I thought it was supposed to be a super romantic affair with someone important.
3446,Wrong.
3447,It’s a celebration of the coming of age of you and your friends.
3448,"If you feel amazing and love the dress, that is what matters."
3449,Go out!
3450,Feel beautiful!
3451,Have a great time with your friends and those that love you!
3452,Get pictures!
3453,Dance a lot!
3454,Bring flats!
3455,"Love ya, kiddo!"
3456,It's beautiful.
3457,And what's most important is how you feel in it.
3458,"If you like it, then wear it!"
3459,"Oh, honey."
3460,You look like a princess!
3461,It's gorgeous!
3462,Ditch that jerk and go on your own.
3463,Maybe you'll meet a prince.
3464,"Honey, it looks gorgeous, really."
3465,Please wear this!
3466,"I'm a mid-20s dude from the front page so I'm not a great mom, but maybe a guy's opinion will give some perspective."
3467,I really like the dress!
3468,"The color is a really nice choice, not too flashy, but not boring."
3469,All the detailing is really pretty too.
3470,"You did a good job, it's perfect for prom"
3471,Dress is freaking amazing!
3472,Your bf can suck a fart out of my ass.
3473,That dress is gorgeous and perfect for prom.
3474,Wear it and don't look back.
3475,Sib here.
3476,That dress is amazing on you.
3477,Your boyfriend is wrong.
3478,You look so beautiful and the design suits you.
3479,That is a gorgeous dress.
3480,Absolutely stunning.
3481,You look beautiful and the color is exquisite!
3482,Dump the boyfriend.
3483,You kind of look like a princess
3484,It looks like a Cinderella dress!
3485,It's very flattering to your figure!!
3486,"But you should wear what makes you happy on your prom day, OP...."
3487,"I bought my daughter 2 prom dresses so she had one and a backup, just in case...."
3488,I wish I could do the same for you!
3489,I love the style and the color.
3490,"If you spent a lot of money on it, I'm sure you didn't choose it in haste, and really loved it when you made the decision to purchase it."
3491,Never let anyone else tell you something you love is not nice/pretty/enjoyable/etc.
3492,"It is a lovely dress, looks beautiful on your frame, I love the floral embellishments, the color is a beautiful shade that I've never really seen on a prom dress."
3493,"It is unique, and gorgeous."
3494,"It's lovely, and it fits you perfectly."
3495,It might be worth having a heart-to-heart with the boyfriend about how he is making you feel over his critique of the dress.
3496,"Surely, in the long run, how you feel is far more important than the color or cut of a dress?"
3497,"Baby girl, you look absolutely stunning in that dress!!!!"
3498,"In my experience, people who decide to bring you down instead of up, are not worth your time."
3499,"You’re young and have so much life ahead of you—focus on what you want, what you need, and your dreams because 20 years from now, they likely won’t be in your life anymore but the choices you make now can and could affect you for the rest of your life."
3500,Long story short.
3501,"The dress is beautiful and your boyfriend should make you feel good about yourself, not questioning yourself."
3502,It's fine.
3503,Also it's prom.
3504,It's a big deal to you but overall even if it wasn't a nice dress it's not going to matter 10 years from now.
3505,Or even 2.
3506,The point of it is to enjoy yourself.
3507,"The dress compliments your figure, is an ok neutral color (it shouldn't really be black or white which it's not but also who cares even if it was so it's fine), and has some basic embroidery that really accentuates it while not being too much."
3508,"This is honestly nicer than it needs to be

Like it's a perfectly nice dress."
3509,Your boyfriend perhaps is insecure about prom?
3510,Or if he did this often he just might not be very nice.
3511,Ether way think about it
3512,Dad here.
3513,It is lovely.
3514,"If he can’t see that you look your best in a dress that you like, then he cannot appreciate the beauty that you have inside and out."
3515,You can do better
3516,No regrets darling.
3517,"Keep the dress and get a boyfriend who understands that, as long as you're happy and healthy, his opinion of your body and style should be ""if you like, I like it""."
3518,"If you can ditch the boy and go to prom with your bffs instead, you'll probably have a better time anyway."
3519,I know I did.
3520,This dress is gorgeous!
3521,I stopped scrolling to look at it closer because it’s so pretty.
3522,Had never even heard of this sub and was confused for a minute until I read your caption.
3523,"Seriously, it’s beautiful."
3524,This dress is gorgeous and it looks so beautiful on you!
3525,"Tell your boyfriend when he’s wearing a dress to prom, he can pick that one"
3526,"I will not lie to you—it isn’t what my high school would have considered prom attire (I come from the South and everything is weird here), but I LOVE it."
3527,"The fit, the color, the embroidery… wow."
3528,Tell your boyfriend to get over himself.
3529,What the fuck is wrong with your boyfriend?
3530,No honey you look like Cinderella and it’s not your boyfriends call.
3531,Embrace the fact that you look like a character from a fairy tale!
3532,"This is your magical night and the boyfriend can suck it up - he’ll love the dress once he sees the way you light up wearing it, that’s all that should count 💕"
3533,Ill be honest.
3534,The dress is pretty good!
3535,"Like when I looked at it I thought ""oh that's quite nice actually."""
3536,Guessing your boyfriend was expecting one of those bland SL fit dresses that shows off more of your lower figure.
3537,That's the general trend these days.
3538,Of course that's just my assumlption.
3539,"In any case, your boyfriend has the wrong expectations."
3540,That's ok we all have our expectations.
3541,"What's wrong is that he is chiding you for the dress, saying it's ugly."
3542,Nothings wrong with honest opinion but he is showing a lack of care or candour.
3543,"Basically, it sounds like your boyfriend has some maturing to do"
3544,If he doesn’t like your dress then he can wear one he likes to prom.
3545,"Your boyfriends issue is that if you wear that, he wont be able to wear his metallica t=shirt and 3 week unwashed jeans, and he may have to clean his teeth, seriously, you look awesome, he should be proud to have you on his arm in that but obviously he is a lazy arsed dick who thinks "" if she wears that, she will look great, which means i have to make an effort- i dont like making an effort"", wear the dress, ditch the guy, you will eventually anyway."
3546,i’ve never met a good boyfriend with strong opinions on dresses.
3547,Dress is lovely.
3548,Bf is a jerk.
3549,It's an lovely dress and I think it compliments your shape well.
3550,Tell your boyfriend he's an idiot lol.
3551,I keep looking at your picture and wondering what could possibly be wrong with this beautiful dress.
3552,"The color is stunning on you, the cut is fantastic for your shape."
3553,The style is lovely.
3554,YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
3555,I don't think there are any problems with the dress whatsoever.
3556,I do think there is a problem with anybody who thinks there is a problem with the dress- full stop.
3557,Don't let other people doubt your own worth.
3558,"I hope you have a wonderful time at the dance, with whomever you choose to be with."
3559,What?!
3560,"Your boyfriend is an idiot, you look like a princess."
3561,Like I'm legit jealous I want your dress
3562,You look gorgeous and will have a stunning night.
3563,I agree that your boyfriend may be in awe at how amazing you look but if that is his pattern then I would look hard at where your life will go with him.
3564,You are beautiful and worthy of great things.
3565,Now go and get them.
3566,"If he truly respects you, he would support your choice of dress and the happiness it gives you."
3567,I mean it's not like there's anything about this dress that a reasonable person could find offensive.
3568,So what is his problem?
3569,It’s elegant but it does look a little bit like a wedding dress.
3570,Maybe that’s what scared him lol
3571,This is beautiful
3572,"Ehhh.. (pokes dad head from behind newspaper)

Get a new boyfriend

(resumes paper)"
3573,As a previous high school boy and now father - fuck that kid.
3574,He can wear a dress that he likes then.
3575,Do you.
3576,Be you.
3577,Be happy!
3578,Not a mom and I’m sorry for breaking the rules.
3579,I’m a 20 year old dude but I think it’s a gorgeous dress.
3580,He should feel honored to take you out in it.
3581,"Yes, it's really that bad."
3582,".
.
.
.
.
.
Not the dress, the boyfriend.....get rid of him"
3583,it's beautiful.
3584,your boyfriend is wrong.
3585,Find a new prom date.
3586,It’s beautiful!
3587,"Prom is not a “casual” thing, love!"
3588,"You’re supposed to go all out and look like a Hollywood star, which you’re doing perfectly!"
3589,"It sounds as though he thinks you’ll look out of his league (which you already are, but as we know a man’s ego is very fragile)."
3590,"If you want to wear it, which I think you should, don’t let a stupid man tell you not to."
3591,"It’s beautiful and it’s YOU, and if he doesn’t like it he can go find another prom date."
3592,This fits you great and is so classy.
3593,The colour is sweet too.
3594,Ditch that boy-he’s no good for you.
3595,Well I don't think I like that boyfriend very much.
3596,Sounds like an absolute fool!
3597,It's a beautiful dress for a beautiful person.
3598,"That is a gorgeous color,  and the beadwork is stunning!"
3599,I'm looking forward to the prom pics
3600,you look absolutely gorgeous!
3601,it’s a great dress.
3602,and honestly your boyfriend can get lost.
3603,he’s supposed to be on your team and cheering you on.
3604,Your dress is beautiful and your boyfriend's a jerk.
3605,"Curious - why does he ""hate"" it?"
3606,"Girl that dress is sick, and it fits you like a glove."
3607,You look gorgeous!
3608,"(Ps don’t trust your bf on fashion, most men are in over their head there."
3609,And at that age I’d guess his fashion experience is what t-shirt to wear with his jeans and sneakers everyday)
3610,"Not a mom, but I can be a virtual older sister… my input?"
3611,You look like a modern Cinderella.
3612,"I love the detail, the color, and the neckline."
3613,It has such a classic and unique look as well and fits nicely!
3614,Boys at that age are not too bright.
3615,But never date a boy who makes you feel insecure.
3616,Take it from someone who has made that mistake many times over.
3617,"It’s not worth it, esp when there are guys out there who will make you feel like the most beautiful woman around."
3618,I promise you that.
3619,That fit is perfection!I think the style is lovely and uique.
3620,The BF tho 😒
3621,"Go with that dress to the prom even for us girls not living where proms are organized, because we would love a dress like that"
3622,"It is a well fitting, beautiful dress."
3623,"If you truly don’t like it, that is one thing."
3624,"But if you don’t like it just because he doesn’t, then take a breath and realize it looks amazing on you and you chose well!"
3625,This is a classic look that will be easy to move and have fun in at Prom.
3626,Not to mention the color compliments your skin tone well 💜💜
3627,It's gorgeous and it's not like he's wearing it!
3628,"Keep the dress, drop the boyfriend"
3629,It’s a beautiful dress that looks great on you honey
3630,Your boyfriend knows nothing about dresses.
3631,Maybe dump him after the prom.
3632,Maybe at the prom.
3633,You and the dress are fabulous!
3634,"Babe, it’s giving Cinderella vibes and that’s my favorite princess."
3635,That dress is beautiful and your boyfriend can respectfully stfu.
3636,Do you need a date?
3637,We will find you a Prince Charming.
3638,Let’s gooooo
3639,"It’s beautiful, it’s almost identical to my prom dress and I got tons of compliments."
3640,You will too.
3641,Your bf is crazy for thinking that.
3642,Could you sell me that?
3643,"Here’s a little secret I didn’t know in high school, but wish I did: all outfits are like 90% confidence and comfort."
3644,"If you feel comfortable, you’ll look comfortable, which will in turn make your prom photos stand the test of time."
3645,"Put it on and stand in front of a mirror, admire how it looks on you."
3646,Check out all your best angles and note all the all the details you fell in love with when you first put it on and decided it was the One.
3647,Dance around like you’re Mia Thermopolis at her ball and admire how the skirt swishes around you.
3648,"If it makes you feel beautiful, it’s the right dress for you."
3649,I don't think it's bad at all.
3650,I just think you should change the boyfriend you have.
3651,He shouldn't make you feel this way.
3652,"Your dress is beautiful, and looks wonderful on you."
3653,A boyfriend who tears you down is not worth your time.
3654,Surround yourself with people who life you up.
3655,"There is a difference between letting someone know if there is an issue with clothing or helping to pick out or style an outfit when asked, and being mean or critical to hurt someone."
3656,Which is he really doing?
3657,You do need something new: a new boyfriend.
3658,That dress looks AMAZING on you!
3659,I don't like it
3660,I'll  give it a 6/10
3661,"You’re not a fairy princess, I can understand his disliking it."
3662,Also f$&k all these people shitting on your boyfriend for his honest opinion.
3663,"Seems like people want you to date a liar, reddit is full of foolish people who want an idealized man"
3664,"I'm sorry, but I don't think it's a nice dress."
3665,It seems old fashioned and gaudy.
3666,Why should your boyfriend lie to you?
3667,He has a right to his opinion.
3668,"If he loves you, it won't matter that he hates the dress-- but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a right to an opinion."
3669,"For example, my husband loves me and how I look, but if I wear something a little much, he might say something."
3670,"I not his opinion, but whether I actually change or not is up to myself."
3671,"Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't."
3672,"And once I choose to continue to wear it, he might drop it or he might tease a little, but it's all in good fun and I know he doesn't really care that much."
3673,"At the end of the day, do what makes you happy."
3674,Fashion is subjective so of course some will like it and some won't.
3675,"And btw, personally, I would appreciate if my boyfriend felt comfortable to communicate w me."
3676,As long as it doesn't become a pattern of him hating your clothes; at that point he just may not be compatible with you.
3677,I agree with what all the other moms are saying.
3678,I think a string of pearls and matching drop earrings would be the perfect accessories
3679,"It is…

But if its what makes you happy and the money given, do what you do ig"
3680,So you posted this what to feign needing advice just so you could compliment farm?
3681,Btw the dress is how ever good you decide to feel in it.
3682,It does look more like a bridesmaid dress
3683,You kidding?
3684,That dress is gorgeous!!
3685,"You look like a princess, madam 🤗🤗🤗💙💙💙"
3686,Lol people need to stop coming to reddit just to hear the opposite what they’re suppose to hear.
3687,You got the most liked comment talking as if the boyfriend is the problem.
3688,The problem is you came to reddit for advice
3689,Looks grandma-y and something To wear to a ball back in the 1800s
3690,Fabulous prom dress and it looks so great with your skin tone!
3691,"Ditch the boyfriend sweetie, no one gets to choose what you wear except you and no one should cause you to second guess what makes you feel beautiful."
3692,You look amazing!
3693,I think it’s beautiful!
3694,What doesn’t he like about it?
3695,Can he be specific or does he just not like it?
3696,Love it!
3697,That dress is beautiful!
3698,I'm getting Cinderella vibes and I love it!
3699,"I second everything everyone above said, on endless repeat!"
3700,"Sis, you look stunning!"
3701,"the color looks so nice on your skin tone, its flattering and it's a great dress for prom!"
3702,Does he see how extra other girls are at homecoming with all the glam?
3703,prom is no different.
3704,"Enjoy your night, wear that gorgeous dress, and be the disney princess you have always wanted to be (if that's something you did want)"
3705,You look like Cinderella!!!
3706,I love your dress
3707,It makes you look like a princess.
3708,Prom is one of those rare moments in life where you get to look like a princess for an evening if that's what you want to do.
3709,Rock your princess look young lady!
3710,It’s so *pretty*!
3711,"Unless your bf is a Fashion Diva, he doesn’t get to tell you that it’s “too much for prom”!"
3712,Has he *seen* some of the prom dresses out there‽
3713,The dress is very pretty and unique.
3714,"Just wear it proud and if he has a problem with it, I hope that his attitude shows you who he really is."
3715,"It's such an elegant, classy and pretty dress."
3716,You look great in it.
3717,Wear the dress and rock it.
3718,Be true to yourself.
3719,Prom is the one time you can really glam up as a teen outside of an opera.
3720,"You look beautiful, so put your shoulders back and keep your head high!"
3721,Gorgeous and perfect for a prom.
3722,"Not overstated, but not boring."
3723,"It's fabulous and you have great taste (in dresses, but perhaps not in boyfriends..."
3724,Your boyfriend's lack of self confidence should not translate into trying to pull you down.
3725,He needs to allow you to pull him up.
3726,"And he doesn't understand, even remotely, what prom is all about...)"
3727,That’s gorgeous!!!
3728,Color is beautiful and it fits so well.
3729,"It’s fine he doesn’t like it, because everyone has different tastes but it’s definitely a win!"
3730,You look like a princess!
3731,I think it’s perfect.
3732,Maybe he sees it more as a wedding dress and it makes HIM uncomfortable.
3733,Doesn’t mean u should exchange it.
3734,It’s beautiful and u have good taste.
3735,"It looks beautiful on you, sis!"
3736,"He's not the one wearing the dress, so he can shut his face hole."
3737,you will know the answer 5-10 years from now when you randomly think of this while taking a shower or about to sleep.
3738,You look like a winter forest fairy... all icey pine trees and magical!!!
3739,It fits you really well and looks really good on you!
3740,Don't listen him.
3741,It's a nice dress.
3742,Enjoy your prom.
3743,"Some days I wish I had attended mine, but that's long ago now."
3744,That boy doesn't deserve you.
3745,You look stunning and if he doesn't think so then you can find someone who does!
3746,It's unique and interesting and flattering.
3747,You made a wonderful decision.
3748,I love it so much I'm already styling it in my head with pearl accessories and wondering what shoes you'll be wearing.
3749,"That is beautiful, elegant and totally a colour I'd wear."
3750,"Make sure you choose good foundation underwear, this is a step people often skip but can make all the difference to the overall silhouette."
3751,I think its gorgeous!
3752,"Wear it with pride, baby girl"
3753,I feel like you’re Cinderella!!!
3754,"Your boyfriend is unkind, is he like this a lot or is this new?"
3755,Red flag.
3756,It’s beautiful!
3757,Reminds me of Cinderella’s dress.
3758,"If you like it, that’s all that matters."
3759,sweetie there is literally nothing bad about the dress.
3760,"the beading is beautiful, and it’s so elegant."
3761,"my prom dress was very similar and i love it, and still have it, to this day."
3762,you look beautiful.
3763,"if anything i think your boyfriend maybe, just maybe, isn’t the best authority on womens fashion."
3764,also he’s simply wrong  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3765,That is a beautiful dress!
3766,I hope you have fun at prom.
3767,"And don’t let your boyfriend get you down, he may not actually hate the dress but may be worried that because you look so beautiful in it that other boys will try to flirt with you."
3768,And if he does actually not like it then tell him to close his trap because it’s your dress that you love and that’s all that matters especially if he didn’t help pay for it or come with you to pick it out.
3769,"From someone who sews: the bodice fits you so well, and that is so hard to achieve when you’re shopping ready-to-wear!"
3770,I think it shows that you have a good eye for what suits you.
3771,"Also, I normally don’t dig the prom dress thing (I‘m not American and i prefer a plainer style), but this is really not too much -   and the color helps to keep it classy."
3772,Your boyfriend can shove it.
3773,"Keep the dress, hun and dump the boy."
3774,The dress is beautiful and it makes you feel good which is important !
3775,The thing that isn’t making you feel good is the boy.
3776,I wore a dress that was “cool” rather than the one I loved (no boy involved just peer pressure).
3777,Now I can’t even look at the photos cos the dress sucked.
3778,Hope you have a wonderful prom!
3779,This is your sister speaking.
3780,"That dress is gorgeous, and doubly so on you!"
3781,Can you imagine ever saying that kind of thing to him?
3782,"Does he often criticize your choices (that don't affect him at all, btw)?"
3783,"Tell him to be happy that you're happy, and if he can't meet you there, then you have the green light to find another date to prom."
3784,"Enjoy yourself, sis!"
3785,OMGOSH!!
3786,IT IS BEAUTIFUL!!!!
3787,That color is perfect against your skin tone and the fit is so flattering!
3788,I love it!
3789,It’s absolutely beautiful.
3790,"He has no taste, you look so good in it !"
3791,!
3792,What?!
3793,Is he blind?
3794,That looks stunning on you!
3795,The color really complements you and that fit is 🔥 my girl!
3796,"He can shove his opinion up his butt, especially if it makes YOU feel good :)"
3797,It’s the best floofy dress ever !
3798,I wore a neon orange giant ball gown for my first prom back in the day.
3799,Don’t listen to him and enjoy the dress 😌
3800,Looks beautiful!
3801,If someone told my daughter they hated their dress I am not sure they would deserve her.
3802,"Keep the dress, ditch the boyfriend."
3803,This is gorgeous and I suspect he wants you to wear something more revealing.
3804,"You wear the dress you live and have a great time, even if it means ditching him."
3805,Its so beautiful!!
3806,"&#x200B;

Maybe consider dropping the boyfriend & his negative heart?"
3807,It’s gorgeous!
3808,Don’t listen to bf
3809,That dress is lovely!
3810,"keep the dress, dump the boyfriend if he keeps saying its' not."
3811,OMG I love it!
3812,You look amazing.
3813,Too much for prom?
3814,Is he planning on wearing a t-shirt???
3815,This is a BEAUTIFUL dress.
3816,Your boyfriend needs to take a chill pill.
3817,"Dear sis, someone literally wore a vintage lace wedding gown to my prom, while someone else wore a tulle tutu and low top Converse."
3818,"Your boyfriend doesn’t have to be a fairy prince just because you’re living your best fairytale life, and you can just take pictures separately if he’s going to be a horse’s rear end about it."
3819,That's a beautiful and classy dress.
3820,It fits you FABULOUSLY.
3821,Your BF can shove it.
3822,It's one of those dresses that could be passed down within families.
3823,"It's gorgeous, love."
3824,I love it.
3825,What’s to hate?
3826,What?
3827,"It's a beautiful dress (and honestly not ""not classy enough or whatever) and if your bf doesn’t like it, you should tell him that he is free to wear the dress of his choice."
3828,"I'm sorry, WHAT???"
3829,That's a wonderful prom dress: design and fit wise!!!
3830,You chose it for a reason (and I'm glad you did!).
3831,"It's pretty overwhelming to be met with negative opinions ab your clothes esp for an important event, but in the end it's up to you."
3832,That's why I love online shopping too lol.
3833,Also your bf is kinda totally unsupportive and seems too invested in what you choose to wear 😒
3834,"I think it’s beautiful, little one, and it fits you perfectly."
3835,Very flattering.
3836,"It's gorgeous and from the pictures you posted, it fits superbly!"
3837,That colour looks stunning on you!
3838,It looks like it fits perfectly and the design is gorgeous.
3839,"It isn't down to him tbh he won't be wearing it, it's about how it makes you feel in the dress."
3840,"I think it looks beautiful on you

I hope you have an amazing time at prom 😊"
3841,I love it.
3842,"<3 

Maybe he is nervous about dressing formally to match?"
3843,I’m so into this dress and how it fits you!
3844,It's a Cinderella dream!
3845,"I hope you feel as beautiful in it at prom as you did when you first tried it on (and ignore the boyfriend, you're young enough that either he'll either get over it or you'll get over him)"
3846,It’s gorgeous - the only thing inappropriate for prom is this boyfriend.
3847,Go with a group of girlfriends if possible and have a blast!
3848,"That dress is gorgeous, and very similar to my daughter's (the ballroom style with embroidery)."
3849,You are totally rocking it in the pictures too.
3850,Prom is the perfect event for this dress.
3851,"Do whatever makes you happiest, but it sounds like your dude is bringing you down."
3852,https://imgur.com/a/rSmLuNT
3853,"Stunningly beautiful, you look like Cinderella <3"
3854,This is giving me Bridgerton vibes and I’m here for it.
3855,I regret not being extra for my prom.
3856,It's gorgeous!!
3857,!
3858,It looks great!
3859,Wear it and have a blast 💥
3860,"It’s so beautiful and unique, just like you."
3861,Your boyfriend would do well to keep his opinions to himself - it’s YOUR dress and YOUR choice.
3862,I think you look stunning.
3863,Have fun at prom sweetheart!
3864,"I used to work in a prom dress store, so I can say without a doubt that this in no way ""too much for prom."""
3865,I've seen dresses with cut outs.
3866,$1000 dresses.
3867,Dresses that poofed out 6 inches from the wearers sides and required petticoats.
3868,The color matches your skin tone marvelously.
3869,And the fit is gorgeous.
3870,It's elegant and literally looks like a dress out of a fairy tale.
3871,Older sister chiming in.
3872,"Honey bee, that dress looks beautiful, and you are wearing that dress, the dress isn't wearing you!"
3873,Aka- you look amazing!
3874,"Also, when are you ever going to get the chance to wear it again?"
3875,"(Although, I could definitely see it turned into a calf-length dress for fancy parties in the future, like a 50s-era housewife dress.)"
3876,Prom is absolutely the time to celebrate yourself and to wear pretty/ fancy clothes.
3877,The only other time you'd get the chance is if/ when you get married.
3878,You need to remind yourself what it felt like when you put it on.
3879,Remember how you felt and how you imagined yourself going to prom in that dress.
3880,Don't let your boyfriend ruin the moment for you.
3881,He should be lifting you up.
3882,"And if he has a differing opinion, tell him he can take it up with me."
3883,"With lots of love, Older Sis."
3884,"I think it’s beautiful, and it looks spectacular on you."
3885,"I’m sorry your boyfriend is being like that, ug."
3886,"As your internet mom-for-a-minute, I want you to totally enjoy your prom!!!"
3887,Have fun and enjoy being beautiful and fancy!!
3888,!
3889,But… that dress is dope!
3890,That dress is beautiful!
3891,Tell your boyfriend to shut the hell up.
3892,The only thing out of his mouth should be “you look beautiful!” He didn’t pay for it so screw him!
3893,That is easily one of the most beautiful prom dresses I have ever seen.
3894,I would have absolutely chosen one like it for myself.
3895,You look like a princess!
3896,Oh my dear - don't let that tasteless boyfriend discourage you.
3897,There are no other occasions in life other than your wedding day to look like a princess.
3898,Wear.
3899,That.
3900,Fairytale.
3901,Dress.
3902,You look amazing and I really wish I would have worn a beautiful princess dress to my prom!!
3903,!
3904,It's beautiful!
3905,All that matters is that you love it!
3906,I love it!!
3907,!- your sister!
3908,!
3909,It’s a beautiful dress and it looks like it fits you really good.
3910,It looks really nice on you
3911,That is such a beautiful dress😀 seriously!
3912,Who cares if your boyfriend hates it?
3913,He’s not the one wearing it!
3914,Are you comfortable in it?
3915,Can you breathe and move ok in it?
3916,Does it make you feel like a million dollars?
3917,Because you certainly look a million dollars in it😀 maybe you need another prom date who will lift you up instead of bringing you down.
3918,Whatever happens- I hope you have a truly wonderful prom xxx
3919,It's beautiful and fits you very well!
3920,It's beautiful!!
3921,You look beautiful x
3922,That is an absolutely gorgeous dress!
3923,I love that you look like a lady in it!
3924,Very classy!
3925,"I see too many girls in tight tight, short short dresses, and they look nasty."
3926,Don’t take advice from a teenage boy that knows very little about the world.
3927,Prettiest dress ever!!
3928,!
3929,That is a beautiful dress and it fits you so well.
3930,I'm wondering about boyfriend though.
3931,"He's made his point, now he can shut up."
3932,Your dress is amazing!
3933,You have great taste and don't anyone tell you otherwise.
3934,I think it is beautiful!
3935,This is beautiful!
3936,If you like it wear it.
3937,"If **you** like it, and it makes you feel pretty to wear it, then it’s the right dress for your big day."
3938,Hey kiddo.
3939,I wore a fluffy prom dress that other people said I would regret.
3940,"It was bright lime green, and looked exactly like a Tinkerbell dress only it was floor length."
3941,I didn't regret it.
3942,I ROCKED that dress.
3943,A decade plus later I love it more than I did then!!
3944,WEAR THE DRESS!
3945,"The memories of wearing this grass will last forever, this boy obviously won't 

This dress is classic, elegant, and timeless."
3946,You're not going to look back a decade from now and say why the fuck was I wearing that like some of your classmates will!!
3947,Love mama
3948,"Dude it looks beautiful, reminds me of Cinderella."
3949,Like what her fairy godmother would make from the scraps of her hand sewn/critter assisted sewn dress.
3950,"I love the color and the beading down the front, if you really want, rip those hanging sleeves off the sides and leave the straps up top for stability, this will modernize it further."
3951,Great dress!
3952,Terrible boyfriend!
3953,"Oh my goodness, this dress is so lovely."
3954,You're going to look great at prom!
3955,It's a lovely dress and couldn't fit any better!
3956,The color is great with your skin!
3957,Remember how happy you were when you found it?
3958,Go back to the moment you put it on and how it felt and hold on to that joy!
3959,That is an absolutely gorgeous dress and from what I can see you look beautiful in it.
3960,"So what if your boyfriend doesn’t like it, you should dress for yourself not others!"
3961,You have great taste in dresses now go to the prom and have an amazing time!
3962,This dress looks beautiful on you.
3963,It fits you so well.
3964,Women can wear what they choose to wear.
3965,Men do not own our bodies.
3966,Like others have said you rarely get to wear these pretty dresses in life.
3967,Prom and wedding.
3968,Wear the dress and have a good time.
3969,It’s not appropriate to say what I did at my proms and after.
3970,Lol
3971,"Sweetie, that dress is STUNNING on you!"
3972,It compliments your complexion and is such a unique and bold color.
3973,"It’s absolutely gorgeous, and, as a small pro tip, if you love it enough, save it for your wedding."
3974,That’s what I did.
3975,"You’ll save a TON more money, and unless you’re very traditional, you do not HAVE to have a white dress for a wedding."
3976,"Also, ask yourself if YOU love the dress?"
3977,My prom dress made me feel like the woman I had become when I was normally (and still am) very “Tom boyish”.
3978,"If you FEEL great and you LOVE that dress, then own it!"
3979,"Be all of the you that you want to be, because you don’t get many chances to just have fun and be beautiful."
3980,"Also, tell your boyfriend he should work on his emotional intelligence."
3981,"Sib, that dress is so cute!!!"
3982,I genuinely love it
3983,Gorgeous!!
3984,I love the flower/beading so much!
3985,It also looks like it fits you great.
3986,"Ignore him, you picked a wonderful dress!"
3987,It’s great!
3988,Tell him he can buy you a different one if he doesn’t like it.
3989,It’s gorgeous and fits you beautifully.
3990,Very flattering and I love the vibe.
3991,Don’t let him ruin it for you.
3992,Story time!
3993,"For my prom, I bought an $800 wedding dress for $80 because it had no train."
3994,"I wore that dress to prom, and nobody said a word."
3995,Your boyfriend is wrong for trying to police how you dress.
3996,I think it's perfect for prom!
3997,It’s absolutely stunning!!
3998,Your bf is cuckoo 😛
3999,"Sweetie, this dress is gorgeous and you look like a princess!"
4000,"Your boyfriend, on the other hand, you may need to return to the boyfriend store because it sounds like you got a bad one 😉"
4001,You look like you a princess!
4002,I wish my prom dress had been this beautiful.
4003,You look amazing.
4004,You’re boyfriend is more than likely upset because he thinks you’ll look better than him at the prom.
4005,Some high school boys have a complex and want to feel superior to their partners.
4006,Take this from a mom who had a boyfriend just like this in high school.
4007,Do not let him make you hate your absolutely amazing dress.
4008,That dress is amazing!!
4009,!

4017,"That dress looks absolutely gorgeous on you, the color is amazing, and the lace is just pulling your glamor all together."
4018,"That boy can get his opinions out all he wants, but this is not his decision."
4019,Prom is supposed to be a time for you to have fun and dress up.
4020,"In my opinion, go all out and get some glittery jewelry from Icing (or equivalent) to finish the look."
4021,Be a princess.
4022,A Queen.
4023,Be fabulous!
4024,This Internet stranger thinks it’s pretty
4025,Not my kinda style but it looks ok lol why does he hate it?
4026,"If you are still struggling with this, you can cut it short (a seamstress can) which could make it seem more high school- I think it’s gorgeous as is, but your boyfriend is thinking about the body hugging less fluffy trend."
4027,Yours is classy and fits you perfectly!
4028,Be happy with your own dress- my mom and sister (who has opposite tastes from me) picked out my dress on a trip to the states.
4029,Hated it and looked bad in it.
4030,You like yours and look good in it-  much better way to remember your prom.
4031,Good luck on your decision!
4032,Absolutely stunning.
4033,It suits you so much!
4034,I like it!
4035,"The color, the fit."
4036,"If you feel good in it, don’t worry about what anyone else thinks."
4037,"Hi little sis, as someone who wore a poofy princess dress to prom - you will LOVE that you got the chance to do this when you are older."
4038,I still have mine and wish I could wear it again!
4039,You look like a princess!
4040,I hope you have a wonderful time with your friends at prom and make a lot of memories!
4041,🖤

4050,❤️
4051,"Oh my gosh, you look like a mermaid!"
4052,Your dress is glorious and fits you beautifully.

4076,!
4077,"Keep the dress, return the boyfriend!"

4089,It's beautiful and it's perfect for prom.
4090,There are very few days in our lives when we get to wear beautiful ballgowns and this is absolutely one of them.
4091,"It also looks like it fits you perfectly, if I'm being honest I think he's being an asshole and very inappropriate and unsupportive."
4092,You don't have to put up with that.
4093,"I think it’s stunning, both in color and poofiness"
4094,Sweetie pea that dress is fairytale vibes all day!
4095,This sleeves/straps are so cute.
4096,It looks like it fits you so great too.
4097,I'm 95% sure if you accidentally tear it or something singing cartoon mice will appear and mend it.
4098,Don't get too freaked out when the cartoon birds bring you a floral crown to wear with it.
4099,In all seriousness though prom is the go crazy/over the top high school dance.
4100,If you don't go over the top now when will you?
4101,No matter what you choose I hope you have an awesome time at prom!
4102,"Keep the dress, ditch the boyfriend"
4103,Don't ever give a partner permission to make you feel less than confident!

4113,"I’m not just saying that to be nice either, I imagine when you put that dress on and looked in the mirror you must have felt so happy and beautiful in it."
4114,"Remember that feeling and own it, tell your bf how it made you feel, if he still says the same thing, wear the damn dress anyway."
4115,It’s lovely.

4133,Change your mind about going with him.
4134,Know you look incredible and have a great night.
4135,I have to be a nag and say this.
4136,"Him harping on you about what you’re wearing to prom, shows me he’s inconsiderate and a little mean."

4154,And you look beautiful.
4155,Your boyfriend needs to learn.
4156,"Everything my wife puts effort to and is proud to wear looks fantastic, whether it actually does or not."
4157,It’s so easy to just give someone an ego boost rather than bum them out.
4158,He hasn’t learned this yet.
4159,The dress looks great - wear it and enjoy it.
4160,The dress is a nice design.
4161,This tradition is tired as hell.

4195,Why doesn’t he like the color?
4196,Not his top choice?
4197,Fine tough luck.
4198,Did he want to match ties to your dress?
4199,Well he can wear silver/gray/black.
4200,I think this tone of blue isn’t going to limit his choices a ton.
4201,How did you feel when you tried it on and bought it?
4202,Amazing?
4203,Then remember that.
4204,"If your boyfriend can’t put his opinions aside and tell you look beautiful at prom, then group up with your best friends and dance the night away, sis!"

4206,"First off, that dress looks and fits you beautifully!"

4222,"You go, girl!"
4223,Xx
4224,Did you feel unsure about this dress before your boyfriend was critical?
4225,"If the answer is “yes,” then you might want to think about this boy."
4226,"Feeling insecure is part of being a teenager, but spending time with someone who makes you feel insecure isn’t healthy."
4227,"Maybe he was feeling anxious about prom, but that’s no reason to be critical of your choice."
4228,Friends and boyfriends should lift you up.
4229,I love your dress!

4237,That dress is beautiful.
4238,"There is no such thing as ""too much for prom""!"
4239,It's beautiful and you look amazing!
4240,I would ask your boyfriend to point out something he likes -- maybe he's hoping you'll go in lingerie or something;-(
4241,I love your dress.
4242,It's beautiful!
4243,Looking back I wish I would have gone more extravagant for prom.
4244,It's totally giving Cinderella vibes!
4245,!
4246,"Its gorgeous, I love the colour."
4247,What shoes are you going to wear with it?
4248,"I never had a prom, but if i had thats a dress i would dream to wear."
4249,And it looks so good on you too!
4250,It looks like it fits perfectly from the pictures.
4251,"You shouldn't let others choose for you on your day, its a one of a time occasion!"
4252,"You need to feel good and pretty about yourself, not let others feel pretty for you."

4254,That is so gorgeous!

4262,It’s beautiful and looks great one you :)
4263,It’s beautiful
4264,"Hi, I have grown up and got educated somewhere where the concept or idea of prom or even something similar did not exist."
4265,But I have lived in places and have had enough friends to completely understand the high emotions surrounding prom.
4266,"So firstly, you are really lucky that you are going to prom."
4267,Tell that to yourself at least inside your head because it is really true.
4268,You are very lucky that you are getting to go to prom.
4269,"Secondly, this is a once-in-a-lifetime event and you just want to feel good and have fun, right?"
4270,"Trust me, once the big day kicks off, all that's really going to matter is whether you're having feel-good fun and bonding with folks whom you want to remember for a long time, and the good moments of this day is going to linger in your memories even when you grow old."
4271,"As long as you're feeling good and beautiful in whatever you want to wear, the dress seriously should not matter or even figure anywhere in determining whether you're going to have a blast."
4272,You're going to rock that dress and you're going to have a blast.
4273,Period.
4274,Boyfriends or friends or anybody who tries to pull your confidence down: it's time to show them that they don't matter in the long run.
4275,Your memories of this day are the only ones you're going to carry with yourself for the rest of your life from this prom.
4276,Even the dress can get old or torn but the memory remains; so it's their loss if they don't want to be a part of that positive experience.
4277,your dress is perfect.
4278,your boyfriend is not.
4279,politely tell him youll be happy to go to prom alone or with your girlfriends if he has that much of an issue and if he does then dump him like a sack of potatoes.
4280,your partner should always support you especially with your style/appearance.
4281,I really like it....
4282,The problems not the dress kiddo.
4283,It’s the boyfriend.
4284,Hey sis!
4285,"First of all, your dress is gorgeous and you are beautiful."
4286,"Second of all, if he doesn’t like it, he doesn’t have to be the one wearing it."
4287,I’m so sorry he made you feel like you made the wrong choice.
4288,Take it from someone who is working on not being a serial people-pleaser: Your happiness is worth more than his opinions.
4289,"If this dress makes you happy, then wear it."
4290,your bf is a douche; you look stunning
4291,"It looks beautiful, honey."
4292,He maybe a bit anxious himself and is just projecting it on you?
4293,"Besides, what do most guys know about dresses!"
4294,Don’t forget to take lots of pictures.
4295,Be safe ❤️ have fun!
4296,I love this dress.
4297,Coming from someone who normally doesn’t like “prom dresses”.
4298,"Looks great on you, too."
4299,Holy shit it’s beautiful!
4300,You look so great in it!
4301,"I had a similar style myself (ball gown with beading/embroidery at top) but mine didn’t have those sleeves, I wish it did."
4302,It was my favorite dress of all time and I don’t regret it years later.
4303,"Tell your bf it’s your choice, have him match with a baby blue tie."
4304,- Resident Older Sis
4305,You look like a princess!
4306,Tell him to Prince Charming it up!💖
4307,That dress is gorgeous!
4308,It's worth every penny you spent on it and it looks amazing on you!
4309,You should wear that dress with all the confidence in the world.
4310,He should be proud to have you by his side at prom.
4311,It's the perfect dress for prom!
4312,"Tell him to find his own dress to wear then

Nah, you look great though; it gives elegant Cinderella vibes."
4313,I also love the off the shoulder sleeves!!
4314,"This is why boyfriends don’t wear dresses, cause they clearly have no taste."
4315,"You literally look like a princess, if your bf doesnt like it theres literally anyone else at your school that would feel lucky to take you 💙"
4316,It’s beautiful honey.
4317,Fits you and looks lovely!
4318,My prom dress was a bit expensive but I got a lot of use afterwards at other events.
4319,"And even if you don’t, you love it, I love it, it’s yours and not his."
4320,I wore a dress like this to prom!
4321,Nobody liked it either but I didn’t care because I just really wanted to wear a big ol dress.
4322,All the other girls were dressed hella slutty and hot… then there was me lol but I don’t regret it at all 18 years later.
4323,"If your bf wants simple, let him go find simple!"
4324,"Pshaw, the boy has no taste."
4325,"This dress is perfect, fits you like a glove, and it screems prom."
4326,"He's probably embarrassed he didn't plan a better outfit and is bound to look more like your manservant than your prince, but alas, it's his own fault, isn't it?"
4327,"Honey, your dress is beautiful but I'm afraid you chose the wrong boyfriend."
4328,"A boy who adores you will think the handmade dress you made out of duct tape is perfect, or the fanciest, floofiest, most ridiculous confection ever seen is perfect."
4329,Because you are perfection in it.
4330,Have a fabulous time with your friends and wear whatever makes you feel magical.
4331,"It’s beautiful, you picked it for a reason."
4332,It must’ve spoke to you.
4333,I think it is a gorgeous dress and fits you lovely.
4334,I wish I had wore something like this at my prom.
4335,I wore something simple and I regret not using that moment to wear a princess dress.
4336,"This dress is beautiful, and it fits you so well!"
4337,The color suits you too!
4338,Where did you find this dress?
4339,I honestly wish I could have gotten married in it!!!
4340,What do your friends think about the dress?
4341,"I wore a dress like this, As did my sister."
4342,Best decision ever.
4343,I’m 24 now and you don’t get the chance to wear them often.
4344,It’s beautiful and elegant.
4345,No one should ever tell you what you can and can’t wear.
4346,Wear it proud and have fun!!
4347,!
4348,"Dear daughter, I was mindlessly scrolling and stopped dead in my tracks at this post SPECIFICALLY to goggle over this dress."
4349,Imagine my surprise to see this lovely young lady was you!
4350,"I can imagine your joy in finding it, the dress, the perfect prom dress of your dreams!"
4351,"It's an amazing moment in a young woman's life, and I don't usually talk like that as you know lol but your boring old mom still remembers the day she found that black velvet princess seamed gown and how spectacular it felt."
4352,it felt like joy and beauty and dreams and youth.
4353,So your post broke my heart and you should never ever feel like this.
4354,He shattered your beautiful confidence and peed all over your joy.
4355,"as your mother, I say with great sincerity, fuck that guy."
4356,"Maybe he's young and dumb, maybe he's just a jerk, but until he can learn to be proud of being with such a beautiful young woman, he doesn't deserve to be."
4357,"go with a friend, go with your dog, go with me… But you go in that dress and you find your smile again."
4358,i wonder if the ….tendrils are bothering him ?
4359,"it seems like it would be more youthful without those, if they could be removed."
4360,Opinion from this man is that is a very pretty and tasteful dress.
4361,He is a fool.
4362,You look fantastic!
4363,People wear all kinds of styles to prom.
4364,It's your chance to express your fantasy style.
4365,"You have a lifetime to do the little black dress thing if you want, but few chances to REALLY get dolled up."
4366,"If your boyfriend can't be happy you found a dress you love, ditch him and go with a friend."
4367,"You deserve fun, not criticism."
4368,This prom dress is FAR from bad- I absolutely LOVE it!
4369,In fact I was mindlessly scrolling through Reddit & the dress stopped me in my tracks.
4370,"Have fun, look FABULOUS, & enjoy your prom!"
4371,❤️
4372,You look absolutely stunning :)
4373,Your boyfriend's a dick that dress is gorgeous and suits you very well.
4374,Hell I would get married in that dress.
4375,Plus he isn't wearing it so he doesn't get an opinion
4376,"That is one of the loveliest dresses I've ever seen for prom, truly elegant and it flatters you!"
4377,"The dress and the beauty is for you, Dear, not for him."
4378,"Really, if he can't appreciate what a gorgeous choice you've made, then go single and enjoy the night like you planned - without complaints!"
4379,:)
4380,"Enby sib here, but I think it’s really fucking cute and your boyfriend should shut up"
4381,It's beautiful!
4382,You're like cinderella!!
4383,!
4384,"Not a mom, but I sister."
4385,But that dress is amazing!
4386,It looks so pretty on you.
4387,It gives me Cinderella vibes!
4388,"I read one of your comments and if he thinks it’s too much, he should see mine."
4389,Mine had 80% more sparkle and on it.
4390,"If you are happy with it, keep it."
4391,As you can keep the dress and it will keep the memories with it
4392,It's really beautiful and you look great.
4393,"Maybe you boyfriend thinks you look ""too prety"" and is insecure?"
4394,"Dear, you deserve someone that looks at you like you are the moon and  the stars."
4395,"Honey, you look like a Disney princess!"
4396,"Wear the dress, ignore what your boyfriend says, and have a great time!"
4397,You're going to be the belle of the ball.
4398,You look like Cinderella!
4399,"If you like it and feel confident, then screw what he thinks."
4400,I think you look gorgeous 😍
4401,It’s gorgeous!
4402,It looks good to me.
4403,"If it looked like shit, I wouldn't say anything at all, but I honestly don't see anything wrong with it."
4404,Maybe you need a better bf to go with the dress.
4405,You look like a princess!
4406,I love that dress!
4407,I hope you get your hair and nails done too and have a great time in that dress!
4408,With or without the boyfriend.
4409,Your boyfriend has terrible taste.
4410,It looks amazing!
4411,It's *GORGEOUS.
4412,*
4413,That dress is just gorgeous.
4414,I wish I had something that pretty when I went to prom.
4415,You look like a princess.
4416,Enjoy your prom in that dress!
4417,You look absolutely beautiful.
4418,Don’t change a thing.
4419,"Oh sweetie, your boyfriend needs a reality check."
4420,This is your dress and if he claims to care for you he should be building you up not criticizing your choice.
4421,"It’s easy for me to say here, but I’ll say it anyway…remember you don’t need a date to go to prom!"
4422,You can go and rock that beautiful dress while having a blast with friends.
4423,Take care of you!
4424,I love your dress.
4425,It’s a beautiful color and looks great on you!
4426,"Not a mom but that’s just how prom dresses look, it looks nice"
4427,I like it.
4428,If you like it.
4429,Wear it.
4430,Let no man tell you what you should like.
4431,I think it’s gorgeous!
4432,"The dress is absolutely gorgeous, exactly the sort of dress I would feel like a princess in too."
4433,"Your boyfriend isn’t wearing it, it doesn’t affect him."
4434,So why does he feel the need to criticise/control if you like the dress he should be happy that you are happy.
4435,He is a red flag.
4436,What will he criticise about you next?
4437,Your hair?
4438,Your makeup?
4439,Your friends?
4440,Your career?
4441,"Etc etc

Keep the dress and trade in the boyfriend for someone more supportive and more kind and loving."
4442,Someone who isn’t giving off red flags.
4443,"Someone who cares about enhancing your happiness, lifting you up and is proud to have you by their side in any clothes you feel comfortable in."
4444,BTW your boyfriend should always love it.
4445,He should not be putting doubts in your mind about your choices.
4446,I think it looks beautiful and I love the color.
4447,Keep the dress and ditch the date.
4448,"My first thought when I saw the picture before even reading the title was, ""That dress is really pretty!"""
4449,Enjoy your prom and feel like a princess for a day.
4450,You rarely have opportunities to dress up like that outside of weddings and proms.
4451,Very pretty.
4452,"Please make sure you get a photo of yourself, solo in it, so you can remember the night you looked like a million bucks."
4453,The dress is mesmerising..
4454,!!
4455,Wear it and tell him to respect ur choice
4456,It’s beautiful.
4457,I love the design with the trailing flowers.
4458,I think keep the dress and dump the guy.
4459,Whose he to tell you what to wear.
4460,"fk your boyfriend, you are gorgeous and you deserve SO much better."
4461,"he’s projecting his insecurities onto you and you’re so young you have a bright future ahead of you without people like that dragging you down

trust me he won’t be around in 10 years."
4462,"do what makes you happy

dump him."
4463,take your best friend to prom.
4464,you’ll thank yourself when you’re older
4465,That is beautiful and reminds me of Belle from Beauty and the Beast.
4466,I’m mostly regretting your boyfriend.
4467,no way!
4468,the floofier the better.
4469,i always wanted to wear a princess looking gown to prom - and now at 24 i regret not going bigger lol 🤣 one comment i totally agree with - you only ever get to wear things like that to prom and your own wedding.
4470,go big big big!!!!
4471,!
4472,It looks so elegant!
4473,I love it
4474,You look like an actual princess
4475,That is an absolutely GORGEOUS princess dress!!
4476,"If he doesn't like it, he can wear something else; but I think you look amazing in it."
4477,😍😍
4478,It is classy!
4479,I really love the detail along the sleeve cap thingies.
4480,"Very 1950's esque, sophisticated and lovely!"
4481,"If you love it, it would be nice if he liked it because it makes you happy."
4482,"Either way, have fun at Prom dear!"
4483,It’s princessy.
4484,He probably expected slutty.
4485,Not a mom but a sister.
4486,Ask yourself “Do I love this dress and how it looks on me?
4487,"Do I feel like a Queen/princess?” 

If the answer is yes, then fuck him."
4488,The men in our lives do not dictate the clothes we wear.
4489,I really love that ball gown and prom is the absolute perfect opportunity to wear it.
4490,Also the color is lovely and it suits you well.
4491,The top sleeves are very much in fashion right now and the beaded accents are a nice touch.
4492,I thought I was on another sub when I saw your dress.
4493,I screamed - out loud - Where did they find that dress?!?
4494,It’s gorgeous!!
4495,Then I saw the title.
4496,You did great picking out that dress.
4497,Looks fantastic.
4498,"Tell your boyfriend, “It makes me happy."
4499,I love it and I am wearing it.” Any answer other than a positive one is grounds for going with friends or finding another date.
4500,It's beautiful.
4501,Your BF is a douche bag.
4502,I also have fonder memories of my dress and not my date.
4503,"It’s beautiful, if you let him pick your dress it’ll be something you will hate and regret."
4504,Watch how many compliments you get.
4505,"Oh yeah, im sure your boyfriend has years of experience and knowledge in fashion design."
4506,The dress is fine if you like it.
4507,I think it’s so beautiful!
4508,The only question that matters is.
4509,Do you like it?
4510,Because that's the only opinion that matters.
4511,I love it!
4512,"Blue, and all colors in that shade, make me incredibly happy so I might be biased lol but I think it’s flattering and just the right amount of “flair”.."
4513,"I agree with previous commenters that prom is one of the best times to wear a floofy, princess dress… I hope you have the best time at prom!"
4514,"It's not my style but it's a beautyful dress, it gives me forest fairy vibes, I don't get why your bf hates it but in any case it's YOUR dress, you are the one wearing it so the only one that has to like it is YOU."
4515,Too much for prom?
4516,Young women will literally wear crystal encrusted dresses….
4517,"I think you’re good in dusty blue… 
Side note, I love that you are wearing a more princessy style."
4518,"When you get older you realize that prom is one of the few occasions it’s appropriate to wear a dress like that unless you want to wear a princess dress to your wedding, and on that day many women was to look more mature."
4519,I think you’ll be happy when you look back
4520,🥹🥺you look so beautiful
4521,"The dress is gorgeous, and fits you super well!"
4522,"You’ll look amazing in it, and maybe you can get him to get a matching tie and pocket square or lapel flower, it would look great!"
4523,"No way, you look like Cinderella!"
4524,I think it’s beautiful!
4525,"Gorgeous dress, dumb boyfriend"
4526,Keep the dress baby.
4527,Lose the boyfriend.
4528,This dress is AMAZING!
4529,It is the PERFECT Prom dress!
4530,You look absolutely beautiful in this dress!
4531,"The color, style and detailing are perfect for you!"
4532,Not going to give you crap about the boyfriend.
4533,He is young and has not figured out when to shut his mouth yet.
4534,Enjoy your prom and do not let him bring you down.
4535,You look absolutely amazing!!
4536,!
4537,I think it’s beautiful and I love how unique it is!
4538,If you love the dress and makes you happy wear the dress 💕
4539,It might not be his style but you look like a princess.
4540,"If you love the dress, wear your dress"
4541,You look lovely!!!
4542,This looks like a terrific prom dress!
4543,The color is gorgeous too!!!
4544,💜
4545,What?
4546,"You look like a princess, it's absolutely gorgeous and I'm a little jealous."
4547,Why would your boyfriend not see that you're gorgeous in this dress?
4548,"Please tell me he isn't such an asshole in day to day life, life's too short to be with someone who puts you down."
4549,Especially since he's so wrong too.
4550,"The dress looks lovely, and the colour is really nice."
4551,"Don’t second guess yourself, it’s perfect for your prom."
4552,<3
4553,That color looks great with your skin tone.
4554,And the form is very flattering.
4555,"If you love it, wear it!"
4556,And like someone else said get a solo picture!
4557,"It’s a beautiful and appropriate dress for prom, wear that one!"
4558,It's beautiful ❤️ you look like a princess.
4559,"If you love it, wear it!"
4560,There are only a few days in your life where you get to wear fancy dresses.
4561,Prom and your wedding day are usually it.
4562,Wear what you want.
4563,Don't second guess yourself.
4564,Enjoy your prom.
4565,He's just upset cause he knows you're going to be stealing the show from him.
4566,He wanted you in something simple so he could shine.
4567,Don't let someone else smother your shine sis.
4568,Shine on!
4569,And that dress is bitchin' and I don't even like dresses.
4570,Edit: a word
4571,Keep the dress.
4572,Ditch the boyfriend.
4573,"It's bold and lovely, your boyfriend is a cunt"
4574,That dress is gorgeous!
4575,"It's such a fun, yet elegant color, and the beading is so fancy."
4576,And the off the shoulder style suits you very well.
4577,"Whatever issues he has with that amazing dress are his problem, not yours."
4578,"I can't play armchair psych here, but all I can say is that it's not your job to please him, nor is it his job to be so critical."
4579,"If he's going to be so negative about it, let his lack of fun on prom night be completely on his own shoulders."
4580,"Own your night, with or without him!"
4581,WHAT!!???
4582,Omg that dress is effing gorgeous.
4583,I’d have killed to have a dress that beautiful at my prom.
4584,"Like other Moms here have commented, boyfriends come and go - this one will!"
4585,But beautiful dresses and nights when we feel like princesses happen so rarely you have to savor it.
4586,"Do not regret the money, if you independently love this dress outside of his useless opinion, do not hesitate!"
4587,"He gets no say, his job is to buy you a beautiful corsage and dance with you."
4588,"Funny fact: I loved my junior prom dress so much I still have it, 20 years later."
4589,It is hanging in my closet!
4590,I wore it once but I will love that dress until the day I die and no one will ever touch it.
4591,"That dress is formal, elegant, and you look like a modern-day Cinderella!"
4592,"If anything changes to your prom plans, i vote it should be your date."
4593,"First off, love the username, second off love the dress."
4594,It fits your figure perfectly.
4595,Too much for Prom!?
4596,Dresses like this are mostly made literally FOR prom!
4597,Looks like a beautiful prom dress to me.
4598,"Baby it’s such an elegant dress, and very quite beautiful!"
4599,It looks lovely on you.
4600,"Wtf does he want you to wear, a hoe dress?"
4601,A friend of mine at our prom (‘15) literally came in a massive pink princess dress.
4602,It took her and her now husband over 30mins just to get her in the car to come to the venue.
4603,"I’m sorry he feels that way, maybe discussing why you chose it and how beautiful you feel in it will convince him to suck it up?"
4604,"Wear what you love, get a new boyfriend if you need to!"
4605,saw this dress and LITERALLY gasped out loud.
4606,it's beautiful and you look stunning in it!
4607,"i'm sorry your boyfriend isn't jazzed, but when it comes down to it, if you love it, and if you feel confident and beautiful, that's all he should care about."
4608,"if he wants to wear a different dress, let him know the good shops lol"
4609,you look absolutely gorgeous!
4610,!
4611,This is just a starter bf right?
4612,So his opinion is invalid and unimportant.
4613,But it's a good example of idiot crap you'll have to put up with from males as you get older and continue dating.
4614,Stand up for yourself now with this minor junk so you have the habits and skills to stand up for yourself in more important situations later on in life.
4615,Enjoy your prom and your dress.
4616,You only get one.
4617,It's beautiful.
4618,He has no idea what he's talking about.
4619,That dress is absolutely GORGEOUS on you and I think it’s perfect for prom.
4620,"From one sister to another, forget him and wear what you love."
4621,❤️
4622,It is absolutely beautiful!
4623,You should wear it and own it!
4624,"Like others said, other than prom and your wedding, you’ll not have many other opportunities to dress like a princess so you should enjoy it!"
4625,"If your boyfriend doesn’t like it, he can go by himself!"
4626,Edited: for spelling
4627,"Sweetie, do you feel beautiful in it?"
4628,That’s all that matters.
4629,And it’ll definitely contribute to having a good time.
4630,I think you’ll look beautiful no matter what you wear!
4631,"Your boyfriend should, too."
4632,But it’s what YOU think that matters.
4633,Dad here: the dress is great and you look lovely.
4634,"Now, please send you boyfriend in here so I can have a that with that little shit."
4635,"Angel, this is gorgeous."
4636,You look beautiful in this dress.
4637,What if it's too much for a prom?
4638,"It's your prom, YOUR special day, you deserve to be as extra as you want after going through all those years of classes."
4639,"You do you, be proud of yourself!"
4640,It's a gorgeous dress with beautiful details.
4641,"I've learned growing up that there aren't many opportunities to wear such beautiful dresses, but prom is definitely one!"
4642,you look stunning hun!
4643,and the colour is lovely!
4644,"trust yourself, you made the right choice ❤"
4645,That dress is stunning.
4646,It fits you so nicely.
4647,You look like a princess!
4648,It is GORGEOUS.
4649,Tell your boyfriend to get over it.
4650,I like it
4651,Love the dress.
4652,Maybe the only thing I would add is maybe a necklace or some pearls or something with similar beading or the same seafoam color.
4653,"Also, are those shoulder straps or hanger straps?"
4654,"Love,
Mom"
4655,"Hey OP, teenage boys can be really dumb."
4656,The dress is beautiful and it looks lovely.
4657,"A good rule of thumb I use for picking out outfits is that if it makes me feel happy and pretty, then it’s a good outfit."
4658,And this is a great outfit :)
4659,You look like a princess!
4660,There were several people at my senior prom who wore ball gowns like this.
4661,I wish I could’ve!
4662,Enjoy the dance and tell your boyfriend to kick rocks.
4663,"He’s not wearing it, so he doesn’t get a say."
4664,The dress is beautiful!
4665,Add some killer earrings and bracelet and a dainty necklace and slay!!!
4666,"As for your bf, he is not the one wearing it."
4667,He can pound sand.
4668,That’s a rockin’ prom dress!!
4669,It’s PROM.
4670,Not a Sunday brunch 😏
4671,"Oh honey it’s gorgeous, especially those sleeves!!"
4672,"Your dress is gorgeous, and you should rock it."
4673,He can shove it.
4674,"I was boredly  browsing through reddit, saw the pic without reading the title and my immediate thought was ""what a beautiful dress!"""
4675,"Who cares if he hates it, you be you."
4676,You have excellent taste
4677,"I wore an 1870s replica ballgown to my senior prom, complete with crinoline."
4678,This is an absolutely beautiful dress and perfectly appropriate for prom.
4679,"I think your boyfriend is on the boat that prom dresses are supposed to look like red carpet dresses, which has been the trend for the last maybe 10 years."
4680,And while that's definitely a valid way to dress for prom it's not the *only* way.
4681,"Disregarding outside input, how does wearing the dress make you feel?"
4682,Do you feel beautiful?
4683,Does it inspire your face to bloom into a sunny smile?
4684,Because that's what really matters: how something you wear makes you feel.
4685,Anyone who loves you would want nothing more than to see you dance with all you spirit.
4686,I'm sorry that your boyfriend hasn't matured enough to realize this.
4687,"It's hard, but how he's handled this matter thus far begs addressing."
4688,"And about the dress, I trust you to make the best decision."
4689,"For what it's worth, I think you look gorgeous in it."
4690,If you like it why should it matter what others think?
4691,Its your time to shine.
4692,Honey it's beautiful dress and the color suits you so well.
4693,It's your prom and you can go out as much as you want.
4694,Your boyfriend shouldn't make you feel bad he should encourage you and make you feel better.
4695,"End of the day you are wearing and not him, be confident and continue to be a beautiful young lady."
4696,I absolutely love the color and it’s very flattering to you.
4697,It's beautiful sweetheart
4698,Are you kidding me?
4699,You look like Cinderella in that dress!
4700,It's beautiful.
4701,And it fits you so well!
4702,Wear it!
4703,Don't let him get in your head.
4704,Sis you look GORGEOUS and that dress is to die for!!
4705,So mad we don't get prom in the UK so you take this opportunity to wear this beautiful dress and tell your bf that he has no taste whatsoever and if he prefers boring not-so-fancy school dances he should go to school in the UK.
4706,"You live your Fairy tale princess dream on your prom night, girl, you're gonna have the best dress there."
4707,"Love, your big sis."
4708,❤
4709,"Yeah, you're rocking that dress."
4710,"My guess is he isn't used to seeing you dressed like that and therefore it's ""weird"" to him."
4711,You rock that dress and he can shut up about it.
4712,I think it looks beautiful!
4713,Go forth and be that princess you deserve to be!
4714,Oh my goodness honey this might be the most gorgeous dress I've ever seen and you are exactly the right body type for it.
4715,Throw the whole man out
4716,"I would decide honestly if he is a nice person, and if you decide he is not than return him but keep the dress."
4717,"Either way, keep the dress."
4718,It looks beautiful on you.
4719,I think it’s absolutely beautiful and the most important thing is - do YOU love it?
4720,That’s the most important thing.
4721,"If your bf doesn’t like it, then he needs to get over it and be more open-minded."
4722,Wear it - you don’t get much chances in life to wear such a beautiful dress!
4723,You do YOU.
4724,GO FOR IT.
4725,XX
4726,"First thing first, do you like it?"
4727,It's amazing and you look beautiful and if you feel comfortable in it that's all that matters 💙💙
4728,Sister here....your dress is absolutely stunning!!!!!!!!!
4729,Don't you for a second think he is right.
4730,You wear what you want and not what he likes.
4731,It's lovely!
4732,Is he afraid of you showing him up?
4733,Tell him to get a suit.
4734,I think it's a lovely princess type dress.
4735,You look fabulous and very regal.
4736,I'm so proud of you.
4737,What does your boyfriend want?
4738,Something hoochie?
4739,Tell him to have a seat.
4740,It’s gorgeous and you look so beautiful in it.
4741,"Keep the dress❤️, return the bf 🤨"
4742,"Hello darling - 
The dress is beautiful as are you."
4743,"Stand firm in your choice, hold your head high and tell the bf to start working on matching flowers & attire!!!"
4744,"Love,
Mom"
4745,I can’t see the length - but I think it’s just right for prom
4746,It’s beautiful!
4747,I wore a similarly “fancy” dress to prom and everybody else wore simpler stuff; I got compliments all night and other people said they were jealous.
4748,:P Your boyfriend is being silly.
4749,It’s one of the few chances you’ll get to wear a lovely gown.
4750,CHOOSE THE DRESS YOU LOVE!
4751,your bf can pick his own dress to wear if it’s that important to him.
4752,You need a new boyfriend.
4753,If you love it that should mean something to him.
4754,"Hi OP, the dress is gorgeous, you’ll look lovely for prom and I’m sure you’ll have a fantastic night…with or without your boyfriend."
4755,"Talking about your boyfriend, maybe reflect a little about how he makes you feel and if he’s maybe a good fit for you."
4756,Does he judge your appearance a lot?
4757,Does he make you feel bad about yourself at all?
4758,Do you feel better about yourself when you’re not with him?
4759,Do you try to shape yourself to *his* image of what you should look like?
4760,Try and figure out if this is the person you want in your life.
4761,Hope you’re okay OP xx
4762,"Babe, all I'm gonna say is that I had an idea for a perfect dress for 10 years now and this dress looks almost exactly like it!"
4763,Your man is blind if he doesn't like it.
4764,"The important thing is that you like it and it looks amazing on you so wear it, honey!"
4765,!
4766,I’m so sorry he said that to you!
4767,I would be so upset.
4768,It’s really a beautiful dress!
4769,If you feel great in it stuff him!
4770,The dress is not the problem
4771,I think it’s very pretty!
4772,"""I'm starting to think he's right."""
4773,That right there tells me he's controlling and a manipulator.
4774,"Your dress is stunning, dump that creep"
4775,Fits well and is beautiful.
4776,You're boyfriend probably just wants something more revealing and has no idea what actually looks best on you.
4777,That's a beautiful and flattering dress and he's just wrong.
4778,Which happens.
4779,But you rock that thing!
4780,What?
4781,This is gorgeous.
4782,Also not enthusiastic that your BF would say that….
4783,Not very kind.
4784,I think it's stunning but the only opinion that matters is yours.
4785,If you love it wear it don't let other people dictate your life.
4786,I think it it looks gorgeous!

4796,Beautiful dress.
4797,"Hunny, he doesn't know what he's talking about!"
4798,That dress is beautiful!
4799,A good dress you can wear for years or put up and save for a daughter maybe.
4800,But boys are a dime a dozen and if he had any brain cells he would only think about how fabulous you look instead of disliking the color.
4801,Dump him and dance your little heart out at the prom
4802,This is resplendent and ravishing.
4803,I’m sorry his words have started to steal your joy.
4804,"The first thing that caught my eye was the dress because it’s so beautiful, then I looked at the subreddit."
4805,Enjoy yourself and explain to you boyfriend that he needs to jump on the bandwagon and show some support!
4806,That dress is gorgeous and your boyfriend is blind.
4807,I think you should drop an easy 150 ish lbs and go to prom with your girlfriends.
4808,It's stunning and the fit is perfect.
4809,"In that first picture I pictured you with a pretty drink in your hand, talking to a movie star."
4810,This is a gorgeous dress!
4811,Wear it with confidence 💞
4812,I wore a dress similar to this at my prom and loved feeling like a poofy princess all evening.
4813,Where what you love and what you feel comfortable in.
4814,"Also, that dress looks stunning!!"
4815,!
4816,That dress is freakin' beautiful.
4817,Tell him to get some class.
4818,You look like Cinderella.
4819,It’s gorgeous and you look like a princess (which is the point of prom dresses).

4821,There is nothing wrong with the dress.
4822,There is nothing wrong with the color.
4823,There is nothing wrong with the fit.
4824,There is nothing wrong with this dress's style at a prom.
4825,There is something wrong with your boyfriend.

4827,You're not his property.
4828,You're amazing.

4846,That dress is stunning and it looks wonderful on you.
4847,Why does he not like it?
4848,If you love it and obviously you feel beautiful in it or it wouldn't have been the one to catch your eye!
4849,I think it's so much prettier and elegant than some if the skimpy cocktail type dresses some of the girls wear.
4850,"Honey you look stunning, the dress is there to make you look and feel beautiful, not your boyfriend."
4851,If he can appreciate you in that dress then go by yourself and be happy.
4852,Your prom dress is beautiful.
4853,"Dump the date, you look like a Princess."
4854,"Seriously, you look like Cinderella and deserve a prom date who can see how beautiful you are!"

4856,I think it's a great dress.
4857,"I don't think there is a ""too much"" for prom until you start adding a train or something."
4858,"This is an understated color, a classic silhouette, and looks great on you."
4859,You look beautiful.
4860,He doesn’t see it.
4861,Maybe give him a couple good slaps to the head.
4862,this dress goes amazing with your skin tone and i think it also suits your body type and the dress itself is stunning so your bf is absolutely blind because everything you showed us is perfection
4863,"Not a mom, but a gay uncle."
4864,The dress is beautiful.
4865,"It might be more involved than some would wear to prom, but hon if you love it wear the shit out of it."
4866,It’s a great dress.
4867,"In ten years, you’ll only have pics of yourself, not everyone at prom."
4868,"It’s much more likely you’ll still have the dress, not the boyfriend so wear the hell out of it."
4869,It's beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love how classy and classic it is.
4870,Enjoy your prom.
4871,"No darling, the dress is lovely."
4872,Modern prom dresses seem to be more club wear.
4873,I think the dress is elegant and timeless.. Do you feel pretty in your dress?
4874,"I think it’s beautiful, and if it makes you feel how you want to feel, that’s a plus."
4875,"Clothes can have that effect, like when I put on a tux."
4876,It’s stunning!
4877,You look great.
4878,It is a lovely color.
4879,This mom thinks you look exquisite.

4898,He has no taste!
4899,No its beautiful and if you love it thats all that matters.
4900,If i were you id consider getting a new prom date
4901,Absolutely beautiful dress!
4902,And even though I don’t see your face it looks great on your skin tone!
4903,"Makes a beautiful waist and is also not a plain boring dress, but has a lot of chic to it!"
4904,"Sadly your boyfriend is rude and does not know yet, that what you wear is not to please him, but to please you."

4909,H o n e y.

4911,"I wore a mini dress with fishnets and combat boots to my senior ball, but as much as I loved that combo I always have wished I had done something long and elegant like yours here!"
4912,Proms are literally the best excuse to get extra dressed up!!
4913,Keep the dress!
4914,You look amazing!
4915,"Fuck him, it is a gorgeous dress!"
4916,Oh my god no this is GORGEOUS!!!
4917,This is truly stunning.
4918,So classy and elegant and whimsical!
4919,It’s truly beautiful and shows a lot of personality.
4920,I personally think a simple dress would be too boring for you.
4921,I love that this dress is so beautifully unique!
4922,Plus it fits you like a glove and that color looks amazing on your skin tone!
4923,I think if he doesn’t like the dress he doesn’t have to go to prom with you lol
4924,"Looks amazing, little sis."
4925,Gorgeous dress.
4926,Boyfriend is silly.
4927,Yooo I WISH my prom dress had been even close to this beautiful poufy Disney princess piece that you’re wearing.
4928,Tell the bf he can suck it up or you’ll find someone else to go with who appreciates your dress.
4929,Like me.
4930,I’m a mid thirties woman but I am a CHAMPION hype guy and will tell you how much I love this dress until you’re tired of hearing it.
4931,"Sister, I wore a very similar dress to my prom and I fit right in."
4932,Everyone wore fancy dresses.
4933,"Please don’t let this boy influence your dress decisions, you look amazing in this dress."
4934,You look like a princess!
4935,"Honestly, You look stunning in it!"
4936,It is a very pretty dress and it fits you nicely.
4937,Poofy Princess dress yes!!

4939,😍
4940,"Big sis here, I’ll tell him off for you!"
4941,You look amazing!
4942,"Not sure if this welcome since am a dude, BUT if it makes you feel nice and empowers you, than that’s all she wrote."
4943,He can kick rocks because doesn’t live in your body.
4944,It’s a very nice dress objectively and looks like quality.
4945,Wow these comments….
4946,He’s allowed to have an opinion on the dress ffs.
4947,“Tell your bf to shut his face”….
4948,Really?
4949,You’d all rather he lied to her?
4950,Healthy way to be in a relationship I’m sure.
4951,Looks lovely.
4952,I would pair it with very old Hollywood looking hair and makeup If it was me.
4953,"Soft finger wave curls, a soft red/pink lip, and nude matte eyeshadow in a classic style....but that's just me!"
4954,I like it and you should not worry too much of what your boyfriend thinks.
4955,Dad here.
4956,The dress is stunning.
4957,You look beautiful.
4958,"Don't worry about what anyone else thinks, even your boyfriend who is (apparently) visually challenged."
4959,You look gorgeous in that dress and you already know it and everyone will know it soon enough.
4960,Have a fun night.
4961,Honey the dress is gorgeous!
4962,Ask him what his issues are.
4963,I think it’s beautiful
4964,Big sister here.
4965,Your boyfriend is 100% talking out of his ass and deserves a foot kick to his for all the snide remarks he’s been making about your dress.
4966,The colour is lovely.
4967,It’s a very pretty grey toned green colour and the embroidering on it is stunning.
4968,"It hugs your figure in all the right places, shows off your shoulders and neck quite beautifully, and it looks sufficiently twirly in the skirt, perfect for a night at prom."
4969,"In all seriousness, tell you soon to be ex boyfriend to pound salt."
4970,"Go rock your prom❤️

Edit, spelling."
4971,It is gorgeous😍😍
4972,You look beautiful and have very good taste.
4973,"The dress is classic, gorgeous and fits you perfectly."
4974,My guess is the boyfriend wanted something more revealing so tell him he can wear something with his ass hanging out if he wants but that you have to much self respect to put yourself on show.
4975,That dress is gorgeous and it looks SO FLATTERING on you.
4976,Keep the dress - ditch the boyfriend.
4977,A person who makes you doubt yourself is not a person who deserves to be in your life.
4978,It’s STUNNING!
4979,That dress is stunning and the color is amazing with your skin tone!
4980,Wear it proudly and wear it for you.
4981,"Boys come and go, but being comfortable in your own skin will never go out of style."
4982,Keep the dress get rid of the boyfriend.
4983,"Not a mom, but the advice still stands."
4984,Dress looks great!
4985,Good your bf isn’t wearing it I guess.
4986,Looks great
4987,I think it's timeless and gorgeous!
4988,Absolutely gorgeous dress.
4989,The little sleeves are classy.
4990,I wore a dress I didn’t love to prom and I regret it to this day.
4991,I barely remember my dates name but I remember hating my dress.
4992,That is a spectacular dress.
4993,"If you love it, wear it."
4994,You’ll always remember it.
4995,"The boyfriend, not so much."
4996,"Not a mom, but you look absolutely stunning in that color dress!"
4997,It's beautiful and you might need to sit down with your boyfriend for a chat because he sounds like he's being a jerk.
4998,He should support your decision in anything you pick if you feel good wearing it.
4999,It’s not his decision to make.
5000,I think it's beautiful.
5001,I really like it.
5002,There are very few occasions where you get to dress up like this.
5003,Pick what you love.
5004,You do what makes you happy kid.
5005,"If you like the dress, that's really all that matters."
5006,The dress is beautiful and you look so beautiful in it and if your bf cant see that he’s an idiot.
5007,Do not let him ruin it for you
5008,There is no such thing as “too much for prom”!
5009,The dress looks fantastic.
5010,It’s been 30+ years and I still have my prom dress.
5011,It is a delightful late 80s confection.
5012,It still makes me giggle.
5013,You look like a princess and I love it.
5014,Fits you nicely but is not great.
5015,Omg this dress is perfect!
5016,"Honey, the pressure to fit in is insane now, even worse than it always was before due to social media."
5017,"This is a normal, pretty dress."
5018,He's probably just getting a prickly feeling because he's worried it isn't normal and doesn't fit the mold of what you'd see people on social media typically wearing.
5019,In most cases I think what's popular is more about looking sexy than beautiful.
5020,This dress is more about being beautiful and classic.
5021,Notice none of those words change the purpose of the dress.
5022,"It's a formal dress, and perfectly fine for this kind of dance."
5023,"Side note, why even listen to him at all?"
5024,Your body is your body and you need to decorate it in ways that make you happy.
5025,You chose a formal dress in order to conform to the event.
5026,Beyond that you should be picking whatever you enjoy!
5027,"For this particular dress I'd be inspired by old school Taylor swift and do big dramatic curls and embrace the pretty, elegant vibes."
5028,"If you go to a dance and other girls have dresses that are more trendy/sexy, you'll just look like a queen!"
5029,Nothing wrong with that.
5030,But if you did spend a lot of money and you aren't sure you like how it looks then absolutely change it out!
5031,There's no point if it doesn't make you happy.
5032,Just do it for you!
5033,"The dress is gorgeous, it suits your skin tone wonderfully."
5034,"If your boyfriend has a problem its because he is insecure at your level of beauty and he cannot fathom the idea of rising up to the level of beauty you exude, and because he is aware others will be looking at you and is trying to make you smaller."
5035,"Dont let him dim your light, you were born to shine just as bright as every other star that is dancing in the sky."
5036,Wear it.
5037,You are absolutely perfect in it.
5038,Do you love it?
5039,Yes?
5040,Then don't let anyone else bring you down about it.
5041,The only opinion that matters is yours.
5042,❤
5043,"This may be off the mark as I don’t know OP’s bf, but I have noticed a trend where boys want their dates to wear slinky, sexy dresses."
5044,More like you’d see at a Hollywood red carpet event.
5045,Not all girls are comfortable or confident in a dress like that but do it for their date.
5046,I think you look gorgeous.
5047,"It’s a lovely color, has tasteful and attractive beadwork, and the flowy fabric does give a princess vibe."
5048,"If you love it, wear it."
5049,Don’t let him influence your decision.
5050,"Take the dress out today, put it on, and see how it makes you feel."
5051,"If you feel beautiful, then his opinion is irrelevant."
5052,Oh Sweetie!
5053,That is a beautiful dress and you look wonderful in it!
5054,That dress is so pretty and you look like a freaking princess in it!
5055,Your boy is a hater👎🏻
5056,I love it.
5057,Wear it!
5058,And if he doesn't like it he can keep it to himself.
5059,Sibling here- the dress is STUNNING.
5060,How you feel about it and how you feel in it is what matters.
5061,Have a fun and safe time at prom!
5062,This detail on this dress is gorgeous and the shoulder/neckline is stunningly unique.
5063,The color is fantastic on you.
5064,"Wow this dress is gorgeous, I love the colour and the beading details."
5065,"Nope, it looks great."
5066,"And he's not right or wrong in this case, he just has an opinion on your dress."
5067,Your dress - not his - so all that matters is how you feel about it.
5068,Were you comfortable with the amount you spent?
5069,Do you love how it looks and feels?
5070,Doesn't hurt to think about different aspects of it.
5071,"At the end of the day go with how you feel, not how someone else feels."
5072,"You look lovely, dear child."
5073,Go to the prom and have fun!
5074,I love love love this dress.
5075,Your bf sucks- why does he have such a strong opinion on what YOUR dress looks like.
5076,Tell him to get a matching tie and stfu
5077,I’m a dude and that’s a beautiful prom dress
5078,It’s a beautiful dress.
5079,Wear it.
5080,Honey that is PERFECT for prom.
5081,You do what makes you happy.
5082,That is absolutely stunning and if it's what you want then go for it!
5083,Sounds like an ex-boyfriend to me.
5084,You look stunning.
5085,This is YOUR NIGHT.
5086,It’s a beautiful dress and you look beautiful in it.
5087,In 10 years you won’t even remember his name.
5088,FUCK HIM.
5089,Do you!!!!
5090,Your going to be the PRETTIEST girl there.
5091,💯He  really doesn’t deserve to go with you….
5092,Real talk !!!
5093,Don’t you dare change YOU or that dress ❤️❤️❤️❤️🌺
5094,Maybe cuz it’s just High School and not your wedding.
5095,Beautiful dress!
5096,Boyfriend needs a reality check.
5097,Sweeetheart.
5098,The day is for you to feel like the beautiful and amazing woman that you are becoming.
5099,Choose the dress that you want.
5100,The one you picked is lovely.
5101,Particularly because it’s you who makes it so.
5102,"Your boyfriend is entitled to his opinion, sure, but he is not entitled to stomp over your prom wishes."
5103,This is something I wish I learned sooner.
5104,"No man should outright pick what you wear and try to change it if he is not your parent teaching you what to appropriately wear (like, telling toddler you to not take your princess costume into a bath appropriate!"
5105,"), or giving input on what may be socially acceptable for a given occasion."
5106,"You should be the final authority on what you choose to wear, and any partner should not be pressuring you to change, especially when your choice is acceptable (and yours is more than acceptable for the prom!!)."
5107,That can be a red flag for many relationships depending on how they go about it.
5108,Just be careful.
5109,Have a good time.
5110,You are going to look great.
5111,And if he keeps telling you what to wear.
5112,It's beautiful!
5113,"You do you, fuck whatever anyone else thinks 🥰"
5114,Your boyfriend is wrong.
5115,That dress is fantastic.
5116,Huh?
5117,What’s wrong with the dress?
5118,That boy ain’t right.
5119,You look like Cinderella.
5120,He sucks.
5121,Get a new bf not a new dress
5122,Wearing the dress when trying it on and wearing the dress with a full wardrobe are two different things.
5123,Men don’t know what they’re saying sometimes.
5124,There’s been times where my bf won’t like something I bought either but I’ll say just wait til the final product.
5125,He always regrets judging so quick.
5126,"Find a good bra or try bra tape to support the girls so you can maintain the strapless look, go light on the makeup (focus on your lashes), and pair it with a cute hairstyle and shoes you like :) 
I hope you have a lot of fun."
5127,If your bf doesn’t like it by prom then tell him to get lost and you go find another guy or girlfriend to dance with.
5128,I absolutely love the color.
5129,I'd get my Fiance to wear this if I could ever find it
5130,It's beautiful and you absolutely should tell your jerk of a boyfriend who is tearing you down to suck it.
5131,"Personally I'd this is how he treats you now, reconsider if this is how you want to spend your life."
5132,He's already making your question reality and destroying the live you have for a dress.
5133,"There are so many other guys your age that would treat you with the love, respect and kindness you deserve."
5134,That’s so pretty!
5135,I love the style.
5136,Your boy-friend needs to talk to me.
5137,I’ll tell him that this style is a throwback and is timelessly beautiful.
5138,You look great in it hon!
5139,"He needs to accept that it’s what you chose and that it looks beautiful on you, too."
5140,Looks beautiful and fits you so nicely.
5141,"If you chose it because you liked it, then enjoy being a lovely woman with beautiful taste"
5142,"I think it’s dreamy, especially on you."
5143,I’m not a fan of that boy.
5144,"I think you can do better, is there someone nice who hasn’t yet been asked to the dance?"
5145,"Think about starting over with a whole new date for the dance, a sweet date of your choosing and have a blast in this beautiful dress that reminds me of Cinderella!"
5146,👗
5147,It looks great.
5148,Dress is beautiful boyfriend sounds sus….
5149,You did not make a mistake…..with the dress
5150,He can shut up.
5151,I like it!
5152,!
5153,"It is very, very pretty!"
5154,And fits you beautifully!
5155,I think the boyfriend that you chose is bad.
5156,"I love the dress, it looks beautiful on you!"
5157,"If you love the dress, it's the right dress."
5158,"If the BF hates it, wrong BF."
5159,It's stunning!
5160,I would have been so happy to wear something that wonderful to my prom.
5161,You and the dress are beautiful
5162,"Listen, that color is gorgeous on you, the cut is fantastic."
5163,"It hits you perfectly at the natural waist and the fuller skirt is not too full, so it looks like with the fabric you'll get great swish factor."
5164,"Against a partner in a black suit, or even just a white shirt and black or even tan pants, you'll pop."
5165,The neckline is to DIE for.
5166,"It's not to low, but it's not nun territory and the support straps are simple and discrete."
5167,"Any flower that they pick up as a corsage in the classic shades (If you still do that sort of thing) Be it pink, red, white, a pale cream etc etc will match with that dress."
5168,"You, are going to be gorgeous, you have chosen quite honestly even better that I chose for my wedding dress and you will be great."
5169,"Seriously, the beading..."
5170,I keep going back to the first picture.
5171,"It's lovely, it's most certainly formal and you need to take a deep breath and stand back for a moment and appreciate how stellar you chose for a prom dress."
5172,Seriously.
5173,"It’s stunning 🤩 you look amazing, and if you feel amazing yet your boyfriend puts your look down - he’s not worth your time"
5174,"That dress is gorgeous and you look enchanting in it…- 37-year old, straight, married, male."
5175,I think it is a lovely dress
5176,"Your dress is beautiful, sweetie."
5177,"That dress is lovely, dear."
5178,The color and fit are both flattering on you.
5179,"And it's most definitely not ""too much"" for prom."
5180,"It's beautiful, classy, and very tame, in my opinion."
5181,"Mine was a glittery solid gold number with a bare back and slit up to my thigh, lol!"
5182,Wear what makes you feel beautiful and don't let some boyfriend make you feel regretful about it.
5183,Your bf is an ass for saying that.
5184,Just saying.
5185,I think it’s beautiful.
5186,Really really elegant.
5187,Men are trash.
5188,Wear the dress.
5189,😘
5190,It is a very pretty dress and you look lovely in it!
5191,"Also, it looks like good quality fabric and like it is well made."
5192,Classy!
5193,There’s not going to be a whole lot of opportunities to wear a gorgeous floofy dress in life and isn’t that a huge part of what prom is for?
5194,If he wants simple then he can dress simple.
5195,"My gut is saying he’s either jealous of other ppl looking at you, maybe he’s controlling??"
5196,Idk from reading one paragraph on Reddit I’m only going off my own experiences.
5197,"However, I do know that if this dress makes you feel beautiful then wear it with no hesitation; don’t ever let someone, especially a guy steal your shine girl."
5198,That dress is very elegant and fits you well.
5199,Teenage boys don't usually know a whole lot about pretty dresses.
5200,With the right strapless bra it should be very nice - your boyfriend can wear something more casual if he wishes - the point id for the both of you to be comfortable and have a fun and pleasant evening together.
5201,What a gorgeous dress!!
5202,!
5203,Your boyfriend is an ass.
5204,The dress is pretty and it fits you well and that alone is worth a million dollars.
5205,It's plenty nice for prom.
5206,The only thing that matters in a dress is how you feel in it.
5207,"It doesn't matter if others like it, everyone has different tastes."
5208,As long as you feel pretty that's all that matters
5209,Your dress is beautiful!
5210,Your boyfriend is probably insecure and projecting.
5211,You look stunning!
5212,"Hey little sis, mom's right."
5213,Your dress is GORGEOUS!
5214,Wear it to prom and enjoy feeling like a princess.
5215,It's the best night to do it.
5216,The dress is beautiful!
5217,Its a gorgeous color and I can just imagine your hair done in a beautiful up do.
5218,You look like royalty
5219,Prom doesn’t matter in life.
5220,Just roll with it be happy.
5221,Realize there is a lot more to come that will overshadow what ever happens on prom night.
5222,It's giving me Cinderella at the ball vibes ❤️
5223,"Honey, you look like Cinderella in the best possible way."
5224,💙
5225,Stunning
5226,I love the shoulders!
5227,Such beautiful details!
5228,Get a new date who knows how to complement you.
5229,Not a mom or dad this is in popular but this is dope its got major Cinderella vibes
5230,Uh what?
5231,That’s absolutely gorgeous.
5232,I love that color and the beadwork.
5233,Do you like it?
5234,That’s the most important person.
5235,Because I think you look most beautiful in whatever you like!
5236,What??
5237,"Dude you look magical, why tf would he not love this?"
5238,"The color, cut, detailing, all of it is amazing."
5239,You’re gonna look so beautiful at your prom.
5240,I got a so-so dress for my prom and I’ve regretted it ever since.
5241,Your gown looks lovely and is the perfect prom dress!
5242,Enjoy it!
5243,!
5244,It is absolutely beautiful hun.
5245,"And if he says it’s too dressy for prom, tell him “it is always better to be overdressed than underdressed.”"
5246,I think it’s totally fair to answer you honestly if you asked about his opinion.
5247,I think it looks great though.
5248,[As a Dad in this thread...](https://i.imgur.com/mDQ6jtm.gif)
5249,"Fuck your boyfriend, you’re a princess!"
5250,That dress is your date.
5251,"Love, mom."
5252,This dress makes you look like you stepped out of a fairytale book!
5253,"He should be the prince to your princess, not the evil stepmother queen."
5254,It looks great!
5255,Why would he say such a thing?
5256,Prom is supposed to be fancy and fun.
5257,My dress was formal and boyfriend wore a tux.
5258,What is boyfriend planning on wearing?
5259,The embroidery is beautiful.
5260,It’s a gorgeous dress and flatters your figure.
5261,Wear it with your head high.
5262,You look gorgeous.
5263,Get a new date.
5264,He’s not good enough for you.
5265,- love mom
5266,"I wore the same color to prom a few years ago, but would have DIED to wear something with this gorgeous embroidery and princess feel!!!!!"
5267,WOW.
5268,"When I was in high school, my boyfriend also hated my prom dress."
5269,"But I wore it anyway, and I 100% do not and will never regret that decision!"
5270,Since when have teen boys been the most knowledgeable about fashion for teen girls?
5271,I look back on my prom pictures and I still LOVE my dress.
5272,"And I know you probably want him to like it because you want him to think you look beautiful, which I understand."
5273,Well guess what: you do look beautiful!
5274,You look stunning!
5275,And his opinion on your dress can’t change that!
5276,"I’m assuming you bought this dress because you love it, and that is literally all that matters."
5277,"But just in case you need more reassurance, I love it too!"
5278,Keep the dress.
5279,Replace the boy.
5280,You look beautiful.
5281,Your boyfriend is gay.
5282,You dressed up for a romantic nite out and he is worried about fashion.
5283,You look beautiful!!!
5284,Like a gorgeous snow Queen it is amazing
5285,I think it's elegant and looks great on you.
5286,❤️
5287,What a shitty boyfriend.
5288,Oh honey.
5289,"Dump the boy, keep the dress!"
5290,It’s beautiful.
5291,"Get a man as a boyfriend, not a kid who doesn’t treat his girl right."
5292,The dress is beautiful.
5293,Don’t know what is up with your boyfriend.
5294,The comments are right.
5295,"If there was ever a time or place to wear this dress it's prom, wear it while you can."
5296,You can always be basic later.
5297,Would suggest going strapless if you can though.
5298,"Also normalize wearing whatever you want, as long as it makes you feel good."
5299,You should always please yourself first.
5300,Do not second guess your decision based on some thought of this boy.
5301,"It is a gorgeous color, fits you well and the detailing is fabulous."
5302,He needs to get glasses.
5303,He may be inwardly upset because you are excited.
5304,He is not interested in your joy.
5305,He should be.
5306,Ditch him and go with a bunch of girlfriends - you'll have more fun!
5307,The group of you should dance all night!
5308,Have fun!!
5309,Be safe.
5310,Does it make you feel beautiful?
5311,Then wear it!
5312,You look stunning.
5313,It’s beautiful.
5314,Love that color on you.
5315,Keep the dress and ditch the boyfriend.
5316,That dress is gorgeous and you make it look amazing.
5317,I love everything about it.
5318,Have fun at prom!
5319,"Keep the dress, rethink the boyfriend."
5320,Oh my gosh I love this so much!
5321,It’s gorgeous.
5322,I love the color and the embroidery.
5323,It’s also timeless so it won’t look dated in pictures.
5324,"Oh honey, you look beautiful!"
5325,I went to prom with a boyfriend once with a similar attitude towards my dress.
5326,I went all out for this prom because it was my first one with a boyfriend.
5327,I thought that was special.
5328,"Over dinner before prom he told me, “You know, Squisha, you really aren’t that pretty.” And you know, FUCK THAT GUY."
5329,Go to prom FOR YOU and rock the hell out of that dress.
5330,"Honey, your dress is amazing!"
5331,You look like you’ve stepped out of a fairytale.
5332,Definitely don’t regret this dress!
5333,Your boyfriend is being an absolute twit!
5334,Maybe get some friends together and go with them instead if he’s making you feel bad about this gorgeous dress.
5335,And definitely get a small tiara or some sparkly hair accessories to complete your princess vibe!
5336,"Keep the dress, return the bf."
5337,"You look beautiful, kiddo!"
5338,No way!
5339,"It’s a beautiful dress, and if he’s trying to make you unhappy about it, he’s not worth it."
5340,I like it.
5341,And you rock it.
5342,The dress is gorgeous and it fits you perfectly!
5343,You’re going to receive so many compliments on prom night!
5344,"If you love is sis then that’s all that matters, periodt"
5345,This is adorable!
5346,"We don’t do prom in Australia, we do ‘formals’ and it’s not very ball-gown-esque, but this dress is like a little fairytale dress, what’s his deal!"
5347,Oh my God that dress is awesome!!
5348,I would have killed for that shade of blue/green.
5349,When I was went to prom.
5350,Ps it’s not my favorite but it’s also not my style….
5351,Own your style sis you got this
5352,I do love the color though
5353,"100% Cinderella, I absolutely love it!"
5354,"Its classy and formal but also not gaudy, lovely all together."
5355,"And listen, maybe he is decent but usually a guy knows better than to make a girl insecure about an important outfit."
5356,Either he learned that lesson or he is not a great guy and you will remember the dress more than him in 20 years (most of is do!).
5357,"Watch and see, I will ask you."
5358,And so what if it is different than the others?!
5359,So are you!
5360,If prom and this time in your life is not the time to let your little light shine then it never will be!
5361,Have fun dancing and swishing in your stunning dress!
5362,Sis that dress is absolutely beautiful and you look incredible.
5363,Walk in there like the queen you are.
5364,❤️ prom is all about getting dressed up and feeling beautiful!!!
5365,!
5366,"That dress is timeless, he probably wants something “trendy”."
5367,In 10-20 years from now you’ll be glad this is the dress you wore and you (probably) will barely remember his name.
5368,This is one of the most stunning prom dresses I have ever seen.
5369,"Truly it is gorgeous, like a princess dress!"
5370,"Not sure what your BF's issue is, but it seems like he's made you so insecure about this, and that isn't cool at all - it's kind of crappy, actually."
5371,"I hope you keep the dress and wear it proudly, it looks like it would be fun to twirl around in."
5372,I think it is absolutely gorgeous!
5373,Gorgeous!
5374,My favorite color!
5375,Have a fabulous time!
5376,Be fierce!
5377,What the hell!!!
5378,He doesn’t like it!?
5379,It’s so pretty!!!
5380,What wrong with him
5381,You don’t need to break up with your boyfriend just because he has one shit take on a prom dress.
5382,The dress is gorgeous.
5383,You picked it for a reason.
5384,"We really need to talk about that boyfriend though, that’s the real issue."
5385,"If you are happy with it, then he should be happy for you."
5386,"If he doesn't get excited or happy just seeing you happy he isn't worth it, and likely isn't somebody you would want to spend your life with."
5387,Dump him.
5388,"Your dress looks vintage and classy, and that's why I like it."
5389,It looks like what a princess would wear on a special starry night.
5390,You are letting your boyfriend get into your head.
5391,Don't let him make you feel insecure.
5392,Your dress is great.
5393,Are they serious???
5394,"Honey not only does that dress look amazing, it looks absolutely FANTASTIC on you!"
5395,That color goes so nicely with your tones and the cut off the dress is just lovely!
5396,Honestly that boyfriend needs an immediate shut down or even a full on dump cause he's so CLEARLY in the wrong!
5397,If he insists he's right then go with a group of friends to prom.
5398,"Yes lots of people do that, the goal is for you to look amazing and have a good time, and you already have the first step down!"
5399,"Not a mom, but my prom date wore a super fancy dress."
5400,Like she imported it from another country and was made specifically for her.
5401,I just wore a rented tux.
5402,"What I’m saying is, if you like it, and you spent the money on it, wear it and have fun!"
5403,Fear…..
5404,"Sister here and no, the dress looks very nice!"
5405,You might want to talk with your boyfriend.
5406,Is he always like this?
5407,"Anyways, you look amazing don’t listen to your bf!"
5408,"If your bf cares about how your dress looks, you don't have a boyfriend, but he has a beard."
5409,Looks like a quinceañera dress
5410,"It's more quincanera, less Prom 2022."
5411,But ultimately it's about what YOU like.
5412,The dress is beautiful.
5413,Throw the whole boy out.
5414,That dress is princess-level beautiful.
5415,Babygirl that dress I stunning.
5416,Gorgeous color and fits you so well
5417,You look like cinderella
5418,Keep the dress!
5419,Do birds gather when you sing?
5420,Here’s one way you can lose some unnecessary accessories to make this look better - *go by yourself*.
5421,You look beautiful.
5422,You look like a Princess!!!
5423,A Princess who needs a new boyfriend!
5424,I love the color and it fits you beautifully.
5425,What is supposed to be his problem with it?
5426,Sounds like the problem might just be him.
5427,"Not to late to find a better date or just go with a group of friends, looking fabulous, and having fun."
5428,Sis!
5429,THAT DRESS IS SO BEAUTIFUL!
5430,You need to ditch him.
5431,"Fuck him, that dress is gorgeous."
5432,"It reminds me of my own prom dress for junior year, except mine was gray."
5433,Don’t listen to him.
5434,He wouldn’t know beauty if it smacked him in the face… because it IS!
5435,Yeh it’s an ugly dress.
5436,Coming from an honest guy.
5437,Honey you look so good.
5438,Never let a man's opinion dictate your decisions.
5439,Go to the prom with your head held high and party your booty off lovie.
5440,Alright.
5441,Not a mom here.
5442,"In fact, I’m not a dad either."
5443,What I’ve got to say is this.
5444,"If you like it, you like how you look in it, and you feel good in it, wear it."
5445,"If your boyfriend wants the dress he imagined for prom, he can wear it himself."
5446,tell your boyfriend to find a tie that matches and shut the fuck up.
5447,\-from  someones dad
5448,The dress is so beautiful and unique!
5449,I haven’t seen one like that before.
5450,Don’t worry about what your bf or anyone else thinks.
5451,It looks amazing on you and I know you’re going to rock it!
5452,"And if your bf is making you feel bad about it, that’s a little red flag."
5453,"This is your decision, hon."
5454,"If he continues with this negativity, take a step back from him and just focus on loving yourself."
5455,LGTM.
5456,\- Dad
5457,The cut on this is very flattering on you!
5458,"You look like a princess, if that’s the vibe you’re going for, the dress is perfect."
5459,"He doesn’t sound like much of a prince, though."
5460,"Prom is finite, I guess if you play it right you could have 4 or 5, but some like me only have one."
5461,"Mine was amazing because it was me and my girls, and the dates could only hang if they didn’t harsh the mellow."
5462,"Given how much his bs immaturity with caring what others think seems to dominate, I wonder how much he’d like to go alone."
5463,Umm.
5464,Not a mom but that dress is beautiful on you!
5465,!
5466,It’s gorgeous and your boyfriend is a tool.
5467,The dress is beautiful!
5468,I love that color.
5469,You know what would make the dress prettier is if you wore it without him standing next to you on prom night
5470,bae where did you get that ?
5471,i still need a dress
5472,Forget the dress.
5473,Let’s talk about the boyfriend.
5474,"A boyfriend worth keeping, if he knew you like the dress, would NEVER tell you anything other than  how beautiful you look in it."
5475,It doesn’t matter if it isnt his favorite style.
5476,He wouldn’t hurt your feelings or put you in a position to doubt yourself like this.
5477,He gets a pass as a human because of his age.
5478,"He’s young, he’s allowed yo be stupid while he grows."
5479,He does NOT get a pass from me as your boyfriend.
5480,There are plenty of guys that regardless of their youth would have never dared to put down your dress like this.
5481,Make no mistake.
5482,Your dress is fine.
5483,It fits amazingly well and you look absolutely great in it.
5484,The boyfriend making you doubt tgat?
5485,NOT FINE.
5486,Odds are you'll be moving on from this boyfriend.
5487,But you'll always love the dress you picked!
5488,Wear it and love it and cherish the pictures even if you can't remember his name down the road!
5489,"Omg honey, that dress is gorgeous."
5490,It's incredibly elegant.
5491,"That being said, your boyfriend is certainly entitled to his own opinion."
5492,But there's a very important life lesson he clearly hasn't learned yet: he should have kept his mouth shut.
5493,"Liking someone means liking them for who they are, and being happy for them when they are happy."
5494,"You like the dress clearly, and from his perspective, that should be all that matters."
5495,And obviously this applies in vice versa too.
5496,"Say he shows up in a bright red top hat and tails, beaming from ear to ear."
5497,What would be the right thing to do?
5498,To crush his enjoyment by telling him how stupid he looks?
5499,Or humor him and let him have his fun?
5500,This is all basic respect for and acceptance of others for who they are.
5501,You look beautiful.
5502,Beyond gorgeous and fits perfectly.
5503,"It's classy, tasteful and fits you well."
5504,Can't say the same for your boyfriend.
5505,"Seriously, that dress is gorgeous!"
5506,Who cares if he doesn’t like it.
5507,It’s beautiful.
5508,He doesn’t deserve you.
5509,If you feel beautiful in the dress then its perfect.
5510,That is all that matters
5511,I thibk you look like cinderella!
5512,Very pretty
5513,I think it’s very pretty.
5514,🌸
5515,I LOVE your dress.
5516,"The color, the detailing, the overall princess vibe."
5517,Too bad gorgeous isn’t what your boyfriend had in mind; he can dress however he wants and you will eclipse him with your awesomeness.
5518,it is lovely.
5519,obviously your boyfriend has no or little taste.
5520,did he get covid?
5521,No.
5522,Get a new bf because that dress is beautiful.
5523,"Imo it's very nice, but isn't very modern."
5524,It looks slightly like a disney princess.
5525,"I do think he's overreacting though, and that this should be your choice."
5526,You've got a great look and the dress is more than perfect for a prom night!
5527,"Keep the dress, lose the boyfriend."
5528,The dress is perfect!!
5529,Boyfriend less perfect.
5530,Keep the dress get rid of the boyfriend and have fun at prom 😁
5531,I think it’s lovely!
5532,Maybe because it’s not very modern?
5533,This is the exact dress I would have designed for myself as a little girl.
5534,Very Disney-Princess.
5535,I love everything about it from the sleeves to the full skirt.
5536,That dress is beautiful on you and it is perfect for prom.
5537,Your boyfriend can wear a different dress if he wants a different dress to be worn.
5538,Dump the bf.
5539,Keep that gorgeous dress.
5540,"Color is amazing, detail is amazing, cut and fit it amazing."
5541,Hey sis!!
5542,That dress is stunning!!
5543,"You look like a Disney princess, like Cinderella 😍 I love it!!"
5544,And you loving it is all that matters anyway!
5545,FWIW I went stag with all my girlfriends and we all had a BLAST!
5546,;)
5547,How do you feel in it?
5548,"If you feel beautiful and can imagine yourself having fun at prom in it, it's perfect!"
5549,It isn't very mature.
5550,It's like someone took 120 year old drapes and tried to fashion them into a dress for a Disney princess.
5551,Looks fantastic!
5552,Wear it with pride!
5553,The gown is beautiful and so are you.
5554,Confidence is key.
5555,I think it is beautiful.
5556,"Dad not Mom, but still."
5557,Great looking dress!
5558,Enjoy wearing it as often as possible.
5559,"Make sure you get some nice pictures of the event, you, and your dress."
5560,"Oh, and dump your boyfriend, what a dope!"
5561,I think you look beautiful:)
5562,Omg a tiara would look so cute with this
5563,Not very flattering for your body type.
5564,My first take was a modern cinderella!
5565,You rock that dress.
5566,"I hope your boyfriend can find a way to make you feel beautiful, because even if the dress isn’t his preference, the important thing is your feelings and your confidence"
5567,"The dress is beautiful baby, it's the boyfriend you need to be eyeing like trash."
5568,You dress is stunning.
5569,Your BF is ridiculous and has no taste.
5570,Hope you have a great Prom !
5571,Beautiful!
5572,You look stuuuuuuuuuuning!
5573,"Listen honey, the dress is lovely, your boyfriend was probably hoping for something skimpy, he's not worth the hassle."
5574,Needs punctuations.
5575,😑😑
5576,"Ew, no."
5577,Throw the whole boyfriend away.
5578,It’s a classy and timeless dress.
5579,"Wear it for you, not him."
5580,He mad because you're a gotdamn princess and he's a frog!!!
5581,But seriously.
5582,"It's ok if he doesn't love the style, everyone has different tastes."
5583,But what's not ok is being mean about it.
5584,"A good partner would think of positive things to comment on and remember that you get to choose your clothes, not them."
5585,"A good partner doesn't use the excuse ""I'm just being honest"" or ""I'm just giving my opinion, you asked what I thought"" to justify being controlling or rude."
5586,High school teacher here- I see lots of dresses like this at prom.
5587,I hope you wear what makes you happy in your body and on your arm as a date.
5588,You look fabulous!
5589,It's beautiful!
5590,And so flattering.
5591,It's the boyfriend that's ugly.
5592,Why are people lying?
5593,This dress if from the 90s.
5594,Stop lying to this poor girl wtf?
5595,You got scammed on a ugly dress.
5596,Take the L and move on
5597,You look beautiful and if he was a nice person he’d tell you the same.
5598,Don’t waste time on a person who makes you question yourself and your choices.
5599,Oh my god honey that looks beautiful.
5600,You look like a damn princess.
5601,Too bad icy pastel eyeliner is out of fashion because that would pop so hard with that dress.
5602,Your boyfriend can go suck an egg.
5603,You look fucking amazing.
5604,You’re beautiful.
5605,"Now, keep the dress but exchange the boyfriend."
5606,"I know how you're feeling, my boy friend hated my prom dress my senior year too."
5607,"It was really upsetting at the time, but looking back at pictures the dress was STUNNING and the boyfriend was the mistake (not the other way round)."
5608,"Trust me, you look gorgeous and you will be soo grateful in a few years that you took this opportunity to wear a beautiful dress that really embodies you (not your boyfriend)."
5609,That dress is so gorgeous
5610,"That dress is gorgeous, and I'm sure you're going to look absolutely beautiful in it."
5611,"I don't know why your boyfriend hates it, maybe because he doesn't have anything so awesome to wear, but he's wrong."
5612,"I don't know how much money it cost, but it sure looks expensive."
5613,You did good!
5614,It’s gorgeous.
5615,Get a new boyfriend!
5616,Your dress is stunning!
5617,That ass hat doesn't seem to deserve to see you in it
5618,"Save the dress, ditch the boyfriend."
5619,He's clearly blind
5620,You seriously look like a goddamn princess and that man is not a prince.
5621,It's lovely.
5622,"Just a short time ago, queens and noblewomen would have been the only ones who could afford to wear a dress with that much intricate beadwork and embroidery."
5623,So tell him you're royal AF and flounce away.
5624,Your dress looks great for flouncing.
5625,Sweet heart you looks like a moon beam who swirled her way from between wisteria blossoms!
5626,You looks like the oceans best Pearl on a silk pillow!
5627,Your dress is lovely and perfect for prom.
5628,It's timeless and well-fitted and would be perfect for future formal occasions as well.
5629,"Not sure what your boyfriend's problem is, but I hope you give some serious thought to your relationship."
5630,You deserve to be treated well and there is NEVER a situation where it's okay for someone to make you feel bad about your appearance or fashion choices.
5631,"Disagreement is an unavoidable part of any relationship, but the way a person handles disagreement says a lot about them."
5632,"If you're being made to feel bad over a dress, imagine how you'll be made to feel when you disagree about something that's actually important."
5633,I'm mid 30s and go to a decent amount of black tie events in my city.
5634,"Your boyfriend is clearly insecure about something because this seems ten times as elegant as what my idiot friends wore to prom and wouldn't be super out of place at an inaugural ball, opera premiere, etc."
5635,"I'd turn it around on him and basically say that unless he looks like Bond in a Tom Ford tux and shows up with a brand new Seamaster on his wrist, he can take his opinions and stick em."
5636,Fair is fair and what not.
5637,EDIT: I'm a dude.
5638,So big brother or older cousin for a minute.
5639,Same idea.
5640,The dress is beautiful and fits you perfectly.
5641,I love it.
5642,"I say keep the dress, replace the boyfriend."
5643,"You deserve someone who builds you up, not someone who brings you down."
5644,"There’s a reason you picked it, if you loved it and felt amazing when you bought it then you need to stand up for that!"
5645,As a dad I think it looks terrific
5646,"Not even close to a mom, but that dress is gorgeous."
5647,Don't doubt your taste in dresses.
5648,"It is a beautiful dress, very classy."
5649,"The dress is beautiful, the boyfriend is afraid you will look so good, you might upgrade."
5650,When does everyone start singing “Let it go”?
5651,"There is nothing wrong here, looks nice"
5652,You look lovely!
5653,I had a high school boyfriend who also had opinions on how I dressed.
5654,"Turned out, he was verbally abusive."
5655,"When my daughter tells me she doesn’t like a piece of clothing, I tell her that she is entitled to her opinion, but I’m wearing it because I like it."
5656,You do you.
5657,You boyfriend doesn’t have the luxury of color.
5658,He can choose black or black.
5659,Like one guy is going to choose something different.
5660,He gets to choose the pocket square.
5661,"You, you get to choose what you feel beautiful in."
5662,Baby your prom dress is beautiful and you look beautiful in it.
5663,Might be time to throw the whole boy away.
5664,Boyfriends are like pancakes - no shame in throwing them away if they're a little messed up.
5665,I know it's a different sub but let me be dad for a minute.
5666,That is a lovely dress and you have great taste.
5667,"Don't ever let anyone, ESPECIALLY a boy make you doubt yourself."
5668,"Go to the prom in the dress, with or without the boy, and make good memories."
5669,"Be safe, be smart, and have fun"
5670,Happy dress.
5671,Much flowers and swirls!
5672,Look a good be yourself.
5673,Don’t listen to the haters.
5674,Keep yourself happy and if the others aren’t happy for you they don’t have your best interests in mind.
5675,It is gorgeous....
5676,Not a mom but asked a mom - she thinks it's beautiful and doesn't see anything wrong with it.
5677,The dress is beautiful.
5678,"Most of us only get to wear beautiful, extravagant, dresses a few times in our lives."
5679,Prom is one of them.
5680,Go as all out as you want and screw what anyone else thinks.
5681,Disney Princess vibes
5682,Bruh who talks bad about their girls dress?
5683,Even if it was objectively bad I'm only gonna dab her up.
5684,"Hey sis,

I actually stopped scrolling in my feed just because I wanted to know the story behind the stunning dress."
5685,"The dress is not the problem, but the boyfriend might be."
5686,"OP, Sweetie you look stunning the dress is very beautiful Don't regret your decision and dont at all believe your boyfriend who cares if he hates it hes not wearing it you are you got it for you, you also got got because im assuming you fell in love with the dress, so please dont doubt yourself you are a strong beautiful young woman who can choose to wear whatever you want have a lovely prom sweetie they're a once in a lifetime opportunity spend it happy"
5687,Boyfriend sounds pretty manipulative to me.
5688,"Sweetheart, you look so beautiful!"
5689,"You fell in love with the dress, right?"
5690,Then it’s the perfect dress for you.
5691,Your boyfriend is entitled to his opinion but he was being pretty dumb to flat out tell you he doesn’t like it.
5692,You tell him it’s your dream dress and you love it and if he’s truly bothered then you don’t need to take a date at all.
5693,I hope your prom is absolutely wonderful.
5694,"You rock that dress, girl!"
5695,The dress is beautiful.
5696,The boyfriend is being a jerk.
5697,I think it’s great.
5698,You look beautiful darling!
5699,It’s so pretty and it fits you so well!!
5700,!
5701,Wow!
5702,The dress is beautiful!
5703,Please sweetheart don’t let boys make you doubt yourself.
5704,"If they do, they aren’t worthy of you."
5705,"So, maybe you need a new boyfriend not a new dress."
5706,Enjoy the prom!
5707,Just so you know I went to my prom alone and had an amazing time with my friends!
5708,"The dress is beautiful, it looks great on you."
5709,The boyfriend is a controlling ass.
5710,You deserve so much better.
5711,Beautiful dress.
5712,Love that neckline.
5713,Hope you have an awesome time.
5714,With or without BF.
5715,Do not let him ruin your prom!
5716,I literally sat up when I saw it.
5717,"It's elegant and lovely, and isn't that what prom is supposed to be?!!"
5718,"Also kinda giving some Frozen vibes, if you're into that."
5719,THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL
5720,I'm a guy and I like your dress.
5721,The silly boyfriend doesn't have taste.
5722,I would go to prom with a girl who is wearing that dress or just wear it myself and be all fabulous.
5723,This dress is magical!
5724,You look amazing in it.
5725,Have an amazing time at Prom and don't let him get you down.
5726,He sounds dumb.
5727,That dress is gorgeous!
5728,the dress is really pretty.
5729,make sure to wear a strapless bra though!
5730,screw your boyfriend.
5731,"It’s gorgeous, fits beautifully, lovely color, and perfect for prom!!!"
5732,Love the flower details!!
5733,!
5734,It looks like a beautiful princess gown and I think your boyfriend needs to be dumped
5735,Aw buddy.. your dress is beautiful.
5736,I don't think you need to be involved with anyone who makes you feel this way.
5737,"If this was one of your female friends and their bf said this stuff, what would your advice be to them?"
5738,"Your dress looks magical and if he can't see that, and he hurts you like this, then he's not a good man."
5739,Absolutely not!
5740,You look good!
5741,It is gorgeous.
5742,This is beautiful and I’d love to know where you got it!
5743,Any boy that dismisses something you obviously like isn’t worth your time.
5744,"If he isn’t crazy head over heels, say whatever/do whatever to make you happy right now, he never will be."
5745,You deserve much better.
5746,The dress is absolutely beautiful!
5747,"Not a mum, or a dad for that matter, but it looks lovely."
5748,I'm sure you will look amazing and I hope you have an incredible night :)
5749,I think it's pretty!
5750,Looks kinda like a vintage style which I like!
5751,"I wouldn't listen to your boyfriend's opinion, there are a lot of things that individuals don't like but that doesn't mean everyone won't like it, fashion is very subjective."
5752,I've definitely had some people hate something I'm wearing and other people love it (also because trends change over time).
5753,If you like the dress don't let someone else's opinion change that!
5754,Beautiful!
5755,I saw the dress before I was able to read the caption.
5756,Plz keep the dress and replace the boyfriend.
5757,Spoken from a mom that had 3 kids from the age from 22-17.
5758,Find a man that appreciates your beauty!
5759,🙌
5760,I think it’s gorgeous!
5761,Ditch that boy.
5762,"The dress is for you, he only gets the company of the wearer."
5763,Your boyfriend hates the dress??
5764,?
5765,This is amazing!!
5766,You look like a literal princess (in the absolute best way).
5767,I truly love it.
5768,And that color is one of my favorites!
5769,I think you look lovely.
5770,<3
5771,I'd adore having that dress.
5772,100% keep it.
5773,"I think maybe you should change..

&#x200B;

..your boyfriend."
5774,IT’S BEAUTIFUL
5775,The dress is beautiful.
5776,"As a mom, I can tell you the boyfriend might not be the right guy."
5777,Proceed with caution with that one.
5778,Tell him to Google “prom dresses” to see what comes up in images.
5779,Dresses just like this.
5780,It’s beautiful.
5781,"More importantly, do you like it?"
5782,Do you like how it makes you feel in it?
5783,"If yes, there is no issue."
5784,I’m curious what kind of dress he would choose.
5785,Maybe have him show you some styles that he likes.
5786,"After he’s done that, thank him for his input but tell him you just really like the dress that you picked out."
5787,🥰
5788,It is absolutely glorious.
5789,You look like an elven princes
5790,I’m a mom and I would be so happy if one of my sons’ dates wore this and not some skank dress
5791,"The colour is beautiful, it sits really nice but that edge at the top
is very outdated."
5792,maybe you can take the edge off?
5793,Hey sib!
5794,That dress looks so nice on you!
5795,It reminds me a lot of the one I wore when I went to prom!
5796,It fits perfectly and just looks so lovely on you.
5797,"You're gonna go to prom, have a great time, and rock it in that beautiful dress."
5798,Boyfriend can get over it and accept how beautiful you look or go find something else to do on prom night.
5799,I will be honest I personally don’t like the dress hunny but your style is your style and if you feel beautiful in it that’s all that matters.
5800,It looks lovely - it is YOUR dress.
5801,BF was probably expecting something from Victoria's Secret.
5802,It's lovely and you look wonderful.
5803,What is up with your boyfriend?
5804,Does he have an aversion to the color?
5805,My girlfriend says it's absolutely beautiful
5806,It looks fantastic!
5807,Looks like it fits perfect.
5808,Great detail at the top too.
5809,"Not a mom, just a dude who uses this sub for advice, but if you want my two cents."
5810,I dont see anything wrong with it.
5811,You bought because you like the dress.
5812,Wear that with pride.
5813,Rock that dress.
5814,Love it
5815,Oh honey your dress is absolutely gorgeous and it looks beautiful on you!
5816,Please don't let anyone make you feel bad about the things you like and wear.
5817,You deserve to have only people in your life who lift you up and make you feel good about yourself.
5818,I'm sorry your boyfriend hasn't been doing that.
5819,"I hope he's able to learn the right way to treat you, but if he doesn't, just remember that there are plenty of people who will, and you deserve to spend your time with those people, not people who tear you down."
5820,"Dress looks gorgeous; high school boys don't know shit, *especially* about dresses."
5821,Do you; not him.
5822,It reminds me of Cinderella .
5823,Its gorgeous and the right boy will like what you like 😎 it’s absolutely stunning.
5824,I'm not a mom.
5825,However.
5826,I like the dress so.... Yeah your bf can step on Lego
5827,He’s worth less than the dress.
5828,"Drop the dude and have fun at your prom enjoying the things you like, you earned them."
5829,If it makes you feel like a princess 👸🏻 DO IT.
5830,You look stunning
5831,The dress is beautiful and you look STUNNING in it.
5832,The boyfriend's manners and fashion sense?
5833,Not so much tho
5834,"Dad here, and 10 out of 10 Dad's agree, you have amazing taste, own that dress!"
5835,"It's really pretty sweetheart, every girl deserves to look like a princess at her prom!"
5836,"If you decide to still go to the dance with this boy, please make sure to get plenty of pictures with *just you* in addition to the usual couple's shots."
5837,"I dated the same boy all through highschool and a few years after and one big regret is that I don't have any pictures from homecomings, proms, graduation etc that don't feature him."
5838,"I am not going to tell you he is terrible because of one story, young men are not always known to be very tactful, but please make sure he knows that he is being hurtful and that you expect kindness from him."
5839,And do not allow a boy or man tell you what to wear.
5840,You are the boss of your own body.
5841,I hope you have so much fun!
5842,"Hey sis, you look incredible 💕 That dress flatters you at every angle and is so unique and beautiful!"
5843,I love the detail.
5844,"I am so sorry that your boyfriend said that to you, that was very harsh."
5845,"Remember that the dress is for you, not for anybody else."
5846,"If you feel beautiful (because you definitely are), then I would go stag or with some other friends."
5847,Sister here.
5848,"You look beautiful, and it’s so flattering on you."
5849,Your boyfriend is the issue.
5850,"The person you’re with should lift you up, not put you down and cause you to doubt yourself."
5851,Nah dont lie to the kid this shits a fuggin mess
5852,Jokes on your boyfriend this dress is hot
5853,"That dress is gorgeous, and you will look amazing in it!"
5854,"Time to shop for a new boyfriend who appreciates being with a stylish, self-confident woman."
5855,Next.
5856,Your dress is beautiful.
5857,The neckline is perfect the color goes extremely well with your skin tone and I love the detailing of the bodice.
5858,Your boyfriend is allowed to have whatever opinion he wants (even if incorrect!)
5859,but you will honestly look beautiful walking into your prom wearing that dress.
5860,Part of his comments may be his own insecurities.
5861,"Years from now you will look back at your pictures from prom and now all of us are right - that dress is perfect on you, is beautiful and is worth every penny."
5862,This is gorgeous.
5863,You look like a princess.
5864,Nah bro that junk slaps
5865,I think you look beautiful.. its a very elegant dress.
5866,That color is amazing!
5867,It’s gorg and you look amazing in it!
5868,Maybe the boyfriend needs glasses?
5869,🤩😎
5870,I think the dress looks lovely on you sweetheart.
5871,I would dump the jerk though.
5872,He's intentionally trying to make you feel bad about yourself.
5873,Don't fall for it.
5874,"Hey, sis."
5875,Sounds like he’s worried your beauty will get you more attention at prom than his ego can handle.
5876,Please wear what you feel like an absolute queen in.
5877,Never mute your self-expression for a boy.
5878,"My prom wasn’t all that long ago, and this was a common look then."
5879,You won’t be the odd one out.
5880,"You will look miraculous, and if that intimidates him, oh well."
5881,"He might not be a bad guy, but you look stunning and it’s really uncool that he made you feel like you don’t."
5882,He needs to mature a bit and learn to be proud of you
5883,"Big sis here: trust me, a real man would like you in any dress."
5884,Ditch the dude and have fun!
5885,I think you look like a princess
5886,It’s stunning on you.
5887,I love it!
5888,It’s very pretty.
5889,It’s maybe bordering on wedding dress with the lace appliqués.
5890,But it’s very very pretty.
5891,"As a 33 year old, your high school boyfriend should have exactly zero sway on your life."
5892,The dress is perfect!
5893,Tell that boyfriend of yours that if he doesn't have anything nice to say he shouldn't say anything.
5894,I love everything about this dress😍🤩😍
5895,This is beautiful!
5896,i dont hate it.
5897,it reminds me of some fantasy forest spirit!
5898,It’s lovely!

5904,Dont let a stupid boy tell you its bad.
5905,You rock the shit out this dress.
5906,THIS IS YOUR PROM TOO.
5907,"Not so much mom for a moment, but brother for a moment: that dress looks kickass on you."
5908,"The color choice is well fitting against your skin tone, and the white accentuations give it that little bit of extra pop!"
5909,"The shape works wonderfully, as well."
5910,It really is a beautiful dress!
5911,"Your boyfriend can stuff it, and learn to not invalidate your feelings."
5912,Go rock that dress and have a good time at prom :)
5913,I love that dress.
5914,I love love love it.
5915,I wish I had such a beautiful dress for my proms eons ago.
5916,Darling this momma thinks you’re gorge!
5917,"Keep the prom dress, drop the boyfriend."
5918,The dress is gorgeous!
5919,HOLY CRAP THOSE APPLICQUES...
5920,"THE OFF SHOULDER TWIST... it's an entirely garden chic/ modern take on a ""Cinderella"" gown and I love it."
5921,"it's stunning, he will be a former boyfriend very soon!"
5922,Wow!
5923,That is a STUNNING dress.
5924,The fine details on it are amazing.
5925,Look at that embroidery and beading!
5926,And that colour looks so good with your skin tone.
5927,You look amazing.
5928,The shape is beautiful.
5929,"Your boyfriend is WRONG, WRONG, WRONG."
5930,"Your dress looks flowery and amazing, your boyfriend is sounding like he needs some work though."
5931,You look beautiful and I hope you have a fun time at Prom
5932,The dress is absolutely gorgeous!
5933,It’s classy & fits you great!
5934,Wear what you feel comfortable in and rock that gorgeous gown!
5935,Feel free to dance with a few other nice fellas while you’re there.
5936,Have a great night!
5937,!
5938,I love it
5939,It’s gorgeous ❤️❤️
5940,It's your night too.
5941,And you went with this dress for a reason.
5942,It looks beautiful on you.
5943,"And I wore a big ass princess dress to prom and everyone complimented me bc all the other girls were wearing like cut out, body con, tight dresses."
5944,"Even at 18, my date had no idea how to even give an opinion on a prom dress."
5945,I also have 4 brothers who wouldn't have a freaking clue where to begin now as married adults.
5946,Lol.
5947,Don't let anyone make you second guess yourself.
5948,You're gonna look amazing and have a great time!
5949,Dump the guy.
5950,Keep the dress!
5951,Dress looks great.
5952,Anyone who sees you in it shouldn’t hate it and I would question why the feels are so strong.
5953,It fits well and is objectively neutral.
5954,I personally love growing plants and love the vine appearance that it gives off.
5955,He doesn't have to wear it...
5956,Get a new bf dawg
5957,It's a beautiful dress.
5958,"However, and I'm sure I'll get downvoted, it's definitely too old for a prom dress."
5959,This is more a 50 year olds mother-of-the-bride dress and not a 17 year olds prom dress.
5960,I teach high school.
5961,You're not going to fit in and will probably feel awkward all night.
5962,It is 100% your choice and you look good in it.
5963,But honest opinion after spending more than a decade teaching teenagers is that you have to be really okay standing out to wear this in front of 600 other teenagers.
5964,How beautiful!!
5965,Look at all the details on it!
5966,!
5967,Do you feel beautiful in the dress?
5968,"That boy may not be around in a few years, but your memories definitely will be."
5969,Honestly an elegant updo and a beautiful short decorative necklace would make this amazing!
5970,It’s all about the accessories!
5971,!
5972,I LOVE the beaded detail around the cuffs of the sleeve.
5973,"Idk what they're called, but that dress is beautiful and matches your skin tone perfectly."
5974,I hope you wear it.
5975,"Keep the dress, it’s beautiful."
5976,Get your money back on the boyfriend though.
5977,I’m not a mom but a guy and it’s a very pretty dress.
5978,Your new date should have no problem matchhing his tie!
5979,Big sis here.
5980,That dress is breathtaking.
5981,You’ll be the belle of prom.
5982,❤️😍
5983,"Baby, it’s beautiful."
5984,You are going to look like a queen.
5985,Dresses like this are once in a lifetime.
5986,"I never really liked your boyfriend, anyway."
5987,"We ain’t dressing for men in 2022, babes."
5988,Wear the absolute fuck out of that dress!
5989,Um that dress is gorgeous!!!
5990,!
5991,Well its your money and you like who cares what they think
5992,So pretty!
5993,"Fits well and is 1000% prom perfect

What is his problem?"
5994,What a stunning dress!!!!
5995,I love it!
5996,I disagree with the boyfriend.
5997,This looks great on you.
5998,Do you love it?
5999,Do you feel pretty in it?
6000,Does it make you feel like twirling a fucking twirl and smiling?
6001,"If yes, Then everyone else can fuck right off."
6002,I learned this lesson during my senior prom: a girl in my party made a comment that my “shoes don’t match my dress.” My dress was hot pink and had multi-colored floral beading all over.
6003,I had red shoes.
6004,They absolutely matched.
6005,"But she was a mean girl and I felt pretty and that was the first - in a long line - of thinking to myself, and accepting it, to fuck everyone else if you feel good."
6006,This is a beautiful dress!!!!!
6007,It’s very Princess like!
6008,Boys don’t know shit about dresses lol I’m sorry but fuck him and his negative opinion 🤣
6009,That dress is incredible!
6010,I especially love that line of beadwork.
6011,"If your boyfriend doesn't like it, he can kick rocks."
6012,Your boyfriend is a fucking prick.
6013,Dump his ass.
6014,-Dad
6015,"If you think it’s beautiful, wear it."
6016,I certainly think it is ❤️
6017,Iffy bf
6018,"You mean your EX boyfriend, right?"
6019,What??!
6020,That’s beautiful.
6021,Boys are dumb.
6022,Your dress is beautiful.
6023,"It fits you so well and it's really elegant, timeless."
6024,Your boyfriend is wrong.
6025,Dead wrong.
6026,As long as he doesn’t plan on wearing the dress I don’t think he has a say.
6027,Lol.
6028,The only thing that matters is that you love it.
6029,Can you imagine telling him that you didn’t like his tux?
6030,You look like a princess in that dress.
6031,Do you love it?
6032,That’s the only answer that matters.
6033,"Whoa now, let’s slow down recommending this young girl dump her boyfriend just before prom based on one post that assuredly does not demonstrate the entirety of their relationship."
6034,"First, cut the boy a little slack."
6035,"Adult men are not known for their tact, let alone teenage boys."
6036,"Second, boys/men can and do have opinions about fashion."
6037,"Lots of women don’t like these kinds of dresses, for lots of reasons."
6038,It’s not surprising that men would have similar opinions.
6039,I bet he was going for a form fitting dress for fairly obvious reasons.
6040,"And last, it is a normal part of any relationship, no matter the age, to deal with differences of opinion."
6041,I am sure most of us have some version of the “college couch” or “bunny onesie” that we love and our spouse wants to burn.
6042,But that couch is still in your basement and you still rock those pj’s.
6043,Why?
6044,Because there is a balancing act between how much you hate it and how much it means to them.
6045,But that always starts with communicating how you feel.
6046,"If he just states his opinion and didn’t descend into pressuring her or insulting her personally, then that’s ok. She can still choose to override him if she loves her dress and feels confident in it (it is lovely btw)."
6047,She can also decide that his opinion outweighs her feelings.
6048,Both are legitimate and dealing with conflict in a respectful manner is a good life lesson.
6049,"Again, though, if he was super rude or demanding, that is different and she should totally throw him out with the bath water."
6050,"She didn’t indicate I her post that he had gone that far, so I am not going to immediately crucify the poor boy for having the gall to be honest with her."
6051,That’s really all we know here.
6052,"Never, ever, ever, let someone make you feel bad when your felt beautiful."
6053,Especially someone who is supposed to care about you.
6054,"Ditch the no hood boyfriend, go to prom with a group of friends and dance your butt off, I promise you it will be more fun anyway."
6055,"And just so you know, I think the dress is absolutely stunning."
6056,And it reminds me of one of my dream wedding dresses I wasn’t able to buy due to cost.
6057,Don’t you let that funky boy get you down.
6058,What the hell does he know anyway?
6059,Let him gooooo let him goooooooo
6060,"Everyone wants an honest guy, til they get one."
6061,"That dress is ugly, lol."
6062,"Reddit says to leave your bf, I think you should keep him, he might keep you looking good."
6063,Good luck!
6064,"Oh my gosh, look at you!!!"
6065,You’re STUNNING!!
6066,"That color is so lovely with your skin tone, and I looooove the beading and lace!!"
6067,And you could wear gold OR silver with it!
6068,Listen to me.
6069,"You need to tell your boyfriend that while you appreciate his opinion, he hurt your feelings and he needs to be more considerate."
6070,"The dress isn’t for him, it’s for you."
6071,"If he wants to dress you up, HE can take you shopping and pay for it."
6072,"Do not waste your time on boys/people who disrespect you like that, EVER."
6073,Please keep this BEAUTIFUL dress and wear it with pride!
6074,"If your boyfriend gives you attitude, go without him and dance with your friends!"
6075,You look like a princess!!
6076,!
6077,"I know you asked your mom, but if I can give a father's opinion, I also think you're a beautiful daughter and that dress looks lovely on you."
6078,Don't worry too much about what one boy thinks.
6079,I hope you can still go to prom and have a lot of fun with everyone else who is there to enjoy their time and celebrate.
6080,I would have loved I have a dress like this for prom!
6081,Absolutely beautiful.
6082,It’s lovely and I respectfully disagree with his opinion.
6083,Oh you should definitely return it.
6084,Hopefully you kept a receipt.
6085,I would have a friend help you as carrying a malfunctioning boyfriend into the return line can be rather strenuous.
6086,"All jokes aside you look great, that color really compliments your skin tone and your boyfriend is an idiot."
6087,Rock that dress sweetheart ❤
6088,This is giving fairy princess dream!!
6089,I love it!
6090,!
6091,I think the dress is absolutely lovely on you and matches your eyes… If he is going to be that critical about your dress… I think you could finish that sentence…Have a happy prom and don’t forget to make your bed
6092,The dress is *gorgeous*.
6093,"When I was your age (sorry for the cliche), my boyfriend dumped me over my choice to wear heels to prom."
6094,"Spent the night living it up, enjoying it with friends, and not his negativity."
6095,"No reason to regret, you picked a lovely dress and as long as you love it, that's all that matters."
6096,"Do have fun at prom, dear."
6097,It looks beautiful on you.
6098,Enjoy your prom.
6099,Find a new boyfriend.
6100,Or just find yourself and enjoy your life.
6101,Have fun at prom.
6102,You are beautiful.
6103,I think your dress is brilliant.
6104,"It has fabrics that scatter light, but because of the combination of layers, it looks like a fluorite mineral."
6105,This dress is gorgeous!
6106,Boyfriend probably doesn't  have an outfit to match this dress or he'd prefer you don't make it so easy for people to see that you're too good for him.
6107,It’s gorgeous.
6108,This is a great opportunity to make yourself feel beautiful.
6109,My husband dislikes lots of my clothes but I feel good in them and there will always be someone that has different taste than you.
6110,Rock that dress like the queen you are!
6111,"I am a dad, and I think it looks great."
6112,You’re looking glorious!
6113,The first thing I thought was that you look like a princess!
6114,I like it cause it's unique from what you expect from the stereotypical image that's suppose to be bland.
6115,"Though for a male who is young, they must think it's grandma's dress"
6116,The dress is gorgeous!
6117,And it looks amazing on you!
6118,Your boyfriend has NO sense of style!
6119,Who cares what he thinks.
6120,Do YOU like it?
6121,"If so, get out and have fun."
6122,I think it’s stunning!
6123,"It may be different from what the other girls wear (straight formal dresses are more common than ones with some volume), but that doesn’t mean yours isn’t beautiful!"
6124,I love the choice.
6125,This dress is fucking stunning.
6126,"That boyfriend is just wrong, mm-mm."
6127,Just remember that neither of you will care about any of this in a few years.
6128, Dump your boyfriend + Ugly dress can both be true.
6129,I can’t find my original comment to edit it but I showed my bf and he said “is that dude stupid?
6130,It’s a princess dress!
6131,Of course you wear it to prom!”
6132,I am going to be honest you look like a quinceañera.
6133,If no one else is wearing such dress don’t do it.
6134,Kids are mean… they will talk about you
6135,Darling your dress looks amazing!
6136,Wish I could have worn it to my prom.
6137,This is a fairytale dress.
6138,I adore it.
6139,Don't let someone take  your joy from you.
6140,Wear the dress and take lots of pictures.
6141,❤️❤️❤️
6142,That’s so pretty!
6143,When I went to prom I bought a purple and blue cheetah print dress.
6144,And I LOVED it.
6145,No one else liked it and my bf ended up breaking up with me a week before prom.
6146,To this date it’s still my favorite dress.
6147,"I low key think my cheetah print dress is ugly AF now, but the joy I felt from that dress was my favorite memory."
6148,Only opinion that matters is yours girl.
6149,Lovely dress but would suit a 1950’s prom.
6150,Just sayin😊
6151,Looks the the dress you wear to your cousins coronation.
6152,Sorry honey might look for something simpler next time.
6153,Dad chiming in if it matters.
6154,Boyfriend gets no say.
6155,"He matches you, not the other way around."
6156,Dress is gorgeous.
6157,Looks great on you!
6158,"Worst case scenario, dump him, keep the dress, get a date with a better head on his shoulders."
6159,Have a blast at prom!
6160,"Lose the purple bracelet, get a sparkly necklace, do yourself up, and go to prom."
6161,It's pretty and you'll look great.
6162,This dress is perfection.
6163,I wish the dresses were this beautiful when I had prom.
6164,I think you should return the boyfriend and get a better one
6165,the dress is lovely.
6166,It’s gorgeous!!
6167,!
6168,Totally beautiful & unique too!
6169,I would question a partner who does not value individuality.
6170,"If he wants a girl who looks like everyone else, then he can go find her."
6171,It's a lovely color and a lovely shape and ya look pretty good innit (tho u do need to own a stance of an outfit u own by pulling the line of your spine towards the sky and rolling your shoulders back to their natural state).
6172,Invest little energy into anyone that doesnt appreciate you in a cardboard box but to be fair maybe he is experimenting with being a jerk to get personal power as he might have never had any.
6173,Tell him no thanks on his unhelpful opinion and do whatcha like.
6174,I like it
6175,It’s very unique and looks amazing on you!!
6176,Don’t let anyone steal your joy
6177,love it
6178,Gorgeous!!
6179,Enjoy your prom.
6180,BF obviously doesn't know what he is talking about.
6181,You can tell him you have  thousands of siblings and cousins who would like a word.
6182,I would describe you dress as exquisite.
6183,I love everything about it.
6184,I actually love it!
6185,Goodness!
6186,I absolutely love it.
6187,"So elegant, classy, beautifully understated color."
6188,And you look great in it!
6189,I personally think it's a lovely dress.
6190,"The details are beautiful, and the cut of the dress is flattering on you."
6191,I really love the embroidery!
6192,"More importantly: When you put it on, you felt like a million bucks."
6193,You felt beautiful and confident.
6194,Then he opened his mouth and took that power away from you.
6195,"If he doesn't like it, then he can buy his own dress and wear it to the prom."
6196,"If he didn't pay for it and isn't going to wear it, he can keep his opinion to himself."
6197,Make sure to get plenty of photos solo or just with your friends.
6198,"In group shots, make sure he's at the very edge of the picture."
6199,(Just future planning.)
6200,Dress is beautiful I love the detail and you must of picked it because you loved how you felt in it.
6201,I would perhaps reflect on your boyfriends attitude and ability to make you feel so bad about the dress.
6202,"People regardless of boyfriend, friend, or other status should lift you and not pull you down."
6203,"Even if it wasn't pretty, which it is, your boyfriend should keep his mouth shut."
6204,What a douche.
6205,The dress is fine.
6206,Your boyfriend is a dummy
6207,Sweetie it’s gorgeous and so are you!
6208,Your boyfriend is a jerk
6209,You look beautiful
6210,Time to go stag.
6211,And be sure everyone knows why.
6212,Dump your boyfriend
6213,Looks gorgeous!
6214,"Your bf isn't wearing the dress, you are so hos opinion is meaningless."
6215,Also he's got terrible taste
6216,Its a beautiful dress and you should wear rhe hell out if it.
6217,Looking like Cinderella
6218,The dress is gorgeous.
6219,would look so good with a curly up do and sparkly light white eye shadow and a pink lip!
6220,kind a like a winter princess vibe.
6221,totally works for prom!
6222,"Lose the boy, keep the dress."
6223,You look beautiful
6224,Keep the dress.
6225,Lose the bf.
6226,Never let anybody make you feel less.
6227,"It's hard to stand up for yourself, I speak from experience, but once you practice a few times, it gets easier."
6228,Reminds me of frozen
6229,If the boyfriend is noticing the dress and not you...get a new boyfriend that will appreciate you!
6230,The dress looks great.
6231,You chose it and someone else’s opinion shouldn’t alter you being happy about it.
6232,You and your boyfriend are young.
6233,Just kindly explain to him that you like it and you can respect that he doesn’t like it but it’s too late now so we should just put it aside and enjoy the evening.
6234,Being mature about it makes it to where it doesn’t affect or spoil the evening.
6235,That is such a beautiful dress.
6236,This is your prom night don't let him ruin it.
6237,It's stunning.
6238,Lose the boy he doesn't go with that dress.
6239,Beautiful dress and beautiful fit!
6240,Remember how you loved it when you bought it?
6241,Find people in your life who help you live in that feeling longer.
6242,Good luck!
6243,And have fun at prom!
6244,your boyfriend has a weird taste in clothing I presume.
6245,you look great in that dress.
6246,"It's gorgeous 🥰, and you are too."
6247,Be the princess you are inside and out for prom.
6248,Dress for you not him.
6249,This looks amazing on you!!!
6250,Don't let anyone talk down about something you chose and bought.
6251,All you might have to do is change your date?
6252,Rock it.
6253,It's lovely.
6254,Hang it in your closet and keep it for 40 years.
6255,"Even though you may never put it on again, you will see it every so often and remember what it was like to be equally insecure and beautiful at the same time."
6256,Boyfriend needs to rent a tux to keep up and is bitching about it.
6257,Have fun.
6258,It's your night.
6259,Girlfriend says the dress doesn’t fit your complexion and the shape makes you look “boxy” idk.
6260,I think it looks fine
6261,It does not look particularly 'age appropriate' (looks like something an older person would wear).
6262,You might ask if there's a way to alter the dress to make it more suitable for someone in their late teens.
6263,"Having said that, you should do you!"
6264,Even if the dress is shit he should stfu and for what it's worth it's fine.
6265,super beautiful.
6266,don’t second guess it.
6267,Your dress is beautiful!
6268,I think it’s beautiful!
6269,But what’s important is how you feel when you wear it.
6270,Do you feel good?
6271,Confidant?
6272,Beautiful dress!
6273,It’s beautiful.
6274,You have so few chances in life to wear a ball gown.
6275,I wouldn’t pass up this one.
6276,"Lol, whatever you do don't take dating advice from reddit.....They're some of the most self absorbed and unhappy people on the planet....all the ""jokes"" about being single and wanting to due should tell you that this isn't the place to seek advice.....preferably get advice from people that actually know you and if you can, know both of you, those are the people who's opinion you should be listening too, not random redditors with mental health and constant interpersonal drama."
6277,that dress is sick
6278,The dress is beautiful and very flattering 💖
6279,Oh my gosh that color looks amazing against your skin and that design is beautiful.
6280,Don't regret anything!
6281,"Showed your pics to my 23yo son and he thought it was a beautiful dress and looked lovely on you (and so do I, btw!)."
6282,<3
6283,You look like Cinderella!!
6284,!
6285,You look fabulous!
6286,I'm a trans man and I would gladly wear that dress.
6287,Also I'm your brother now and I'm willing to throw hands if he causes you grief.
6288,"Baby doll, everything from the color to the cut to the details makes you look like a dream."
6289,"You will be the Cinderella walking into that prom, and it’s his decision whether he’s Prince Charming or if he’s the pumpkin in the parking lot."
6290,Right now?
6291,He’s lookin’ PRETTY orange.
6292,Oh my that is stunning!
6293,How gorgeous!
6294,It’s fine.
6295,Nobody will care anyway.
6296,"Honey, that dress is GORGEOUS!!!"
6297,You look amazing and I hope you have a wonderful time at prom
6298,"Auntie here says that is a lovely, well-fitted, perfectly prom appropriate dress!"
6299,It looks elegant but still young and fun!
6300,Concentrate instead on eating right and exercising.
6301,"It's absolutely gorgeous, and it fits beautifully."
6302,That's a beautiful dress!
6303,I have a similar one saved that's white that I would love to use on my wedding day.
6304,It's just such a nice style.
6305,Not to mention it looks like it fits you perfectly.
6306,That is a beautiful dress.
6307,Truly a princess dress.
6308,Classy yet it clings in the right places.
6309,You’re showing that you have a beautiful & very feminine figure without losing any of the grace & elegance.
6310,I love it!
6311,Absolutely beautiful.
6312,I looove this dress.
6313,So elegant with a strong vintage vibe.
6314,I love the way the straps fold over.
6315,It reminds me of Grace Kelly.
6316,10 years from now you’ll be looking back at this and appreciating the decision you made.
6317,This is a timeless classic.
6318,You do you and if he can’t appreciate you for who you are then that is his problem.
6319,"Honestly honey, your boyfriend is a dick."
6320,This is a lovely dress.
6321,He doesn’t get to police your clothes.
6322,I went to prom with my best friend.
6323,He didn’t like my dress.
6324,He was also an hour late to get me.
6325,"We’re not friends anymore, because I deserved to be treated better."
6326,You do too!
6327,Go to your prom with someone who cares more about you than what you wear.
6328,Oh honey you look like a princess!!
6329,It looks so good
6330,you’re dress is beautiful!!!
6331,drop the bf who is dragging you down
6332,"Love it

Beautiful colour 

Looks great on you 

If the boyfriend doesn’t like it he can shut the pie hole and buy his own dress"
6333,I think it’s pretty 😊
6334,This dress is stunning and you look amazing
6335,I love it …
6336,Holy crap these comments!
6337,"The guy just gave his opinion on the dress, what's wrong with that?"
6338,You would have this girl dump her boyfriend just because he doesn't like a dress??
6339,Or you would prefer that he lies to her?
6340,"Are you ""allowed"" to give *your* honest opinion to your SO, or do you just always say whatever they picked is perfect?"
6341,"Do you think it's wrong for *you* to tell your SO a shirt doesn't look good, or their pants aren't a good match?"
6342,Oh sweetie it's so pretty!
6343,You look amazing.
6344,I'm sorry that boy doesn't agree.
6345,Rethink that relationship.
6346,You deserve to be cherished.
6347,It doesn’t have what media he consumed put in his head is a good prom outfit.
6348,That dress is gorgeous.
6349,It's fabulous and so are you!
6350,You look like a princess it’s beautiful 😍 Please don’t listen to him love you look incredible!
6351,You look like Cinderella.
6352,:3
6353,I don't know what to say- your boyfriend is just plain wrong.
6354,Tell your man if he doesn't like it maybe you should find someone who does.
6355,I love it!
6356,This dress caught my eye while I was scrolling.
6357,I read the caption and was shocked.
6358,It’s stunning and elegant.
6359,This dress is so elegant.
6360,The boy doesn't understand elegance.
6361,Tell him to take his ull-fitting rental suit and get lost till he finds some class.
6362,"Absolutely gorgeous dress, hun!"
6363,"It’s gorgeous, you look like a modern live action Cinderella in a very good way"
6364,Your boyfriend is a dingus.
6365,This dress is so beautiful
6366,No freaking way!
6367,This is the dress I think I’ve always wanted!
6368,It’s perfect and I’m not just saying it - I really mean it.
6369,It’s stunning!
6370,I appreciate that you want to look like a beautiful young lady and not a Kardashian.
6371,I’ve seen some other prom dresses lately and .. yikes.
6372,Super short and super tight.
6373,They look more like something a 22 year old would wear to go out clubbing.
6374,Maybe he’s upset you didn’t go that route.
6375,"If that’s the case, ditch him!"
6376,"Imma be honest lil mama, fuck homeboy’s opinion and the thought of his existence"
6377,I went to prom in a way-too-expensive dress that we couldn’t afford by myself.
6378,And I have no regrets.
6379,It’s more fun with your friends anyway.
6380,I think you should go to prom in that dress and leave the boyfriend at home.
6381,You look like Cinderella.
6382,I love it
6383,"You look like a fucking princess, wow!"
6384,That color is great on you.
6385,no i really like it
6386,I love it!
6387,That dress is fire 🔥
6388,I don’t know what Mom said but the dress is gorgeous and looks incredible on you 🤯
6389,It's gorgeous!
6390,And does he not know that the dress is for YOU and NOT FOR HIM?!
6391,He is being a little bratty I think.
6392,It’s beautiful!!!
6393,Sorry your BF was a jerk.
6394,It’s absolutely beautiful.
6395,It’s beyond elegant.
6396,It's absolutely stunning honey.
6397,And so are you.
6398,💗
6399,Genuinely this is absolutely gorgeous.
6400,Fabulous color for you and I'm absolutely in love with the detailing and embroidery.
6401,Shame on the boy for being so rude and judgy on something he clearly knows nothing about.
6402,I think it looks magical.
6403,BF can hush.
6404,This post is going to need an update picture come prom time!
6405,Can’t wait to see how beautiful you look!
6406,🥰
6407,Modern day Cinderella
6408,That dress looks perfect on you.
6409,Your boyfriend is just being negative for the sake of it.
6410,Dont let him ruin a dress you love.
6411,"If he can’t appreciate it or you, he’s not worth your time."
6412,"Live your life for you, not for anyone else or their opinions"
6413,Your boyfriend is a jerk.
6414,The dress is lovely.
6415,"My dear, your gown is stunning, as are you in it!"
6416,"Don't allow anyone, especially not a teenaged boy diminish your joy!!"
6417,You are absolutely beautiful!!
6418,Enjoy every moment of prom!
6419,!
6420,That dress is amazing!
6421,You look great in it and is so unique!
6422,He’s wrong you look like the queen you are!
6423,"Not a mother, not even a woman, don't know how I got here."
6424,"What I do know is, that you look wonderful straight up princess status, and that dress is beautiful, you'll look stunning at prom and have a wonderful time making great memories."
6425,"And speaking as a fairly young man myself, your boyfriend is a dick and you'd do well to get rid, go with friends Instead if you have to, way more fun anyway."
6426,Never let others detract from your happiness.
6427,It’s beautiful!
6428,You look gorgeous!
6429,"The colour, the neckline, the beading.. it’s perfect!"
6430,It's ugly
6431,"Sweetheart, you look like a damn princess."
6432,Literally fairy tale perfect.
6433,If I had a time machine I’d be asking to borrow that dress for 17 year old me.
6434,"It’s elegant, timeless, gorgeous."
6435,You could literally go to a prom in any era and be the belle of the ball.
6436,"As someone else said, your boyfriend has great taste in girls since he chose you, but he has appalling taste in clothes."
6437,What the heck does he know about dresses and since when is he the dress police instead being thrilled he has a lovely date for prom ?
6438,"He can zip his mouth, and he has bad taste."
6439,"Who picked his outfit, tux store ?"
6440,Maybe with immaculate hair and makeup.
6441,"But honestly, I'm not feeling the dress."
6442,It's too brides maid's ish.
6443,Looks kinda outdated.
6444,What a pretty dress!
6445,"Wear it, enjoy it, dump his ass!"
6446,!
6447,It looks amazing!!
6448,!
6449,That is a perfectly lovely dress.
6450,You have boy issues not dress issues.
6451,I went stag to senior prom and had way more fun without the boy drama!
6452,"It doesnt matter if the dress is beautiful, it matters how the dress makes you feel."
6453,"Anyone who would/should date you shouldnt care what youre wearing, only that youre happy."
6454,Which is good...because that is not an attractive piece of clothing.
6455,Hey sis!
6456,"The dress is great, your boyfriend seems really inconsiderate and rude for making you feel insecure about your clothing choices."
6457,"Enjoy your prom, you truely look like a princess and should get to feel like one and if your boyfriend would rather make you feel bad he has no place in your life."
6458,Its like a granny panty prom dress.
6459,"He wants a hot girl, like the kind that paint their toenails white"
6460,You and the dress look beautiful.
6461,"The boyfriend, on the other hand, is too tight on you."
6462,I'd get rid of him and get you a man who fits better ❤️
6463,"As someone who loves hating on fashion choices, I really quite like this dress."
6464,A white/silver necklace would pair well.
6465,"Also, the sooner you learn to let go of judgement, the happier you will be."
6466,I learned that later than I wish.
6467,"Keep the dress, return the boyfriend."
6468,That is a beautiful dress.
6469,"your boyfriend is either dumb, lame or both."
6470,When I was in high school I couldn't have cared less what dress my date wore to the dance.
6471,"I was just happy I had a date and knew I would have a good time with them because they were a quality person, also maybe if I played my cards right good things might happen."
6472,your chuckle buddy boyfriend doesn't seem to grasp that last point because he's setting himself up for failure.
6473,"You do you boo, I'm sure you'll look great and even better with confidence knowing you look great in the dress that you picked out."
6474,"The dresses a lot of people are wearing to the prom are going to be dresses that they love, but they will be products of their time."
6475,Think big shoulders in the 80’s.
6476,Your dress is very elegant and very timeless.
6477,"Also, there’s no such thing as “too much” when it comes to prom."
6478,It’s freaking prom.
6479,You deserve better than that boyfriend.
6480,This dress is so pretty!!!!
6481,I’m sorry that your boyfriend wasn’t supportive.
6482,I think it looks really lovely.
6483,I would think about what drew you to this dress in the first place and make a decision that way instead of thinking about what someone else thinks about it.
6484,"At the end of the day, you would be wearing it, not your boyfriend and you deserve to feel pretty and confident at prom."
6485,Did your boyfriend say what they didn’t like about it?
6486,Like if it had to do with the neckline you could wear a shawl (I know it’s not super modern but it’s what my mom always recommended when I was younger).
6487,"(I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the neckline mind you, I just couldn’t think of another reason they might have an issue with this dress.)"
6488,"Keep the dress, dump the boyfriend."
6489,I love it 😍 you’ll look amazing!
6490,"As long as you’re happy, that’s all that matters."
6491,"Listen closely.. this is a lesson that I learned only recently and I wish I had known this at your age: love yourself, don’t live to please others, and lastly, if a man doesn’t appreciate you exactly how you are, let him go."
6492,"You are perfect just as you are, and the right one will see that."
6493,Change yourself for no one but yourself.
6494,Have fun at prom love!
6495,This is a very memorable time of your life.
6496,"This young man is giving off red flags, but I do understand he’s young and maybe doesn’t know better."
6497,"This isn’t saying he’s a bad person, but don’t get too invested."
6498,You’re young and have a lot of life to live.
6499,Don’t let a boy or man or anyone else dim your light.
6500,That reminds me of my prom dress!
6501,I love it and it looks great!
6502,It is a beautiful dress!
6503,!
6504,I would say that the colour could’ve been more vibrant or something but other than that it’s a nice dress
6505,That dress is amazing!
6506,Your boyfriend is insane.
6507,"You need a new boyfriend 🤷

The women makes the dress, the dress doesn't make the woman.🥻👗 👑👸"
6508,Good looking girl
6509,"GIrl, no."
6510,I had a boyfriend or two that  would critque my clothing choices and it expanded into my tv shows and the hobbies I likes and then the places I enjoyed... Just... no.
6511,Turns out they didn't like me at all so I don't know why they wanted to date me in the first place.
6512,Keep a watch on that kind of behavior.
6513,"If it keeps going, make him gone."
6514,Thicccc
6515,The dress is great.
6516,He might be being a dick cause he's insecure how good you look in the dress
6517,That dress is super flattering on you!
6518,"And trust me, this dress works perfectly for an occasion like this."
6519,One girl wore a dress with a massively poofy skirt (think princess) for my prom and it looked like a lot fun.
6520,I think it’s classy and beautiful!
6521,I love it.
6522,I love the embroidery.
6523,I like fashion.
6524,Dope dress.
6525,Fiancés was the same color.
6526,"No, sweetheart, your dress has a classically innocent appeal to it that you wear beautifully."
6527,Could the reason your boyfriend doesn't like your dress possibly be because he feels unworthy?
6528,Or possibly because he doesn't have extra money with which to impress you?
6529,Talk to him about it..
6530,It's beautiful sweetie.
6531,"Tell him it's not the clothes that matters, it's me."
6532,Do you not care for me?
6533,Absolutely gorgeous!
6534,Elsa from frozen vibes
6535,The dress is lovely.
6536,Classy.
6537,I meanwhile wore a black velvet suit with a black shirt and red bow tie.
6538,Thought I was the shit too
6539,This dress is so flattering on you and soooo beautiful.
6540,I love the details!
6541,"My dear, you look absolutely beautiful in that dress, and I have no doubt you're going to feel like a princess at prom."
6542,"For many, prom is a one time thing, so why not dress for what makes YOU feel best; screw anyone else's opinion."
6543,"Wear the dress, feel your best, and relish in knowing you look fantastic!"
6544,"From 0 to 10 I give it 8, but everyone has different taste, with a good hair style and fittings jewelry/accessories, you will look perfect."
6545,What?!
6546,That is so pretty and fits you so well!
6547,Boyfriend is being stupid.
6548,you look like a princess!
6549,!
6550,What a beautiful color and fit for you!
6551,"Not exactly female, but your bf can stuff it."
6552,That is a gorgeous dress and wear it with pride!
6553,If he doesn't like it then he can get you a new dress himself!
6554,the dress looks beautiful!
6555,Never got to have my prom because of covid and definitely wanted to go for a princess esque dress if i did!
6556,so i’m jealous af at the dress!
6557,however what’s not cute is a boyfriend who makes you feel insecure and doesn’t appreciate beauty because he’s too stuck on what others might think (saw ur comment on his reasons for hating it)!
6558,girly make those kids drop dead at your beauty and live the royal life you deserve with that dress!
6559,"I was scrolling and though this dress was from one of the sewing subreddits, and thought ""holy shit, that is AMAZING"" then I read that you were second guessing it, and with the number of comments here I hope you see that your taste is exceptional."
6560,"Follow what brings you that life fulfilling joy, both in fashion and in relationships and you'll never go wrong."
6561,Enjoy your prom!!
6562,We are all rooting for you to have a wonderful time <3
6563,"Unless he’s the one wearing it, he needs to keep his mouth shut."
6564,"You like it, it looks great, keep the dress, ditch the boyfriend."
6565,"I don’t understand partners having an opinion on choices about someone’s body, hair, clothes, makeup etc."
6566,A family friend had long thick hair that she hated but would never cut because her husband is an insecure “manly” guy and would throw a fit if she did.
6567,And she couldn’t wear heels because he’s short.
6568,"Outside of major life choices in a relationship, do/wear what your comfortable with."
6569,"No, sweetheart, you just need to return the boyfriend soon so you can still get your refund."
6570,🖤
6571,"The blue compliments your skin tone, and also, it's really pretty on you."
6572,:)
6573,I think a different dress would look better on you for prom.
6574,This is a great dress but It looks like your getting ready for a ball.
6575,Maybe some more sequins less flowers.
6576,Great shape for the dress though.
6577,"I know you’re asking for a mom, but this is your sister — your boyfriend is wrong, period."
6578,You look like Bridgerton/Cinderella and it’s AMAZING.
6579,Tell him to get a matching bow tie or to GTFO!
6580,YOURE SO CUTE!!!
6581,I LOVE IT!
6582,!
6583,big sis here.
6584,I absolutely love it.
6585,he's being a jerk.
6586,I love it!!
6587,It looks gorgeous on you too!
6588,Your boyfriend is a nimrod idiot he can’t see that…
6589,"That is a beautiful dress, and you look beautiful in it!"
6590,"OMG, the beadwork!"
6591,"What's most important, though, is that *you* like it."
6592,"Him not being happy simply that *you* like the dress you are wearing to prom is *his* problem, not yours."
6593,He has his own outfit that he can control (and do you negatively opine on *his* clothing choices?).
6594,He ought to be more supportive.
6595,"That he's not should give you serious doubts about *him*, not your dress."
6596,Dad here.
6597,"It's beautiful, sweetie."
6598,That boy has no taste.
6599,you look like cinderella!!!!
6600,- from a professional buyer at a really popular retail brand
6601,He’s a beta.
6602,Get out of there.
6603,"It’s beautiful, choose a dress you love and feel good in."
6604,Choose the dress dear.
6605,Replace your date.
6606,It would be better you go alone than with some with such bad taste or so unsupportive
6607,What an incredibly elegant gown!
6608,You deserve someone mature enough to appreciate it 😉
6609,WHAT it looks so good.
6610,Throw the boyfriend away.
6611,That dress is beautiful!
6612,"You'll be gorgeous in it, and if your boyfriend is telling you he doesn't like it, then I don't think his taste is worth taking into account."
6613,"And even if he doesn't like the dress, telling you that you look beautiful in it, and that your confidence makes you glow could have been a really easy win for him, but he chose to put you down and criticise your taste instead."
6614,"Choose the dress that makes you feel great, not the boyfriend who makes you doubt yourself."
6615,I hope you have a great time at prom!
6616,No.
6617,It’s perfectly lovely.
6618,The color looks good with your skin and it fits nicely.
6619,Your boyfriend can go suck an egg.
6620,It's very classic Disney.
6621,"If it makes you feel beautiful, who cares what others say?"
6622,It's gorgeous!
6623,The colour and the shape are stunning.
6624,Please allow yourself to feel beautiful in it!
6625,"Oh honey, the dress is gorgeous!"
6626,you look stunning!
6627,The dress is beautiful!
6628,It's gorgeous and the colour compliments you so well  please don't let your boyfriend take away your happiness from you.
6629,"If you feel gorgeous and pretty and beautiful in this dress, who is he to take it away from you?"
6630,The dress is beautiful.
6631,"He is a jerk, time to get a new one."
6632,"I think the Bf has bad taste, I dig that dress!"
6633,"Keep dress, get rid of boyfriend"
6634,There's a chance your bf was wanting you to look sexy.
6635,Not beautiful.
6636,This dress is beautiful and don't let his perspective on how it needs to look be pushed on you.
6637,"It may be worth considering going to prom with your friends, not him."
6638,It looks amazing!
6639,"Your may want to rethink your bf, though."
6640,He sounds like a jerk.
6641,You look like a princess!!
6642,"Keep the dress, throw out the whole boyfriend."
6643,elsa?
6644,I think that is a beautiful dress.
6645,"Great color, perfect fit."
6646,Don’t know what your BF is thinking!
6647,That is a stunning dress and it looks amazing on you!
6648,The dress is lovely and you look like a modern day Cinderella in it!
6649,I love the color!
6650,I don't know why he thinks it's wrong for Prom.
6651,"From my experience, it's exactly the kind of dress you'd wear to this event."
6652,"I think there's a trend to wear cocktail dresses to prom and that's what he's thinking of, but IMO, those just aren't fancy enough."
6653,"The whole point of prom is to dress up fancy and look your best, and the boy wears a tuxedo or special suit."
6654,Your boyfriend doesn't know what he's talking about.
6655,"Keep the dress, get a new boyfriend."
6656,Tbh I’m a guy and it looks kindof bad.
6657,Don’t listen to these single ladies.
6658,They just want you to be single.
6659,He should make himself good for you just as you should make yourself for him!!
6660,If he likes a different colour ask him but he should also ask for your opinion.
6661,Communication is key 🔐
6662,"Dude, you could be wearing a skinned goat and your boyfriend should still tell you its beautiful."
6663,Tf is he doing.
6664,"(As an impartial third party, I think it looks nice.)"
6665,"Keep the dress, lose the bf."
6666,You look gorgeous
6667,"Oh, honey - you have great taste in dresses."
6668,Sounds like you’re taste in dates needs some work.
6669,That’s ok.
6670,Learn as you go.
6671,In time you’ll be looking fabulous next to someone who appreciates style & grace.
6672,That dress is stunning!
6673,I’m getting Bridgerton vibes!
6674,The dude gotta go tho.
6675,Don’t regret it!
6676,Wear it and have fun!
6677,You’ll look great!
6678,That's really damn nice wear the dress
6679,Oh my fucking god.
6680,That dress is amazing.
6681,I wish I had a reason to wear something like that.
6682,It looks beautiful on you.
6683,10/10.
6684,Your bf hates this gorgeous dress?
6685,Is he blind ??
6686,?
6687,Your dress is stunning and seems to fit you very well.
6688,Maybe take a moment to ask your bf why he doesn't like the dress.
6689,Hopefully he will have some good insight into his own feeling and reactions and you can have a meaningful conversation about it.
6690,UM!
6691,"I'm sorry, what issue does he have with going to prom with **a real-life Disney princess**?"
6692,"Keep the dress, and if he doesn't start acting right, then start shopping for a new prom date (or just go stag, or do what i did and take a good friend as a date)."
6693,You deserve to *feel* as beautiful as you look in that dress on prom night!
6694,beautiful dress!
6695,It’s beautiful!
6696,It fits you well.
6697,You look amazing.
6698,The problem here is the prom date 👎🏼.
6699,You’re going to look spectacular at prom!!
6700,!
6701,I never went to prom but this is beautiful!
6702,I love it.
6703,If your date can’t see how great this dress is find someone who will!
6704,Hell going alone is better then being under/unappreciated.
6705,Great choice I love it!
6706,I mean your dress wear as you please.
6707,Honestly it matters way less on how good it looks than you think it should matter.
6708,"Imo as a male and apparently opposite of most people here, yes it is ugly."
6709,"Bad color, and I never have liked dresses that poof out at the bottom."
6710,"That said, I would tell ym date she looks great and move on, cause it doesn't matter."
6711,"Fuck his opinion, he is an idiot."
6712,Choose education.
6713,The dress you chose is fine.
6714,Omg that dress is PERFECT!
6715,"You look stunning, the shape, colour, embroidery, everything suits you (and that’s what matters!)"
6716,it fits perfectly!
6717,That dress is beautiful.
6718,"It fits you perfectly, and so many elements are exquisite: the beading, the neckline, the shoulder."
6719,You look like a princess.
6720,That dress flatters you to no end!
6721,"Really, how could you pick out a more beautiful dress?"
6722,And the color is perfect for your color.
6723,You did a really good job picking it out.
6724,"Some teenage boys just have no clue, and your bf is one of them."
6725,"In a few year, you will look back and laugh at yourself for even considering his uninformed opinion."
6726,You have every reason to be confident and enjoy prom.
6727,"Not Mom am Dad, the dress looks wonderful."
6728,As someone who was once a teenage boy let me say we're often really dumb.
6729,"Don't ever let a dumb teenage boy influence your opinions on what you like and don't like, you'll end up happier if you do you."
6730,There is nothing wrong with that dress.
6731,Period.
6732,Looks fine but it looks like you’re going to your quince
6733,It’s a beautiful gown and as long as you feel beautiful and maybe most importantly comfortable in it let the go kick rocksing commence.
6734,The dress is stunning!
6735,You should rather regret your boyfriend....
6736,That dress really isn't my personal style..
6737,BUT it's a beautiful color and it fits you SO perfectly!
6738,I think your boyfriend should just let you feel like a Princess.
6739,"If he doesn't, there's a million other people who would."
6740,You look like a fairy princess in that <3
6741,"I'm not mom, just a passerby dad but the dress is beautiful and so are you."
6742,"Confidence will define you, and this is your moment."
6743,"Not at prom, but in life."
6744,"You might show up as the only Cinderella at a prom full of black skin tight short dresses, but when you own it you'll never regret it, never!"
6745,It’s wonderful very regal!
6746,With matching earrings and a necklace it’s very nice.
6747,"He should just get a matching vest and love it also.🌹 sorry he’s not very nice (hug) you look great 

 I’m a mom glad I could be for a minute also."
6748,Trust your self on the dress 👗 and your hair also.
6749,Dad instead of mom here.
6750,It’s an absolute lovely dress and you make it look amazing.
6751,Don’t regret it.
6752,Wear it with pride and happiness.
6753,He is a guest in the home that is you.
6754,He does not get a say in the decor.
6755,It's so pretty.
6756,It's like a princess dress.
6757,Honestly it is a little big for prom.
6758,You will be dancing and in crowded areas.
6759,It is nothing like a wedding.
6760,The dress is beautiful and the feel good comments are great but for prom get something not as wide.
6761,How do you feel in it?
6762,That’s all that matters.
6763,Trust yourself.
6764,It is not a nowadays prom dress but it is beautiful
6765,"The dress is beautiful and I bet you are, too."
6766,Maybe it's the boyfriend that you should change.
6767,PS Go by yourself if you have to - and do so proudly and with your head held high.
6768,"Big sis here, tell your dude to shut it."
6769,You look beautiful!!!
6770,The dress is beautiful.
6771,He doesn't deserve you.
6772,This dress is giving me serious Bridgerton vibes!
6773,Seriously beautiful on you too.
6774,I’m glad you’re not doing what everyone is doing right now.
6775,This is a classic!
6776,You look beautiful so you don’t have to worry about that.
6777,"I would, however, recommend finding a more respectful boyfriend."
6778,It's gorgeous is your boyfriend blind???
6779,?
6780,Clearly ya boy don’t have taste.
6781,That dress looks fabulous
6782,it’s ugly just being honest.
6783,Seriously girl don't regret.
6784,"First of all it fits you perfectly, second it's beautiful, and third it seems to have a personality to it so honestly I love it."
6785,Your bf needs to make sure to look like a million bucks standing next to you if he has such an opinion about it
6786,"It is a gorgeous, and it fits you beautifully."
6787,The boyfriend perhaps should appreciate what he’s got or you should lose him.
6788,Looks lovely.
6789,Tell the haters to get bent.
6790,"Odds are, one day you won't feel a thing for this guy."
6791,But you will always look back on rocking this dress on prom night with fond memories.
6792,You look like Cinderella🥺if I were you I’d do my hair like hers!
6793,It’s stunning and it is very flattering on you.
6794,I think he was probably expecting something more generic “JC Penny” prom dress.
6795,"This is unique, flirty, and beautifully detailed."
6796,Wear it with pride!
6797,The dress is gorgeous
6798,"No, it’s lovely and he’s an idiot."
6799,Dad for a minute here: He is not good enough for you.
6800,A man should not lie a woman.
6801,"And, a man should keep his mouth shut if the woman he cares about likes the thing she chose to be beautiful in."
6802,This is one of the most beautiful dresses I’ve seen in ages.
6803,I love the color and the detail!
6804,"Not just the embroidery, but the way they’ve turned the sleeves?"
6805,That’s just amazing.
6806,It also looks beautiful on you.
6807,Your boyfriend is undoubtedly a clueless teenager that knows eff-all about dresses and just wants you in some generic “sexy dress”.
6808,Seeking advice and approval from others with which to derive your own self worth will always lead to disappointment.
6809,Your boyfriend isn't wrong for having an opinion.
6810,"He could have lied to you, would you have preferred that or the truth?"
6811,These people who are attacking your boyfriend need to be reminded of that.
6812,Dont alter your opinion simply because your boyfriend has less tact than he has taste.
6813,You are the one wearing the dress.
6814,You love it.
6815,And you are right to do so.
6816,Believe in yourself and your style.
6817,The boyfriend-- not so much.
6818,Fluffy baby cow is a great description for this dress.
6819,It completely covers up the persons curves and makes them look like a stuffed plush toy.
6820,The dress is beautiful.
6821,You loved the dress enough to purchase it.
6822,"Your boyfriend had a choice, to be rude or kind."
6823,He chose rude.
6824,"His opinion dosen't matter, only yours."
6825,Never give another person power over your feelings.
6826,High school boyfriends ain’t worth shit.
6827,"One day you’ll be glad you went with what YOU like, and you’ll regret listening to him."
6828,"I think it looks like a Disney princess gown, I LOVE it."
6829,💕
6830,Your boyfriend should clean the poop out of his eyes and see how beautiful your dress is <3 Will you get some pretty bracelet and earrings with it?
6831,I love it!
6832,"Not even a mom or a woman, wear what you feel beautiful in, plus that’s a nice dress."
6833,"Boyfriend can go kick rocks, that dress looks fantastic."
6834,Enjoy prom despite his mood.
6835,You look like Elsa from frozen
6836,"Well you've pretty much got the prom dress I wished I could have had except my school's prom was the latest one in town and the local mall was sold out of the very few long dresses they had because that was the year that FAHSHUN(TM) decided that short dresses were ""in"" so I ended up with what felt like an ""old lady dress"" from the women's formal section at Macy's that my sister unilaterally decided to buy for me without my consent."
6837,So yeah.
6838,You go girl.
6839,Do whatcha wanna.
6840,Don't let the boy's misguided opinion get you down.
6841,You look stunning.
6842,Ditch the boyfriend.
6843,"Lose the boy, keep the dress."
6844,The dress is trash.
6845,It’s personally not my taste but I’d respect that you like it and wouldn’t in a million years make you feel insecure about wearing it.
6846,If only there were dresses that pretty in my day.
6847,Prom is only what you make it.
6848,It's all about your ability to connect and live in the joy of the moment.
6849,If he's drawing you down then go and just be you in that dress being the gosh darn boss princess you are.
6850,The dress is beautiful
6851,Tell your BF to get a COVID test because he clearly has no taste.
6852,That dress is gorgeous.
6853,Well this sub is basically r/freecompliments
6854,Imo this looks more a wedding dress.
6855,Its nice looking dont get me wrong but its wedding for me.
6856,"Personally, I don’t like it at all."
6857,This dress is so beautiful.
6858,It's not the dress it's the color.
6859,Not a modern or fitting color for the design or occasion.
6860,"Keep the dress, drop the boyfriend."
6861,:)
6862,"I’m not a mom - not even sure why I am seeing this on my home page, but I absolutely love the dress."
6863,I would have as a high school guy too - it isn’t all about silk/satin smooth dresses.
6864,I think it has a lot of really good character and pop.
6865,You look like straight out of a fairy tale.
6866,"The dress is wonderful, your bf isn't."
6867,"Firstly, if you love it, then your boyfriend should never have been telling you he hates it."
6868,Even if he did.
6869,He isnt wearing it.
6870,"Secondly, its absolutely gorgeous!"
6871,And definitely something I would love to wear as well.
6872,You made a good choice!
6873,Your boyfriend can either suck it up or he'a gonna lose a good girl cuz you deserve better.
6874,Ehhh fuck your bf.
6875,Your bfs an asshole.
6876,That dress is beautiful.
6877,"If your boyfriend doesn’t like it, then perhaps he just shouldn’t wear it."
6878,Nah the dress definitely looks bad.
6879,Guys are allowed to have a fashion opinion.
6880,So I'm guessing most of these ultra positive responses are from single women who spend too much time on that Witches subreddit.
6881,"Coming from a man, is the dress fine?"
6882,Sure.
6883,Is it beautiful?
6884,Fuck no.
6885,It fits you fine I just think it's poor fashion.
6886,A little old school without much of the charm.
6887,Kinda weird how it's got so much going up too and then plain Jane on the bottom.
6888,But that's just 2 men's opinions.
6889,"And instead of immediately cutting off your boyfriend's head because I'm a lonely spinster, a person might ask if he did anything to deserve it."
6890,Not liking a dress does not make someone evil.
6891,If he was a dick or used cruel language then yeah fuck him.
6892,But I don't see any quotes or even descriptions here.
6893,It's just prom you won't give a shit in 3 years anyway but good luck and have fun!
6894,Honestly I’ll never understand being with someone who affects your self worth like that.
6895,Gorgeous dress and looks amazing on you :)
6896,"Dress looks fine, ditch the loser and trade him for more self-respect."
6897,Don't waste your time with someone who treats you that way.
6898,im not a mom but the dress is nice as fuck
6899,"Sweetie, your dress looks AMAZING."
6900,Where I come from we have a saying.
6901,"""Tough shit""."
6902,If someone doesn't like something then that's their problem.
6903,The dress is Beautyful your bf is a dick and ugly.
6904,"Looks good, you need a strapless bra though"
6905,No.
6906,It's fine.
6907,Also nobody cares :)
6908,I really like it
6909,It's beautiful.
6910,Dump the boyfriend and take yourself to the prom.
6911,"Not a mom, but a sister: I love it!"
6912,"It looks a lot like a dress I wanted to get for a ball (couldn’t bc they didn’t ship to my country, I’m still sad about that)

And eta: I don’t think you need a strapless bra!"
6913,"It comes down to personal taste, but with the brastraps being in a fitting color, imo it still looks great."
6914,"And I know from myself I always prefer to have bra straps with a strapless dress, somehow I feel more comfortable that way."
6915,I love it
6916,You’re dress is stunning!
6917,"Beautiful, timeless and elegant!"
6918,"Beautiful choice, my dear."
6919,It’s gorgeous.
6920,"I don’t think you could have chosen a more beautiful dress, OP."
6921,You look stunning.
6922,It’s beautiful and classy.
6923,The cut is sorta 50s chique.
6924,I love it.
6925,Your boyfriend shouldn’t roll his insecurities off on you.
6926,It looks really nice.
6927,What is wrong with their eyes?
6928,"I'm not a mom but I am a person with functional eyes who had recently enjoyed some videos of ""wish mishaps"" and expected something like that with this title... but that dress is lovely!"
6929,"So flattering, the color is very unique but still mild enough that you will stand out in only a positive way!"
6930,"I don't know what your hair would be done like but it fits well, goes with your skin tone very nicely, just an overall beautiful dress!"
6931,"Like, I gasped when I saw it because that's so far from bad!"
6932,You did a great job picking it!
6933,"Sis, it's gorgeous."
6934,"Leave the boy, keep the dress."
6935,I think the dress is lovely but I do feel it reads a bit more “wedding dress dyed blue” than a prom dress.
6936,It doesn’t have any of the contemporary features that modern prom dresses have.
6937,The lace is the part that I think really makes it come across as “overdone”
6938,"Classy, looks good."
6939,He’s an arsehole.
6940,The dress looks great.
6941,"However, it might need a little adjustment on the fit."
6942,It might look a bit better than great.
6943,"Nothing wrong with that, right?"
6944,:)
6945,Beautiful dress.
6946,I clicked expecting something borderline likeable but it is very nice.
6947,The color and classic look!
6948,Very pretty.
6949,You should tell your bf you don't like him
6950,"My dear, the dress is enchantingly beautiful."
6951,"Yes, it doesn't look simple or elegant."
6952,But it is your dress.
6953,"Your dress is about you, not about what other people wants to see."
6954,Wear it because you feel beautiful in it.
6955,"The choice of embroidery, colour and fabric spells magical."
6956,That means you are nothing but magical.
6957,Tell your boyfriend that's who you are.
6958,"And if he didn't want to acknowledge that, then find someone who will."
6959,Be your own Cinderella :)
6960,It’s gorgeous.
6961,Did you only start to doubt your choice after your bf told you he didn't like it.
6962,"Which,  BTW, is a crap thing to do."
6963,"I’ve read your comments and it seems like you’ve answered your own question, that it’s too formal for the occasion."
6964,"I think people are jumping on the bandwagon to cancel your bf, but the point is being missed that you need to be comfortable and it doesn’t sound like you would be wearing this dress."
6965,"Find something a bit shorter in a more youthful, fun style."
6966,You look amazing.
6967,Only thing I would consider losing would be the bf.
6968,"Oh, it’s so pretty and fits you well!"
6969,The color and cut are flattering.
6970,"I’m sorry he doesn’t like it because I know it undermines your positive feelings about the dress, but don’t let him steal your joy."
6971,Nobody has the right to impose their opinion on you.
6972,Simply tell him that it makes you so happy to wear the dress and you feel beautiful in it.
6973,"He is welcome to have an opinion, too, and when he shares his opinion you can thank him for telling you how he feels."
6974,I caution you against changing the dress on his say-so.
6975,"Doing so sets a negative, controlling precedent because really, why does he care so much about your dress?"
6976,Is he insecure when you have something you like?
6977,Does he just want to bring make you feel less confident?
6978,What’s his goal?
6979,"Now if you ask his opinion and he’s like, “Meh, I don’t really like it, but you do you,” then he’s just being honest about his preferences."
6980,I frankly don’t see how he’ll be able to have that opinion after seeing his girlfriend beaming with happiness while wearing this beautiful gown.
6981,So I’m gonna be a dick here but I don’t like it based on I don’t like leaf patterns or the texture they give out I also don’t like the way dresses look that have that lace like layer idk what it’s called now the color idc I’m not your date and I don’t have to match it with a tie anyway.
6982,But also I feel like prom is likely a wedding us guys don’t really care about the event wear and it’s mostly for the women we go so ya he a dick but also did he give reasons for not liking other than color
6983,It looks nice.
6984,That bf of yours needs a smack on the face with a 4 legged chair.
6985,it's a dress from a thousand and one nights
6986,It’s sooo beautiful!!!!
6987,And so are you !!
6988,!I’m so so sorry you’re boyfriend doesn’t see that

6997,Boyfriends being dumb cause this dress looks incredible!
6998,Not a mom but I'll happily be an older sibling that can tell you that that dress is gorgeous and you look great in it.
6999,"Dress is probably prettier than your boyfriend, maybe he's jealous lol"
7000,"I stumbled on this post from the front page and, with Oscar season here, thought I was seeing something made for Hollywood’s elites."
7001,"So, yeah, the problem isn’t anything I’m seeing in the 2 photos."
7002,Spending a lot of money on Prom?
7003,That's your first mistake.
7004,"Idk why I'm even here, I'm a dude."
7005,"But for all It's worth, i think your dress looks lovely"
7006,It’s gorgeous.
7007,Truly!
7008,Incredible color!
7009,"That’s an ugly dress, but if you like it who cares"

7012,Make it about yourself and wear what you love ❤️ Don’t change your mind just to be a better accessory to your boyfriend.

7015,Be the princess.
7016,"And also, if possible, consider finding someone who will see how much you love your dress and go along with what makes you happy."
7017,"If you ever wondered why guys lie or keep opinions to themselves, look no further than the mob mentality in this thread."
7018,"It is pretty and,princess-like."
7019,I get Cinderella vibes.
7020,He was probably hoping for something more on the sexy side of things.
7021,"Nice dress, not nice boyfriend."
7022,This is my dream dress if it were pink!
7023,"I think the issue is that it's ""princessy"" not ""sexy"" so it's appealing to the female gaze (aka, being visually appeasing doesn't have to make someone attracted to you) instead of the male gaze."
7024,"You're beautiful, don't change a thing ❤"
7025,I'm not a mom nor a parent but I'll be a big brother for a minute.
7026,The dress look amazing waIT WHAT I'LL FIGHT THAT ASSHOLE NOONE SAYS MEAN OF MY BABY SISTER >:(
7027,I hope that dress makes you feel as beautiful as you look!
7028,"Great color, great fit."
7029,The dress is the one...I'm not sure about the guy.
7030,"Hey sis, the dress is beautiful and fits you so well."
7031,"If ANYONE disagrees with you just tell them ""It's okay to be wrong""."
7032,"Being the weird goth mum, this isn't my style."
7033,"However, you look gorgeous in it."
7034,"The fit suits you, the colour is actually gorgeous (might find something in this colour myself!)"
7035,You look like a princess so go feel like one!
7036,Get a sparkly tiara and a pretty necklace to match!
7037,"Hell get a hidden dagger to sacrifice anyone to lucifer who says anything bad, I mean, some nice shoes!"
7038,"Rock your dress, be your beautiful self."
7039,"And honestly, bfs are overrated."
7040,There's time to grow and mature and you can always find a better bf.
7041,"Thought I was on r/relationship_advice for a second, what the fuck are these commenters on about."
7042,Looks okay
7043,"I am a middle age bloke with a missus, your dress is stunning."
7044,"If your BF dosnt like it that’s fine but you are both becoming adults, having different opinions is natural and he should support you as his partner."
7045,My miso and I have disagreements all the time and we respect each others opinions even if we don’t agree.
7046,Did you like the dress before the commented on it?
7047,Then it’s perfect.
7048,His opinion shouldn’t matter.
7049,Your dress is beautiful number one and two if he is trying to decide what you wear then he has the problem not you.
7050,There's literally 0 reason for you to feel bad about this purchase.
7051,The dress is fantastic.

7057,Not sure how else to say it.

7059,"Disclaimer: Not a regular to this subreddit, just passing through while browsing r/Popular."
7060,This is absolutely gorgeous and fits so well on you.
7061,You should ditch the boyfriend instead of the dress!
7062,You deserve someone who can see your beauty.
7063,"Dad here, it is a gorgeous dress and you look amazing in it."
7064,He doesn't like it probably cause it makes him feel like he needs to step up his game clothing wise and or is afraid to loose you to someone else.
7065,Dont let him start doubting yourself
7066,Nope its absolutely beautiful 😍
7067,"Sugar the only thing you chose wrong was your boyfriend, you look stunning and th shape fits you!"
7068,!
7069,Sorry not a mom here.
7070,Your boyfriend remind me of my teenage self.
7071,"Mostly ignorant about how life works, wrongly fighting beautiful traditions, tasteless, and blindly irrespectful for others’ feelings or opinions."
7072,If you don’t wear this dream of a dress to your prom you will regret it and he will regret it.
7073,"If you do, when 20 years down the road he looks at his prom photo he will appreciate the dress and laugh at how silly he was by even mentioning the possibility of you not wearing it."
7074,"There is a lot of assumptions in this comment, and also an undeserved focus on your BF perspective."
7075,Still wanted to share that.

7111,He doesn’t have to like it.
7112,"But he should respect your choices, understand the joy you have about your dress."
7113,You want those around you to lift you up not bring you down.
7114,Hugs.
7115,"Enjoy the night, be safe."
7116,Don’t drink and drive.
7117,"Oh, that is beautiful!"

7119,And it fits your skin tone so well!
7120,It fits YOU well!

Don’t give any more thought or attention to someone who is a judge that easily - for free!"

7144,You wear it for like 6 hours and never agian....again.... doesn't really matter.
7145,You look stunning.
7146,The color and style are perfect.
7147,"Your boyfriend must have the style sense of a spoon, because girl, this dress looks great on you."
7148,It's a nice dress but is overboard for prom imo.
7149,But I'm a dude that has worn the same clothes for 25 years
7150,The first thing I thought when I looked at your picture—before reading the title or subreddit!
7151,was w o w that’s a beautifulll dress
7152,"You have exquisite taste, the dress is gorgeous."
7153,The first thing I thought when I looked at your picture—before reading the title or subreddit!
7154,was w o w that’s a beautifulll dress

7156,Your boyfriend isn’t wearing it so he gets no say
7157,"Ditch the boyfriend, not the dress!"
7158,It’s gorgeous.
7159,I’d want that one of I’d ever had prom
7160,"Classic lines, great fit, wonderful color with your skin tone, and beautiful embroidery."
7161,Tell your BF to buy his own damned dress.
7162,"You, my dear, have excellent taste and have chosen a dress that can be worn again and again."
7163,You have gotten so much love for this dress already.
7164,I just have to tell you you look beautiful in this dress.
7165,"Maybe I'm too old, but that seems like a perfect prom dress."
7166,"Also not to be sexist, but I find boys are generally clueless about these things."
7167,It’s gorgeous!
7168,I’d rock it with sneakers or docs for that Lily Allen/Billie Eilish vibe
7169,Such a lovely dress.
7170,"You should ask him for a pic of what he'd prefer, obviously don't listen to him, but it would give you insight on him."
7171,For example was he expecting some slutty dress?
7172,"A lot of fellas are only thinking about sex at prom, whereas it's about so much more for the ladies, they'll never understand until they are much older and it's their daughters going to prom."
7173,That dress is absolutely gorgeous and you look stunning in it!

7180,It looks beautiful on you!
7181,Your boyfriend is an asshole
7182,Do you like it?
7183,I think it looks lovely.

7185,Maybe it's time for an upgrade.
7186,That dress is gorgeous.
7187,What experience does your bf have in fashion I’m guessing none.
7188,I’m sure he will be wearing a plain black tux.
7189,That dress makes you look like a princess and you need a prince to accompany.
7190,The color the flow and how it fits is perfect.
7191,Learn a lesson from this don’t let others opinions make you second guess your decisions.
7192,It looks amazing!
7193,"The dress is nice, your bf is not."
7194,If the shoes are really REALLY nice then...

7205,Is it returnable?
7206,No?
7207,It's lovely and he's an idiot.
7208,Is it returnable ?
7209,Yes?

7225,Keep the dress.
7226,It is beautiful and so are you.
7227,Add some accessories and lose the boyfriend.
7228,Weird dress
7229,I love that color.
7230,"If you like it, that's all that matters."
7231,Keep being you!
7232,I need the name of this dress because it's perfection and I want to wear it to a formal wedding I have coming up!!!!
7233,you look amazing sweetheart.
7234,don't let someone without taste or class make you feel less than perfect in this dress.
7235,"this dress perfectly accentuates your hourglass figure, the color is stunning on you, and the details are delightful."
7236,"Ditch the boyfriend, not the dress."
7237,"You’ll have more boyfriends in life than you will have proms, do what you want."
7238,It looks good.
7239,Ahh..
7240,It's only a prom dress and even though I personally like it I don't it's ugly idk why ur bf thinks that
7241,this is your bestie.
7242,it looks amazing on you.
7243,find a boyfriend who agrees🖤
7244,You look truly stunning.
7245,That neckline and waist are doing wonders for your figure too.
7246,Extremely flattering.
7247,"Also, this sort of dress often looks cheaply made, but yours looks like it's constructed really well."
7248,A simple updo for your hair and a thin necklace with just a small understated pendant will make the look feel more grown up / formal / elegant.
7249,"Good luck, sweet girl!"
7250,Im no mom.
7251,But its beautiful!
7252,Enjoy your day.
7253,"Ive seen so many prom dresses, and yours is way less cringe than most."
7254,"Keep the dress, replace the boy!"
7255,"Um I would wear this to my own wedding, find a new dude"
7256,Holy crap that dress is *divine* and you are rocking it!
7257,"I am serious right now, I wish that had been my prom dress 15 years ago."
7258,Not sure what's wrong with your boyfriend.
7259,If your boyfriend cares more about the dress looking a certain way than the person wearing it… drop him… he’s probably gay if he’s that worried about a dress.
7260,(And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that but it doesn’t do you any good to take abuse as a beard)
7261,it's stunning.
7262,he's probably worried someone might steal you away.
7263,wear it and feel as beautiful as you did the day you bought it!
7264,!
7265,"It just looks old fashioned and gaudy, not something you’d expect a high school girl to wear to prom"
7266,"Dress is beautiful, fuck them both"
7267,"sweetheart that dress is beautiful, the style looks amazing and the colour compliments your skin tone."
7268,"there is nothing about this dress that is wrong or ""ugly""."
7269,"also if you feel this is THE dress then who cares what any one thinks, you could go to your prom in a trash bag as long as it makes you feel beautiful."
7270,"i can tell you now you are going to look and feel like a princess when your prom roles around, and if your boyfriend is going to make you feel bad about the dress you chose then go to prom with your girlfriends not him."
7271,I think it’s classy.
7272,Put your hair up and wear statement earrings but a simple necklace…you’d look like a princess
7273,Dress looks to old fashioned.
7274,Color with the design it has makes it look like a dress that's been in the family for awhile
7275,You look very pretty in the dress.
7276,"The fit and the color are so flattering, and the dress is classic and timeless."
7277,I think you picked the right gown & you could totally wear it again!
7278,I hope you post some pics from prom night for us to gush over.
7279,I love it!
7280,Your going to look amazing.
7281,Ditch the boy for a better look ;)
7282,Im just some random 16 year old but I think you look absolutely lovely.
7283,Also I've got no clue why reddit is showing me this random post
7284,No idea why this is in my recommended but the dress looks great.
7285,Don't worry.
7286,It's soooooo beautiful
7287,It's gorgeous and stunning.
7288,I'm so sorry he's made you feel bad about a dress you love.
7289,He wouldn't have done that if he truly cared about you.
7290,"You love lovely and if the dress makes you feel like a beautiful princess/queen, then that's all that matters."
7291,"Nah, get rid of the boyfriend!"
7292,The dress is beautiful!
7293,& you’re going to look gorgeous on prom night with a man that appreciates you!
7294,It’s seriously just amazing.
7295,I think it’s prom-perfect!
7296,It is not too much at all!
7297,"It’s prom, you should go all out anyway!"
7298,You’ll remember the dress more than the boyfriend in the future anyway haha!
7299,That’s stunning oh my gosh.
7300,I would wear that in a heartbeat
7301,"If you were my daughter I’d tell you, in complete honesty, that your dress is probably the prettiest I’ve ever seen, that you look completely beautiful in it, that your boyfriend needs to wind his bloody neck in and that if I were you I’d actually be reconsidering the relationship with someone who crushes your self confidence like this."
7302,I promise you that there’s probably not another dress-wearing person here who thinks that your dress is a mistake.
7303,It’s absolutely gorgeous.
7304,"Your boyfriend, however, is being a jerk."
7305,"TL:DR version - Keep the dress, dump the guy."
7306,And have a wonderful time at the prom with your beautiful and confident self❤️
7307,Looks like an off color wedding dress or a brides made dress for a very formal wedding.
7308,But if it makes you happy go for it
7309,"Random guy on internet: it looks great, go have fun."
7310,You only go to prom once.
7311,Go with your friends instead.
7312,Dress is cool.
7313,Boyfriend is not.
7314,It has class.
7315,Be yourself.
7316,He won’t be your bf for long.
7317,Hey I'm a dude just discovering this subreddit for the first time ever and while it probably means little...the dress looks just fine.
7318,You're overthinking and your boyfriend is kinda being a dick.
7319,Life what it is worth I like it.
7320,"Dad here, but your boyfriend is a moron."
7321,You look amazing.
7322,"Good grief, the horrendous comments just to make you feel better."
7323,I saw the dress before I read the title.
7324,"My first reaction was ""That's an ugly dress."""
7325,My post reply: it's called an opinion.
7326,"You can disagree with it, as I don't hide them behind tact just to make you feel better."
7327,"You're old enough to handle this, right?"
7328,"The dress itself is very nice, but the ornamental design of ... weeds?"
7329,... with the outline of ...
7330,"""pearls""?..."
7331,destroys the natural flow of the dress.
7332,The color is very suitable for a prom as well.
7333,"Find an identical dress without the garbage over it, and wear it in front of a mirror."
7334,Guarantee you'll see a much better dress than this disgusting excuse of attire.
7335,That dress is great.
7336,Nothing else to be said
7337,"Not a mum, not even female."
7338,That dress is very nice and suits you!
7339,"Get yourself a man who loves you when you're wearing a potato sack, the dress isnt the problem here"
7340,Maybe that's why on wedding days they don't let men see the dress before so he can't make some stupid selfish negative comment and then forget he even said the thing that shattered your world.
7341,Men are stupid.
7342,Keep the dress and find a different man.
7343,Don't waste your time on the jerks.
7344,"That's a gorgeous, classic dress in a wonderful color."
7345,You look terrific.
7346,"It looks pretty, uhhh, old school?"
7347,"Not in a great way, to be honest."
7348,Because it's hard to take it off 😉 or makes him feels like marriage
7349,"It's a great fit, I love the color, the design is beautiful, and the neckline is gorgeous!"
7350,You deserve a million times better than that jerk
7351,I love it!
7352,"Im not a mom, but just a normal human being.. keep the dress."
7353,"Shop for a new boyfriend (it's both the right thing to do, and WAYY cheaper)"
7354,It’s lovely.
7355,Wear it with confidence
7356,Mumsey
7357,I LOVE it!!!!
7358,!
7359,I hate dresses.
7360,I love yours.
7361,You look lovely.
7362,"Dad here;

Honey, do you feel comfortable in it?"
7363,How do you think you look in it?
7364,"Last time I checked, your date isn’t wearing the dress, and he doesn’t have to be your date if he’s gonna be shitty."
7365,"Nutjob commenters holy moley, the bf has a right to an opinion on how his gf dresses."
7366,"Haven't seen a comment praising his honesty either, the women here seem to only like guys who mindlessly like everything they wear or do."
7367,"Anyway if he doesn't like it and you're not really fussed, maybe get another."
7368,If you really like it then go ahead and wear it anyway.
7369,Simple.
7370,"Just take his opinion into consideration, but it's still your choice in the end."
7371,Not a fan.
7372,Sorry for not following the circle jerk
7373,"It feels you so well but doesn’t look prom, looks like a bad bridesmaid dress."
7374,Keep the dress.
7375,Return the boyfriend.
7376,I think you should replace the boyfriend.
7377,The dress is beautiful!
7378,Stunning!!
7379,!
7380,Im sorry bit that's a nice dress.
7381,And it seems to fit you good.
7382,Maybe the boyfriend's tux inhibited the bloodflow to his brain?
7383,Dad here btw 😊
7384,"This has a ton of responses so I hope you'll see this... On the day, please take as many pics as you can of JUST yourself."
7385,"Or if you're a senior, take some of your senior photos wearing it."
7386,"You may grow out of the dress AND the boy, and you'll want to have photos of just you that doesn't also include memories of him if it's a bad breakup."
7387,"It's a beautiful dress and it looks incredible on you, and you deserve to remember how you looked and felt like a princess for prom years and years from now."
7388,It's a perfect dress and the only one who needs to love it is you.
7389,"If your boyfriend is being like that, you may also need to address some heavy stuff - partners that try to control or belittle how their partners dress or look is often an initial red flag that can lead to more things."
7390,"We all love you and your beautiful dress, honey."
7391,Very pretty
7392,The dress looks great!
7393,Since when do boys know about fashion anyway?
7394,"And all that aside, going to prom isn't about how anyone looks or dresses."
7395,It's about having a fun night and making memories with your friends.
7396,And maybe getting shithoused on cheap beer at the after party.
7397,"Don't worry about the dress, focus on the experience"
7398,Yes.
7399,It’s hideous
7400,I LOVE it.
7401,Gorgeous
7402,"Great, my other daughter saw that picture of yours and now I need to make her a dress „so that she also looks beautiful like cinderella in that picture“ :) 

It fits you beautifully, looks well crafted, is not too much and really perfect for a prom!"
7403,Get your boyfriend a matching tie or something and you both will look amazing!!
7404,(On a side note: I now want that dress too :D)
7405,I think it's lovely.
7406,Oh honey I had a boyfriend like that long long ago.
7407,I kicked him to the curb.
7408,All he did was slowly chip away at my self confidence.
7409,Just a little at a time to where you didn’t really notice.
7410,But it adds up.
7411,"A real man boy lifts you up, not tear you down."
7412,Keep the dress and get rid of the boyfriend.
7413,The dress is absolutely gorgeous.
7414,Love to know where you got it.
7415,My teenage daughters LOVE it.
7416,I showed it to them and asked(they’re 15&17) their opinion as well.
7417,The detail on it is beautiful.
7418,You are beautiful in this dress.
7419,Enjoy the prom!
7420,But maybe with another guy…
7421,Sick dress bro.
7422,You're killing it.
7423,It's beautiful!
7424,Don't ever let a boy/man tell you how to dress.
7425,"It's your body, your life, your decision."
7426,You don't exist to just look the way he wants you to look.
7427,Do you like it??
7428,That’s all that matters.
7429,"It's really, really beautiful."
7430,"Please do better than my generation did, refuse to waste your prom by spending it with a rude, tasteless jerk."
7431,"Whatever good points he has, he is NOT WORTH IT"
7432,i absolutely adore it!
7433,"i tend to be pretty judgy on dresses i’ll be honest, but i would totally wear yours!"
7434,It's really not his place to critique what you wear.
7435,You look lovely and that dress is very pretty imo.
7436,I like it.
7437,Your boyfriend's a dick.
7438,You can do better.
7439,Stop caring what people think.
7440,"Especially, family and friends."
7441,"If you like the dress, if it’s fun, and comfortable, that’s all that matters."
7442,"Live your life and be who you desire to be, not who everyone else thinks you should be."
7443,"I know I’m not a mom, but be happy, and once you are, don’t let anyone take it away from you."
7444,Get a new boyfriend.
7445,it's a really beautiful dress.
7446,"Life is too short to have people like that in your life, if you love it then that's all that matters."
7447,You dont need no man and you don't need internet stranger to know you look DAMN FINE IN THAT DRESS!
7448,You only get to do this a few times in life so rock your dress and have a damn good time doing it.
7449,If he doesn't like it he needs to wash out his eyes
7450,The color is lame.
7451,Kind of pale.
7452,"Couturiere and mother of teenagers here —

The dress suits you so well — beautiful shape, fit, color."
7453,It sets off your figure and your skin tone beautifully.
7454,Absolutely classic.
7455,I absolutely love it!
7456,He should be grateful to have such a date to the prom.
7457,I love it and it looks great on you.
7458,Nice pick!
7459,"Who ""hates"" a dress?"
7460,Your boyfriend should grow the fuck up
7461,I really do not like your boyfriend…
7462,"depending on your personality, you might be able to make this look your own."
7463,i don't see it being a hit though.
7464,"there's something not-so-subtly gaze-averting about it, probably the 70's russian wallpaper floral combined with the color that looks like was from an age when dye manufacturing wasn't quite there yet."
7465,the overall effect is that it looks like it was picked up secondhand.
7466,"but like i said, maybe that's the goal look."
7467,You’re beautiful
7468,23 year old guy here.
7469,"Green is a cool color, flowers are fire."
7470,Straight 10/10 dress.
7471,Find you a 10/10 man to match because he sounds like your problem.
7472,Orrrrr go with friends and enjoy your evening in a dress you like.
7473,"Also take shoes for after, you'll thank me."
7474,"Sister here, love it!"
7475,You did great picking out a dress babe
7476,Would’ve choose a different color.
7477,Sounds like you need a new boyfriend who isn’t a jerk
7478,Looks great.
7479,Most guy’s would be thrilled taking you to prom in that.
7480,STUNNING how dare you wear anything else but that queen !!
7481,!
7482,Tell your boyfriend to piss off for making you second guess... That dress is beautiful
7483,", Don’t let your boyfriend’s insecurities get in the way of you loving what you love."
7484,"Honey, those sleeves are EVERYTHING."
7485,I think you chose a beautiful dress!
7486,"Remember what we do when boys try to doubt us- we don’t ask ourselves if the boy is right, we ask ourselves if it makes us happy or not :) 

If this dress makes you happy, then you wear the hell out of it."
7487,It looks beautiful on you!
7488,!
7489,It’s beautiful!
7490,Beautiful
7491,Time for a new boyfriend

7509,Return your boyfriend keep the dress.
7510,"Absolutely gorgeous love 💙😍 that color looks perfect on you, and the style is very classic."
7511,"I hope you have a wonderful prom with wonderful memories, and enjoy wearing the dress for future events too!"
7512,I'm kinda shocked people are saying it's like a fairy princess.
7513,It's much more like a fairy godmother to me.
7514,"If you like it, that's what matters, but I do consider it to be quite matronly/mature and not what I'd expect a teen to wear."
7515,I like it.
7516,Beautiful beading.
7517,I like it!
7518,Is your boyfriend typically contrarian?
7519,"It could be a bad day or a bad take, but is kind of a red flag to try and impose control over your appearance"
7520,"Holy shit I love it so much, is he blind?!"
7521,?
7522,That is a *gorgeous* dress!
7523,Your “boyfriend” has terrible taste if he doesn’t like it!
7524,Who is he to criticize your fashion sense on one of the most important days of your life?!
7525,Do you still want to go to prom with this guy?
7526,Because I say you ditch him and go with more supportive friends so you can feel confident and rock your gown!
7527,He can go dance by himself!
7528,"Love, 
Your older sister"
7529,Any boyfriend who doesn’t make you feel like a goddam princess needs to go!
7530,Btw the dress is beautiful.
7531,You could tell him if he doesn’t like it he can buy you another one
7532,If your highschool boyfriend has the gall to say your dress isn't anything but wonderful or beautiful...he sounds like he should be your ex-boyfriend.
7533,Guys who act like that in highschool only get worse.
7534,Your dress looks fantastic.
7535,That dress is gorg!
7536,"Women dress up for themselves first, other women second, and guys last."
7537,Don't let him talk you out of your opinion.
7538,Enjoy the dance!
7539,"Your boyfriend wants you to wear one of those ridiculous ""prom"" dresses that basically look like underwear, I bet."
7540,Your boyfriend is a tasteless asshat.
7541,Please send him over to do some gardening.
7542,Tell him to bring a shovel.
7543,It's beautiful.
7544,The colour is stunning on you!
7545,!
7546,You look so beautiful in this dress!
7547,you’re stunning.
7548,Im biased As a dad who just bought his daughter a very similar $1000 dress for her event.
7549,"After months of searching, it put a smile on her face and we melted taht she was happy."
7550,my wallet though….
7551,If you feel good in it ... that's all that matters !!
7552,What we wear is the expression of who we are ... no one can tell you who you are but you
7553,"Dude, cool dress"
7554,"Oh honey, this dress is GORGEOUS!!"
7555,You look like a modern princess.
7556,"He's completely wrong, and I'm so sorry he's making you feel bad."
7557,Lots of mental hugs being sent your way.
7558,You’ll wear it for 3-4 hours then never look at it again.
7559,You have to look at your husband forever.
7560,Personally I don’t like it that much.
7561,I don’t really hate it though.
7562,I think he was probably expecting something more to current trends and the contrast doesn’t help.
7563,"Has he seen it once, in person?"
7564,over facetime?
7565,a photo or two?
7566,I’m not sure why there are so many comments asking you to dump someone who doesn’t like something you’ve done.
7567,That’s going to be an obstacle you’ll have to handle in almost any relationship.
7568,"Overall though, it sounds like he didn’t play too much of a part in choosing the dress, so why are you placing such an importance on what he thinks?"
7569,"Lmao, everyone telling OP to break up because her bf doesn't like a dress."
7570,Classic reddit.
7571,"Have a talk about it and work it out, god damn."
7572,Not every minor argument needs to end a relationship.
7573,"I’ll be your dad for a minute: You look beautiful in that dress, hon."
7574,Hopefully dads are allowed here too.
7575,You look absolutely stunning and that dress is exquisite.
7576,Your boyfriend just has horrible taste.
7577,Hopefully your taste in partners grows to match your fashion instead of the other way around.
7578,Hope you have a blast either way.
7579,If he hates it then he doesn't have to wear it
7580,That's such a gorgeous dress and it fits you so well the color is also really nice.
7581,I'm guessing the BF was waiting something a little more skin tight and scandalous but this is classy and elegant!
7582,I really like it and I don't like prom dresses at all so that's saying a lot
7583,Keep the dress.
7584,Dump the boyfriend.
7585,Dance & laugh all night knowing you’re the smartest girl in the room.
7586,Go on to have an amazing life.
7587,💖
7588,Sweetheart your dress is stunning.
7589,"But even more than that, you are stunning."
7590,"Don’t ever let anyone, a man, a friend, anyone, dull your shine or lead you to doubt yourself."
7591,"On the night you will look beautiful in a beautiful dress, not least of all because you’ll also be wearing a beautiful smile 😊 if you are comfortable with it, make sure to post a picture of your evening, we will all be proud mum-for-a-minutes watching you go off to the prom."
7592,Hi princess!
7593,You are going to look beautiful for those prom photos.
7594,I can't agree with anyone who says otherwise.
7595,This is a really great pick.
7596,"Speaking as a man old enough to be your dad, ""You look beautiful sweetheart, (name of boyfriend) is lucky to be dating someone as beautiful and as intelligent as you are."""
7597,"""What's that?"""
7598,"""He doesn't like the dress?!?!?"""
7599,"""Is all of his taste in his mouth?"""
7600,"""Your mother and I think it's beautiful and we wouldn't change a thing."""
7601,"Boys are temporary, memories are forever."
7602,Throw away the obviously idiot boy.
7603,You look lovely and will have more fun and make better memories dancing the night away with your friends.
7604,"I'm just some mid-30s single dude with no kids who randomed across this, so not really ""mom"", but I went to three proms with two different young women in my day, so here's my two cents:

Most prom dresses I see look overly frilly, fragile, and uncomfortable."
7605,I hated the dresses my dates wore when I was in high school.
7606,"I was afraid to touch them, because it looked like they would rip in a stiff breeze."
7607,"And they all hated those dresses by the end of the night, because they were uncomfortable and awkward."
7608,"Your dress looks functional, while still being beautiful, and it looks comfortable."
7609,"It looks like the sort of dress you can dance in, and enjoy a party, without wishing you could burn the damn thing by the end of the night."
7610,"So, I think you picked wisely."
7611,Have a great time at prom!
7612,Don't take it too seriously; it's just a faux-fancy party.
7613,Have fun!
7614,*I* like it.
7615,Well what the fuck is he wearing then?
7616,If he's not dressed like a goddamn Kingsmen then he has no right to speak.
7617,"It is a beautiful dress, just not in the style of a modern  prom dress."
7618,This dress is gorgeous and 100% prom appropriate.
7619,You look amazing in it.
7620,"Don't change your dress, change your shallow boyfriend, he doesn't deserve you and you don't deserve to be treated like that."
7621,"If he is already pulling crap like this, it's just going to get much worse over the years."
7622,"Don't waste your precious time on him, he's not worth it."
7623,Use commas please
7624,"Honey, that dress is beautiful and beautiful *on you!"
7625,"*

Tell your boyfriend to get over himself and have your girlfriends hype you up."
7626,You bought it.
7627,You’re wearing it.
7628,Rock it and enjoy prom!!
7629,!
7630,"Its elegant, lovely but if boy friend hates it bring back or keep it if you love it."
7631,If you regret now bring back.
7632,Did u pull the tags off.
7633,?
7634,"I’m not mom, but I think the dress is cute."
7635,"As long as you like it, that’s all that should matter."
7636,"It was your money, and if you were feeling good about it before his input, continue to feel good about it because it was something YOU wanted."
7637,"Baby girl, you look like a fricking Disney Princess!!"
7638,But I would definitely consider finding a new date.
7639,😬
7640,Looks hella nice
7641,That's a beautiful dress!
7642,"Looks like it fits you nicely, also."
7643,"Looks amazing, your boyfriend might be a moron"
7644,I think it’s stunning
7645,I think it’s a beautiful dress.
7646,I’m taken but I’ll gladly take you to your prom if you’d like.
7647,Sure the wife would be all for it.
7648,"You paid for it, you like it, plus I happen to have been watching a lot of project runway and that’s a perfectly nice dress."
7649,Photo makes you look pretty too.
7650,What did your boyfriend want?
7651,A little black dress?
7652,Something slutty?
7653,"I can get that, but I wouldn’t verbalize it in this situation, dick."
7654,I love it!!
7655,the design/cut/embroidery is super elegant and looks great with your skin tone.
7656,I think it’ll look even better with a strapless bra.
7657,Have a great time at prom!
7658,!
7659,I think it’s really cute
7660,You look like a princess sis.
7661,Don't listen to him.
7662,Your prom dress and what you chose is a reflection of you!
7663,It’s intentional and beautiful and you should 100% wear it.
7664,Make your bf get over the top tux to match you
7665,"I'm a Dad, just I guess I'm old, but I think it looks elegant and beautiful, and if you wear it with confidence you will look and feel amazing."
7666,"I'm sorry other people put your choices down, but you liked this dress, it's prom and it happens once in your life, you bought this dress for a reason, because you saw yourself in pictures looking a certain way in it."
7667,"Stick to your heart girl, I only got boys but if I had a daughter that's what I'd say."
7668,You look like a fcking disney princess.
7669,I'm serious
7670,"Dad here:

You're gonna meet a lot of boys who are going to try to make you think they're right."
7671,This might even be your first one.
7672,"This isn't about your boy, it's about you."
7673,Prom represents the leap you'll be taking into the (relatively) great unknown.
7674,It’s beautiful.
7675,Tell him to keep his mouth closed.
7676,It's ugly af.
7677,No
7678,"I he doesnt like it, tell him to not wear it."
7679,Yeah I’d regret that purchase as well
7680,That’s a beautiful dress and you look stunning.
7681,"Lose the entire boyfriend, he shouldn’t be telling you what to wear."
7682,It’s fine if he has an opinion but he doesn’t need to share it.
7683,"My own *husband* never once thought he had the right to tell me his opinions on my *wedding dress* unless I asked, and even if he had hated it, he loved me more than a dress."
7684,Get yourself someone with better priorities
7685,That is a great prom dress!!!
7686,Could he possibly be feeling anxiety about his own wardrobe options or expectations for the evening.
7687,It's not great to be putting you down for stuff like this.
7688,Maybe he just doesn't have the tools to express himself without hurting other peoples feelings.
7689,You could mention it to him that you love your dress and would appreciate him sharing in your excitement for prom.
7690,I dont like it but I'd never tell my girlfriend that.
7691,That’s cute as shit!
7692,The dress is beautiful and fits her very well.
7693,But the color is not the most flattering for her.
7694,It’s beautiful!!!
7695,"Throw the whole boyfriend away, sis."
7696,It’s prom you’re over it
7697,It’s so darling!
7698,You look like a princess.
7699,Ignore the boy.
7700,It’s a gorgeous dress and it doesn’t look cheap like most prom dresses do.
7701,Absolutely nothing wrong with it.
7702,You look marvelous
7703,I think it's adorable
7704,Its beautiful
7705,It’s a wonderful dress.
7706,Looks fantastic on you.
7707,Not a mom.. in fact I’m a grown ass man.
7708,Keep the dress.. return the boyfriend.
7709,Honey.. Men dress to match their ladies.
7710,Boys tell them to wear something else.
7711,Yuck
7712,You’ll forget the boyfriend but will remember the dress.
7713,You look stunning!!
7714,!
7715,"You're already drowning in messages, but from one sister to another, as long as YOU feel good in the dress, that's all that matters."
7716,"I picked my formal dress because it reminded me of Hermione's Yule Ball gown, and I was so much more comfortable than I would've been in anything more ""trendy"", because that's just my style."
7717,You look stunning.
7718,"It's such a classic fit, very flattering to your figure, and it gives off *all* the princess vibes."
7719,"And my mum says it's ""absolutely beautiful"" on you, so it's doubly true."
7720,(Dad says your boyfriend must just be jealous because he wants to wear it instead!)
7721,It is beautiful on you.
7722,Rock it.
7723,Did you like it before your boyfriend opened his yap?
7724,Do you feel comfortable in it?
7725,Wear it!
7726,I had to reread the title .
7727,That dress is actually very nice .
7728,I'd kill to wear a dress like that and I'm in my late 30s.
7729,Don't let your bf decide for you.
7730,With hair and make up done just right you'll glow in that dress.
7731,What's not to like about it?
7732,The embroidery is beautiful and the flare is lovely.
7733,Congratulations on graduating soon.
7734,You go girl.
7735,"If it bothers you that he doesn’t love it, could you still take it back?"
7736,I think it’s GORGEOUS.
7737,Stunning Dress !
7738,!
7739,"Not a mom, I think most dresses look kinda stupid."
7740,This is a really good design
7741,It's not a very nice dress tbh
7742,It is stunning!
7743,You wear it beautifully.
7744,Tell your boyfriend to go pound sand.
7745,🤮
7746,You can wear whatever you want.
7747,The most important thing is whether you like the dress.
7748,"If you can't wear it to prom, where else can you wear it?"
7749,"Im a dude, but I think it's a nice dress."
7750,"I think you look nice in it as well, so i'm not sure what your bf is on about."
7751,"He is entitled to his opinion, but I think it's cool."
7752,I'm also not sure what all of these extreme comments are about dumping him over his opinion either.
7753,"In reality, you're not going to like everyones opinion and that's a fact of life."
7754,"Then again, I nearly forgot that this is reddit."
7755,"Where if your SO looks at you the wrong way, that's an automatic 15 red flags and a ""girl, you bettah leave that boy, yesterday!"""
7756,lmao.
7757,It’s a beautiful dress!!
7758,A few years ago I wore a very similar dress in bright red and had the time of my life feeling like a princess!
7759,These comments are fucking nuts
7760,Honestly?
7761,"When I read the title I thought it might be just a slightly off sized dress issue, but it looks fantastic."
7762,I wonder if it just doesn't suit his tastes or he's an idiot.
7763,Have a swell time at prom!
7764,"It’s not a modern look per se, but you look fine."
7765,Teenage boys have worse judgement than Wile E. Coyote.
7766,Ignore him.
7767,"If fact, whatever he wants to do, in general, is probably a bad idea on some level."
7768,This is exactly what I have in mind when I think “prom dress”.
7769,"It’s beautiful, you should definitely wear it if you are comfortable."
7770,I don’t think your bf understands what proms are like.
7771,The men don’t really have many options unless they want to go super bold (one guy turned up in a Hawaiian suit and a retired army vehicle at my prom).
7772,"But the women generally wear sparkly dresses similar to this in all sorts of colours, some girls wear suits too but they are usually more unique/stylish than the guy’s suits."
7773,"Honestly, I wish my prom dress had looked this beautiful!"
7774,You looks great!
7775,I LOVE this dress.
7776,I would get married in it.
7777,Drop the boyfriend and go to prom with your girlfriends!
7778,Best decision I made
7779,i love it!
7780,this is the kind of style i want from my wedding dress someday
7781,Your boyfriend is fucking idiot.
7782,Dump him and go alone you'll be a lot better off!
7783,I swear every redditor always advices people to break up with their significant other 😂😂😂😂😂😂
7784,Dump your boyfriend.
7785,Your boyfriend is a dipshit with no taste.
7786,Not sorry.
7787,"just some rando who was browsing the popular feed and came upon your post

I think that dress is fantastic, its for sure original."
7788,"If you like it, you should **defiantly** wear it even if your BF does not like it."
7789,"Hell I remember the guys at my high school didn't really like any prom dresses and although that was some time ago, I can't imagine much has changed since then."
7790,"Oh sweetie, that's lovely."
7791,It's classy & I LOVE the color.
7792,Tell your boyfriend to hush or you'll go with a bunch of friends instead of him.
7793,"I’m a 37 year old dude and Tbh I always hate prom dresses, but I think it looks great!"
7794,Keep the dress and ditch the boyfriend.
7795,He’s not good enough for you if he doesn’t support your decisions.
7796,The dress is gorgeous!
7797,I wish my prom dress had been half as good as this one.
7798,Simply lovely!
7799,Forget what he thinks lol.
7800,Have a wonderful time!
7801,I would get another boyfriend before I'd get rid of that dress.
7802,It's lovely.
7803,Cheaper to get a new date
7804,"Honey, the dress is beautiful."
7805,You look like an 18th century aristocrat and I love it!
7806,All you need now is your hair up in a bouffant!
7807,You don't get to wear dresses like that often and you clearly picked it because you liked it so don't let him convince you otherwise!
7808,I adore your dress.
7809,Could I borrow after you dazzle at prom?
7810,This is giving me serious sleeping beauty vibes.
7811,I absolutely love the dress.
7812,It sits perfectly on your figure as well.
7813,"If your boyfriend doesn’t like it, that’s his problem not yours."
7814,"If you honestly feel like he’s ruined the vibe and you don’t want to wear it, I would suggest telling him that if he wants you to wear a different one then he can pay for a new one."
7815,But it’s your body.
7816,Your dress.
7817,Your choice.
7818,Not his.
7819,You’re beautiful.
7820,"I’m late to the party, but you look great and I’m sure tons of guys would be lucky to take you to the prom."
7821,Your boyfriend doesn’t deserve you.
7822,Make sure to take A LOT of SOLO pictures.
7823,That dress looks great.
7824,Years from now on you will look that those photos and think i was stunner!
7825,That is a beautiful dress.
7826,I think you should keep the dress and get a new boyfriend.
7827,Looks good to me :)
7828,Only thing I have to ask is do you like it?
7829,Whaaat?
7830,That is a beautiful dress and you look amazing!
7831,"Jesus wept, that guy is an idiot!"
7832,Its beautiful!
7833,It’s Gorgeous!!
7834,"Love the color, the detailing, and most of all, the fit!"
7835,"🎶*let it go, let it go*🎶"
7836,It's beautiful - get a new boyfriend!
7837,You shouldn’t make him wear it if he hates it.
7838,It’s beautiful.
7839,Your boyfriend doesn’t get a say.
7840,"If he can’t apologize and make up for it somehow, go solo."
7841,He’s not worth it.
7842,You picked a dress that made you feel beautiful.
7843,"That has nothing to do with him, and he should’ve kept his mouth shut."
7844,"Honey, you look like a princess."
7845,"You’d look beautiful in any dress, but this one looks like it was made for you."
7846,"If he’s not going to be nice to you, he doesn’t deserve to go to prom with someone like you."
7847,I don't know much about fashion but I think your dress is lovely.
7848,"If you like it, ignore your boyfriend and wear it."
7849,He's an ass
7850,"Im a 26 year old guy and not a mom, but that dress looks awesome"
7851,You look beautiful sweetie
7852,Keep the dress.
7853,Lose the boyfriend.
7854,I love it so much it is elegant but i would love to twirl around in it
7855,What a beautiful dress!
7856,"You look like a million bucks, and it is an appropriate dress to wear to prom."
7857,It's beautiful and you look stunning.
7858,Does it make you feel like a princess?
7859,Does it make your heart sing with joy and happiness?
7860,Does it make you feel even more beautiful?
7861,Does it make you happy?
7862,Yes to any or all of them questions means it's the dress.
7863,Have an amazing night at prom
7864,I hate your boyfriend for saying that.
7865,That one declaration says so much about him.
7866,It’s beautiful.
7867,I really like it.
7868,Not sure about the boy friend though.
7869,My husband would have just said you look beautiful even if he didn't care for the dress because I spent a lot of money and liked it myself and felt good in it.
7870,I want that for you as well.
7871,Omg it’s beautiful!
7872,You look incredible!
7873,Your boyfriend must be a ding dong
7874,No way!
7875,Its absolutely beautiful on you!❤
7876,It fits beautifully.
7877,He's wrong.
7878,Wish something like that was available when I went to prom.
7879,Looks pretty good.
7880,I’d add a padded bra or something to balance the top out a bit with the bottom.
7881,Lose the wristband.
7882,But nothing wrong with it like it is.
7883,"Is  not ugly enough to not wear it, but is not pretty."
7884,Just saw this post passing by - dress is lovely.
7885,BF is incorrect.
7886,BF should not make negative comments.
7887,Wear good undergarments.
7888,Earrings and necklace set ( don't go huge on the necklace).
7889,Slippers or heels you can actually stand.
7890,Hair up or down.
7891,Go with your face for that.
7892,Don't go for pointy nails (snag).
7893,Have a great night.
7894,Don't let BF pee in your wheaties.
7895,"That's such a beautiful dress, can't wait to see a follow up post about how prom was!"
7896,That dress is baller and the pattern is cool as fuck.
7897,If ya BF don’t like it.
7898,Find a new BF.
7899,It’s beautiful!
7900,The color and the detailing…just beautiful.
7901,"if your boyfriend says anything about your dress other than it looks nice, he’s gay"
7902,Your dress is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!
7903,Frick off douche boyfriend😡
7904,I vaguely remember my boyfriend not liking my jr prom dress.
7905,It was babydoll pink and had a ton of tulle and roses.
7906,What I remember most about that prom was how the dress felt and twirled.
7907,It was like being a combination ballerina and princess.
7908,Boys can be socially stupid in high school and generally have no filter.
7909,"I’m not going to say ditch the boy (I married my jr prom date) but make sure this was a stupid slip of the tongue and that he wants you to be happy, not control you."
7910,It’s beautiful!!!!!
7911,!
7912,Baby blue isn’t the best color choice but design is great
7913,do you like it?
7914,I love it very cinderella.
7915,"boyfriend may or may not be in the picture later, so do you lovely."
7916,Also what are your thoughts on elbow length white gloves?
7917,"Sweetie, first of all, you should know that dress fits you like a glove and makes your body look stunning."
7918,"Second, I do agree with all the other moms that a good guy won’t make you feel ugly or make you question simple choices, like what you wear."
7919,"Abusive men tend to do this, not saying your boyfriend is like that, but it’s something to be aware of, cautious of and keep in the back of your mind as you move ahead in your relationship."
7920,"If he makes you feel bad or is controlling of little choices you make often, maybe reconsider this guy."
7921,"Third, the only thing that matters is how you feel."
7922,You need to have a good prom.
7923,Regardless of what he thinks.
7924,You need to do what will make you happy.
7925,"If you can take some time alone, in front of a mirror, look at yourself."
7926,Try to push away all the thoughts and feelings put in you by others.
7927,Try to look at yourself from YOUR point of view.
7928,Do you think you look beautiful in that dress?
7929,(I do) does it make you feel good?
7930,Will it make you stand out in a good way?
7931,Will you match the level of class everyone else will be wearing too?
7932,Like is everyone wearing a fancy dress or is it more of a casual dress prom?
7933,Ask yourself all the questions and be honest with yourself about how it feels to wear that dress.
7934,"If your doubts only come from the things others have said to you but you, yourself, have very little doubt and like how you look and feel comfortable, that’s your answer."
7935,"But no matter what, check in with yourself first."
7936,This is YOUR life.
7937,You need to make it the best it can be because this is all you get.
7938,There is nothing else after you die.
7939,This is it.
7940,You’ll never get another chance to be 16 or 17 or 18.
7941,You’ll never get another chance at prom.
7942,Don’t waste your life making others happy.
7943,That’s an ugly dress.
7944,Why does your boyfriend hate it?
7945,I have never meet a man that has an opinion on women’s fashion unless there is a really good reason for it… like it doesn’t fit well or something.
7946,If it’s not a really good reason like that (which I do not see that being the case because I think it looks lovely) then is he just being mean?
7947,What is his motives for saying he hates it?
7948,"Don’t forget it’s your prom too, have fun for YOU!"
7949,The color is wonderful and it fits you really well.
7950,I think you will look gorgeous in it.
7951,Your boyfriend can shut his pie hole.
7952,Your boyfriend sounds like a child.
7953,That dress is gorgeous.
7954,This dress is gorgeous
7955,Really?
7956,"The prom dress is ok, she can do waaaay better though."
7957,"She could find something that better suits her body type and compliments her skin color more, girl talk to the sales person, they'll know what you need."
7958,I bet y'all require participation trophy's for your kids too.
7959,"Not a mom, but tell him to fuck off."
7960,It’s cute!
7961,And the color pairs nicely with your skin tone
7962,Its a gorgeous dress!!!
7963,It screams classy but still shows enough to not be considered prudie
7964,"Honey, can we both Onyankodon?"
7965,It beautiful and to be honest when I went to prom most of the dresses where extravagant.
7966,Maybe because of the area or the school itself don’t really know.
7967,Is your boyfriend gay?
7968,Why does he need to be a fashionista.
7969,Not a mom but a sister - that dress is gorgeoussssssss!!!
7970,Your bf is trash.
7971,Never listen to a high-school boy about  fashion
7972,Replace the boyfriend not the dress sweetie
7973,Its beautiful.
7974,Tell him to stay home.
7975,Edit: Im a Dad.
7976,Let it go let it go let it go right to the bin!!!
7977,!
7978,Your bf is really strange.
7979,You look very nice.
7980,And that's it.
7981,Wishes from Germany.
7982,When your body is shaped like yours you have limited options.
7983,Covering your shoulders or using a cowl neckline and less poofy skirt.
7984,A shawl would help as well.
7985,Unless he doesn’t like the color or something there’s nothing wrong with it lol
7986,Full send.
7987,"If he doesn’t like it that’s his problem not yours, rock it"
7988,"This is one of the most classy and ""Princessy"" type prom dresses I've seen in a long, long time."
7989,There's nothing wrong with it.
7990,Do you like it?
7991,"You're the one wearing it, and if you like it keep it."
7992,I'd suggest not keeping the boyfriend.
7993,It looks amazing.
7994,But beyond just being supportive think about how it will look with all the other people that are dressed up.
7995,Next to all the other prom dresses it will be unique but not over the top.
7996,You will stand out in the best way.
7997,It’s supposed to be fancy!
7998,You look so beautiful!
7999,I’m getting total Cinderella vibes!
8000,He only thing your boyfriend should be doing is telling you you look beautiful and making sure you have a good time!
8001,"I know teenage boys can really suck and say dumb shit, but I can assure you he is wrong."
8002,You look awesome!
8003,If he’s saying dumb shit like this ditch him and go with friends instead!
8004,I love it!
8005,Looks like Cinderella
8006,I see elegance.
8007,"Don’t second guess yourself, it’s your prom and if you like the dress that is all that matters."
8008,Shine your light.
8009,I know this is mom for a minute.
8010,"But, as a happily married man, if my wife loves her dress."
8011,I love her dress.
8012,"If she's looking for critique, I'll suggest small adjustments, if that."
8013,This young man probably needs to take a similar approach if he really cares about you.
8014,I would be so proud of your choice of dress if you were my daughter.
8015,Dump the loser.
8016,You deserve much better.
8017,That dress is beautiful and it fits you perfectly.
8018,Have a great prom!!!
8019,!
8020,You look like a fairytale - it’s beautiful.
8021,Your opinion matters above all.
8022,Boyfriend is being a little shit.
8023,"Sis, that's a gorgeous dress!"
8024,You look like a fairy!
8025,"Anyone who sees you in it will see your inner magic and shine, or shame on them!"
8026,"Definitely not a waste on the dress, but maybe the wrong boyfriend!"
8027,Fuck him.
8028,Tell him to go pick out his own dress to wear to the prom by himself and to go pound sand in his ass at the after party.
8029,[deleted]
8030,It’s beautiful and you look beautiful in it :)
8031,It’s so beautiful!!!
8032,!
8033,Good news!
8034,Either way prom doesn’t matter.
8035,"That dress is gorgeous, unique, and matches your figure."
8036,"But most of all, did you have that goosebumps moment when you put it on and looked in the mirror?"
8037,"That’s how you know and your boyfriend doesn’t tell you how to dress, it’s your choice."
8038,"If he is t supportive, then that’s really not cool."
8039,Sooooo classy!
8040,Gorgeous.
8041,Since when does a teenage boy have any fashion sense?
8042,You look beautiful!
8043,Strange to me that a guy gives two turtle fucks about you frozen dress.
8044,Just throw it back on some other dood who cares.
8045,"It’s one night for you, you’ll remember it later on,  it’s a beautiful dress."
8046,Enjoy yourself.
8047,I like it
8048,"Looks nice, see no issue."
8049,"Honey that dress looks amazing, you were it very well too."
8050,"Idk what your boyfriends thinking, it’s beautiful"
8051,I’m going to be THAT mom and just sit here giving bf the stink eye.
8052,"Your bf is an asshole for saying that to you, regardless of what the dress even looks like."
8053,Absolutely not !
8054,Do a up hair style!
8055,Some kind of bun on top made pretty .
8056,& Maybe a diamond or fake diamond choker if youre like me ☺️ *excuse my horrible grammer edits
8057,That's a really pretty color for skintone and I love how it goes collar bone.
8058,You're going to look beautiful!
8059,That's a beautiful dress and it will go beautifully with a different date (or none at all).
8060,"Keep the dress, ditch the bf."
8061,"Get a different date, not a different dress."
8062,It's beautiful on you
8063,Both the dress and the fit are beautiful.
8064,"If he chooses to die on that hill, you may have issues."
8065,"If he accepts that you're gonna wear it even though he doesn't like it, then you'll probably be fine."
8066,"As a Dad, I’d have some choice words for that “boyfriend”."
8067,The dress is beautiful!
8068,!
8069,Yes
8070,"Um honestly what your boyfriend might be thinking is it covers to much, like bulky."
8071,"Straps are bulky, it looks almost thick and warm wich guys don't typically like."
8072,He's probably lying looking for something with straps and a V neck.
8073,"But to be honest here, I think you just picked the dress based on what you like and weren't to concerned about if others will enjoy looking at you."
8074,So good on you for being yourself I think it looked great!
8075,"You need a new boyfriend, not a new dress"
8076,I love it.
8077,It's elegant and the color is lovely.
8078,The tulle looks like so much fun.
8079,The important thing is that you're happy with it and it makes you feel beautiful.
8080,Your boyfriend should also make you feel beautiful and keep the negative comments to himself.
8081,It’s stunning!
8082,"Very classy and elegant, really love the off the shoulder sleeve and it hits you at the waits perfectly!"
8083,"Sounds like you need a new date, not a new dress."
8084,Your boyfriend is a fashion idiot.
8085,That dress is so pretty.
8086,Your boyfriend sounds like a future member of Gaslighters of America.
8087,I say ditch him in favor of someone who will support your choices.
8088,That dress is dope
8089,New boyfriend.
8090,Not a new dress.
8091,You look great.
8092,"As a man, young lady you look fabulous!"
8093,"Go out have fun, this is your time to shine!"
8094,"Looks good and if you like it, keep it."
8095,Just keep it.
8096,I mean it’s good.
8097,The bf has his opinion.
8098,you don’t have to completely stop dating him because he says he doesn’t like it.
8099,But you don’t have to drop the dress for the same reason.
8100,Just do what you like it’s not like he’s gonna wear it.
8101,I’m a big sister - this dress looks stunning on you!
8102,"If you like it, that’s all that matters."
8103,You look like a princess and you should feel nothing but beautiful on your prom day!
8104,"Fake positivity is a problem too, you know."
8105,The dress is ugly.
8106,"Keep the dress, lose the boyfriend."
8107,The other moms here are right.
8108,Your opportunities for wearing fancy fluffy princess dresses will be thin on the ground post-graduation.
8109,"You look fabulous, the dress is fabulous, go have a great time!"
8110,It’s beautiful.
8111,"It’s legitimately scary to think this many people are jumping to crazy conclusions based on the sole fact that he doesn’t like your dress, which quite frankly I agree, it looks too old fashioned."
8112,If you wear that dress imma bout to ask you to prom myself
8113,"Girl you look like MOTHERFUCKING CINDERELLA, that dress is GORGEOUS - the embroidery??"
8114,Are you kidding me??
8115,10/10.
8116,Your boyfriend can go kick rocks
8117,"Let it snow,"
8118,"Dump him, it’s tough but that’s a red flag"
8119,Throw the boyfriend away
8120,"The dress is beautiful, tell ur man to stop acting like a bent nail ❤️"
8121,It’s gorgeous.
8122,It fits you so beautifully; drop anyone who says otherwise.
8123,💖
8124,New boyfriends are cheaper than new dresses.
8125,Girl: Do you like the dress?
8126,Boy: No.
8127,Internet: Boy worst person in the world for giving his honest opinion.
8128,Not sure if you posted in this sub for an honest opinion or just to have everyone agree with you but im of the opinion that it fits well and looks good.
8129,The embroidered pattern is cool.
8130,"Personally I'm not a fan of the color, the dress as a whole is a bit old school and i would hope you didn't spend too much on it."
8131,But I would also go so far as to say if you spend your whole life trying to please other people your going to spend your whole life being disappointed.
8132,Wear what's comfortable and makes you feel good.
8133,I have some salmon colored gym shorts that look awful with everything.
8134,Idc I love them.
8135,As far as the boyfriend I know prom is a big deal for both parties and Hollywood hypes it up in a way that adds a lot of pressure so he probably had some preconceived idea of how things would look or go.
8136,All these people are victimizing him and he doesn't sound perfect but he's just a horny kid who makes mistakes and would probably prefer a leather body suit or something.
8137,I think once the night comes and you guys start that first slow dance how your dress looks will be the last thing on anyone's mind.
8138,"But thats a slightly more honest take, if that's not what your after just ignore it."
8139,ITS SO BEAUTIFUL - you look gorgeous I wish I looked this good when I graduated !!!
8140,Keep it and enjoy your day!
8141,Everyone that says otherwise is wrong
8142,I like the dress.
8143,The colour is not 100% nice for me.
8144,But it looks very good on you
8145,"Hey, I've seen a bad prom dress, my date wore what could be described as a dark blue super spy/future Egyptian pullover."
8146,"This is a beautiful prom dress, classic, great colot"
8147,My first thought was that it’s a beautiful dress and that you look great in it.
8148,"This was followed by me thinking it looked kind of cold, not the dress itself but the environment the dress fits."
8149,It’s a beautiful dress but better suited for a winter event with snow rather than a warm springtime party.
8150,"Then I started humming, “Let it go."
8151,Let it go.”
8152,Oh honey no .
8153,It’s beautiful .
8154,You look absolutely gorgeous in it ❤️.
8155,Stop worrying about what other people think.
8156,"Discarding their feelings, do you love it?"
8157,it's beautiful and your boyfriend is an idiot.
8158,all he should have gotten from this dress is a que of what colour tie and corsage to get.
8159,don't worry about him.
8160,"Dare I say, he's probably going to ruin the night to begin with."
8161,you do you.
8162,"enjoy this special night on your terms, with your friends."
8163,"you won't be dating him come a year, let alone getting married to him"
8164,I freakin love that dress!
8165,The detail is wonderful and the color is awesome.
8166,Your boyfriend could learn to keep his mouth shut :)
8167,"Gorgeous, darling!"
8168,How can a dress be “too much” for prom?
8169,It looks so lovely!
8170,I love that color.
8171,"Your bf on the other hand really sucks, I bet he doesn't look 1/8th as good as you."
8172,I love your dress.
8173,"I love the colour, I love how perfectly it fits."
8174,You look amazing.
8175,"Seriously sweetie, you are stunning."
8176,"Your boyfriend on the other hand seems like an ass, it's fine to not like a style but anyone worth your time would never hurt your feelings like that."
8177,"Keep the dress, reconsider the boy."
8178,"Ditch the bf, keep the dress!"
8179,It's gorgeous!
8180,You look like a princess
8181,Well he can always wear a black eye to prom.
8182,That's dress is freaking gorgeous!
8183,"Keep the dress, dump the boyfriend."
8184,"Oh my god, seriously love that dress."
8185,It’s beautiful
8186,It’s a gorgeous dress and it looks great on you!!!
8187,If you can afford a strapless bra it would showcase your shoulders/bust area more!
8188,"If you can’t find a good bra, then try hiding the straps of your current bra under the sleeves of your dress!"
8189,That’s what I do and I still get enough support!
8190,:) Your BF is an idiot.
8191,"The dress is gorgeous,  has a very Disney princess feel to it."
8192,It looks amazing on your skin tone.
8193,It is very timeless.
8194,Your boyfriend is an idiot.
8195,I suggest finding someone who makes you feel pretty even in an old t-shirt and shorts.
8196,Not a mom but… What??
8197,You look like Cinderella what are you talking about.
8198,You shouldn’t be taking this personal.
8199,I love that woman are jumping in to lift you up but that dress ain’t it.
8200,If your boyfriend wore something you hated you should let him know as well because honesty is important.
8201,Also is he forcing you to get rid of it?
8202,Or did he just express that he hated it?
8203,"I’m late to the comments, but I love the dress!"
8204,It’s looks very nice!
8205,I love this dress!!
8206,"Fuck your “boyfriend,” I wish I could chew him out."
8207,You look gorgeous!
8208,!
8209,Wear it and love it!
8210,It’s beautiful!
8211,Hope you have a great night!
8212,"The dress is nice, tell your boyfriend to ~ let it go"
8213,Its breathtaking.
8214,"I don't think the boyfriend will match up to the beauty in front of him, though."
8215,Get a new boyfriend.
8216,Nah girl you look fine with it 😜
8217,"I'm not generally a fan of dresses, but this one actually looks quite nice"
8218,I personally love it.
8219,Prom is supposed to be formal yet a tad extra (IMO) which is what this is to me.
8220,I think it’s really pretty and you look great.
8221,The color is beautiful.
8222,"Boyfriend hates it because it’s not skin tight and revealing, how is he suppose to impress his homies"
8223,This dress is so much more interesting than the same styles of prom dresses I see with the sequin bodice and limp tulle skirt or those high-low cut dresses with the tacky large plastic gems on the front.
8224,"I love how different this dress is because it’s so classic, detailed, and elegant."
8225,"It looks gorgeous and if you like it, wear it."
8226,"I know if I saw your dress at prom, I would be envious of your style."
8227,You have great taste!
8228,And I wouldn’t worry if you’re too overdressed.
8229,It’s prom.
8230,There are very few other occasions in life when you get to dress up in formal gowns and evening wear like this - make the most of it and do what makes you feel beautiful!
8231,"Even though I’m not the biggest fan of the color, I do think it’s a gorgeous dress!"
8232,"I love the beadwork, and it fits you so well."
8233,"If you feel good in it, you should wear it!"
8234,"I only went to prom once and wore a dress I hated, but that my (now-ex)boyfriend and my mother liked."
8235,Don’t make my mistake!
8236,Wear what makes *you* happy because it’s *your* experience at prom.
8237,"What others wear makes way less of an impact on your individual experiences, so boyfriend can shove it."
8238,It’s gorgeous!!
8239,!
8240,"As long as you like it, thats what matters!"
8241,"Whole boyfriend

V

🗑️

Also love the dress ❤️"
8242,"Dress is beautiful, boyfriend is ugly."
8243,"Sis, that dress is beautiful."
8244,"I dunno what your boyfriend’s problem is, but your dress fits you like a dream and it’s so cute."
8245,Don’t live your life to please others.
8246,"Live your life to please yourself, and right now it sounds like your boyfriend isn’t being very pleasant to you."
8247,"Your dress is very pretty, and honestly, it’s very unusual/weird for a boy to “hate” a dress so much so that he tells his girlfriend about it."
8248,How would he feel if when he shows up in his “unique” tux you told him “I hate what your wearing.”?
8249,He’d feel bad.
8250,And why would you honestly say such a thing?
8251,"Unless…

This is about him hurting you on a very special occasion."
8252,"If you’re with someone, you don’t hurt them on a special occasion over something so trivial unless you just…."
8253,don’t like them but are to insecure (lack the courage) to tell yourself and them the truth.
8254,"Sweetie, he’s either a fool or he isn’t being honest with you."
8255,You need to figure out which it is.
8256,"You will have other boyfriends, but you will only ever have one or two proms."
8257,"Hey, I looked through your comments for some more context and I think I can understand where your boyfriend is coming from— it is quite an extravagant dress, he may be overwhelmed by it or realize he’ll have to match your style more by dressing up."
8258,"*But*, so what?"
8259,"Prom is your chance to dress up however you want, and it’s practically encouraged to dress like a princess."
8260,"I regret toning down my prom dress, because I work in a field/live in a community that will never afford me the opportunity to dress up like that ever again."
8261,"I fantasize about wearing extravagant gowns all the time, haha!"
8262,"Use this chance to feel like the gorgeous, elegant person you certainly look like in that dress, & enjoy your prom!"
8263,"Also, that color is divine."
8264,Excellent choice.
8265,That dress is gorgeous and it looks beautiful on you.
8266,The neckline is devine and those lace decals are so pretty.
8267,It's pretty.
8268,Find a new boyfriend.
8269,gotta agree with the bf
8270,Dump the BF and keep the dress!
8271,It's perfect!
8272,I like it.
8273,"Beautiful, he doesn’t know what he has."
8274,I posted an update :) for anybody who wants to see it.
8275,Thank you so much for all the support guys
8276,"I am not a mom but I am a woman and I love your dress...

As long as you feel beautiful and comfortable in it, go for it!"
8277,Your boyfriend's opinion doesn't matter here.
8278,Ask yourself the above questions and make your decision based on that!
8279,Enjoy your prom!
8280,"No, it’s beautiful honey."
8281,"Hon, you look lovely."
8282,The dress fits perfectly and I love it.
8283,Your bf has no taste in clothes.
8284,I think you look like Cinderella and your boyfriend needs to work on the filter between his brain and his mouth.
8285,"Like it's good to be honest with you, that's not a bad thing."
8286,But he can be honest about that in a more kind way.
8287,Hate is a strong word that should be reserved for things that are not prom dresses.
8288,I'm so sorry that you found something that you love and the people around you didn't love it.
8289,That sucks.
8290,You look beautiful.
8291,"And if you do wear it, spend time working on the bra part ahead of time."
8292,It can be really hard to find a comfortable strapless bra and you deserve to be comfortable all night.
8293,My boyfriend dressed like Willy Wonka for prom and at first I resisted but came to accept it and I just don't look at the photos ever and everything is fine.
8294,I'm glad that he felt good.
8295,You look about a hundred times better than Willy Wonka.
8296,"Dump the boyfriend, keep this dress."
8297,You look stunning and will look back on pictures of yourself from prom with pride!
8298,"That dress is gorgeous, sis!!"
8299,You're going to turn heads!
8300,"Don't listen to him, he doesn't know what he's doing with fashion :)"
8301,Dear one that dress is lovely and you are lovely in it!
8302,The color is gorgeous and really suits you.
8303,Your BF is likely picturing prom looks that are from several years ago.
8304,"Not a mom, (maybe I can be a sister?)"
8305,but this dress is  absolutely -stunning~!
8306,"It’s super unique, the color is beautiful and something I’d pick out for myself too."
8307,It’s a very classy and elegant choice IMHO.
8308,"Your boyfriend just doesn’t have good taste apparently, and sounds like maybe he isn’t as supportive as he should be."
8309,But back to the dress - the pearls!
8310,You could get a pearl necklace that would look super cool.
8311,And the green would look really nice with the flower pieces you get for each other (I forget what they are called).
8312,Very eucalyptus vibes ya know?
8313,Edit: I wish I could tell past-me to pick something more like this for prom instead of the basic dress I chose.
8314,"Future you will thank you for sticking with the dress you like, ESPECIALLY this one."
8315,"The dress is beautiful, elegant, fits you well, and the color suits you."
8316,"It may not be prom-y in the way your boyfriend thinks about prom, but it's absolutely appropriate for prom."
8317,"Your boyfriend might be stuck in a mindset about what is and isn't prom appropriate based entirely on tv and movies, Instagram, and a handful of arbiters at your high school who have made superficial pronouncements about prom impropriety."
8318,"Unless he's a fashion designer, see Zac Posen, your boyfriend probably has no clue what he's talking about."
8319,"As a caveat, I'll add that I don't think Zac Posen was all that adept at his craft during his high school years, but he was continually designing dresses for supermodels during this period and it gave him the imprimatur of competence and brilliance that weren't exactly well earned."
8320,"The dress is gorgeous, I’m sorry your boyfriend isn’t a fan - no accounting for taste I guess?"
8321,It’s fairytale in the best possible way and it looks like it suits you perfectly!
8322,Quality advice sub lol
8323,This gives whimsical princess vibes.
8324,I love this colour it suits you :)
8325,Gorgeous dress.
8326,I hope you will feel as beautiful as you look.
8327,"As for your bf, well, as my father used to say ""Everyone is entitled to their erroneous opinion""."
8328,It’s a beautiful dress on a beautiful girl.
8329,"If it makes you feel happy, and beautiful, and like the confident princess you’re meant to be, then absolutely no one else’s opinion matters."
8330,"Prom night and your wedding night are the two big opportunities a girl has to feel like the princess she deserves to be, and that means wearing what makes you feel comfortable and beautiful, regardless of what other people think."
8331,"If your boyfriend has negative things to say about something that brings you joy, maybe you should think about the rest of his behaviour, though?"
8332,"Do you feel like he consistently lifts you up, and this is an exception, or do you feel like he often puts you down and makes you feel sad or worried about things you enjoy?"
8333,"You deserve a partner who is kind to you and cares about the things you care about just as much as you deserve to feel like a princess for your prom, hun."
8334,"I don’t want to give you solid advice on that, because I of course don’t know your relationship, but just do a bit of thinking about it, okay?"
8335,You look like Cinderella!!
8336,"It's stunning 😍 don't listen to that idiot, and maybe consider getting a new bf 😅

Love your big sister ❤️"
8337,I wouldve choked on my own spit if I saw that dress when I went dress shopping for prom.
8338,I wanted a Cinderella ball gown SO BAD.
8339,"Sweetbean, don’t let people tear you down, is he wearing the dress?"
8340,Is it hurting anyone?
8341,Does it hurt you?
8342,No?
8343,Then he can impolitely fuck off.
8344,"Even if it WAS ugly or bad or whatever, no good boyfriend would make you insecure about it because partners are supposed to make you happy and lift you up."
8345,"Ditch him for your friends at prom, I guarantee youll have a much better time."
8346,This dress looks stunning.
8347,I immediately thought of a Disney princess when I saw the photos.
8348,I hope you disregard your boyfriend’s opinions and wear it.
8349,"Not a mom, but I think it’s beautiful- wouldn’t wear it to a prom though, maybe to a wedding."
8350,"At the same time, people are allowed to not like certain clothes, I’m not sure why your bf is being called out in such a mean way."
8351,I’m sure everyone has their own preferences when it comes to clothing
8352,"I hate the dress, but not as much as the thread."
8353,"OP, you look like a literal princess."
8354,That gown is amazing and it fits you like it was made for you.
8355,"This is a great opportunity to learn about how the people we choose as partners should be supportive and improve our life, not critical and upsetting."
8356,"I know this is only a snapshot of your relationship, but OP, take some time to seriously consider this please and always remember to stand up for yourself, set boundaries and end relationships if they are not good for you."
8357,Did you like it before you got his opinion?
8358,What did it make you feel?
8359,What made you buy it?
8360,The only thing that matters is whether you like it and that it makes you feel beautiful.
8361,"Personally, the only dance I went to I chose a dress out of panic and ended up being the 6th girl at the dance."
8362,"So if I could go back I would have chosen the dress that made me feel butterflies, the one that lit up my smile, fit the vibe I wanted."
8363,So the next major dress I bought was my wedding dress.
8364,My friend and my mother took pictures..
8365,"I chose based on what vibe, what it made me feel, like, did I feel like I was playing a dress up bride?"
8366,"or did I feel like the bride, and the butterflies and smile?"
8367,It was fasinating looking at those pictures bc even tho I debated a little bit.. in the pictures you can see exactly how it was the one!
8368,I debated the dress bc I had a friend in my ear that was telling me the puffy sparkly one..
8369,"I really liked it, I felt beautiful but it wasn't me."
8370,It was my friend's dream dress.
8371,I really had to step away from her opinion and connect with my feelings about the dress.
8372,"So take the boyfriend out of the picture, do you feel beautiful, does it feel like the dress was made for you?"
8373,"If not it's perfectly okay to return it, but if you do then wear it knowing that you are absolutely gorgeous.. that anything you wear is stunning but this dress is made for you and your entire being regardless of how he sees it."
8374,"Lastly, if he cannot be supportive of you and your feelings despite different tastes, if he doesn't make you feel appreciated and beautiful even if he doesn't like the dress, then he needs to go."
8375,You deserve someone who is in awe of you whether you wear a potato sack or are covered in diamonds.
8376,"Know your worth babe, and remember you make the dress, the dress doesn't make you."
8377,I personally think you look classic beautiful in the dress a little vintage you could do pinup hair and it would set you apart from everyone.
8378,"Love, your internet mom💓"
8379,"Keep the dress, ditch the boy."
8380,"Seriously, that dress is fabulous!"
8381,You have great taste!
8382,Why are you listening to a teenage boy about fashion?
8383,They barely shower enough!
8384,"Either he is negging you (in which case he's an asshole and you should dump him immediately) or he's really, really stupid and needs to learn to keep his mouth shut about things he knows nothing about."
8385,Keep the dress; maybe ditch the boy.
8386,It looks beautiful.
8387,This is a stunning dress and it look great on you.
8388,everyone has their own opinions and no one should ever try to force theirs on someone else.
8389,"That being said, your bf is being ridiculous."
8390,"wear what you like, do what you enjoy and tell him to shove it."
8391,Wow!
8392,That dress looks incredible on you!!!!
8393,Screw your bf he apparently doesn't have eyes
8394,Looks Gucci to me idk bout your bf
8395,"Most important thing first:
Sweetheart, I think this dress is beautiful."
8396,"A classic off-the-shoulder dress like that is perfect with hair cut short or pinned up (to show off that whole neckline-to-shoulder region) or with long hair down, so it works well with literally ANY hairstyle/cut."
8397,Excellent choice.
8398,"If I were you, I would look for a necklace that's a little sparkly and has maybe a longer chain, OR go on the short side and keep it around your collarbone."
8399,"Now let's talk about that boy:
I have serious concerns about anyone throwing shade on a dress that is inspired by Cinderella's ball gown, and by extension, the girl who friend ""the dress."""
8400,"After all, you're not getting dressed up for him."
8401,You're getting dressed up for YOU.
8402,How sure are you that you really care about this boy?
8403,"And, completely separate from how much you may care for him, how do you feel about him undermining your confidence and putting you down this way?"
8404,"Some people are so insecure that they're significant other will leave them, that they use little put-downs like this to undermine your confidence."
8405,"(After all, in their mind, you might leave them for a better option!"
8406,"The safest thing for them is to make you feel a little less valuable, so you stick with them as a ""prize."")"
8407,"Some adults do this and their relationships, and it's awful."
8408,"Those adults don't flip a switch overnight, it starts younger than that."
8409,"I'm not saying this person is necessarily a controlling / mentally abusive partner, but I'm saying it's a red flag."
8410,Please look out for more.
8411,"It is entirely possible to have somebody in your heart that is no good for you, or that doesn't care for you back in equal measure, and that is a very hard place to be."
8412,"Speaking from experience, it is entirely okay to go to the prom solo and just dance with your friends."
8413,"I went solo to my junior prom, and it was SO much more fun than the senior prom with a boy stuck on my arm."
8414,He does not own your night.
8415,He does not own your fashion choices.
8416,He does not own your fun.
8417,It’s a lovely dress.
8418,He’s a little boy and doesn’t know any better.
8419,Stunning!!!
8420,Absolutely stunning.
8421,This is one of the most beautiful dresses I've ever seen.
8422,"If you're going to regret or exchange anything, make it the boyfriend."
8423,Give him a new title.
8424,The ex.
8425,"You will remember the dress in 20 years, and not the condescend boyfriend."
8426,Wear what you want and what you feel good and enjoy the night.
8427,I LOVE that dress!
8428,"If I had 1000's to pick from, I would pick this one."
8429,"Boyfriends/friends/family should lift you up, not put you down."
8430,"I love that on you, dear."
8431,"It looks like a princess dress, which is just what you are."
8432,The blue goes well with your skin tone.
8433,"Don’t let some stuck-up prince tell you otherwise, there are plenty of other knights willing to vanquish beasts for you."
8434,"All in all, though, I love it on you!"
8435,!
8436,Keep the dress.
8437,Return the boyfriend.
8438,Will he be wearing a tux?
8439,"If not, that may be the source of his down vote on the dress."
8440,"Lately, am seeing weddings that are very formal with a bride in an incredible gown while the groom and his best man are dressed in jeans and a jacket."
8441,not a mom but girl you look like a princess!!
8442,love love love the dress!
8443,!
8444,The dress looks amazing on you!
8445,I love the color and the embroidery on it!
8446,Maybe your boyfriend is worried that whatever he has chosen to wear to prom wont be as amazing as you will be.
8447,"But that's ok, you two will have a wonderful night together!"
8448,Have fun and make safe choices!
8449,"Imma be real honest with you, to me it looks lovely."
8450,"It's not quite sexy or ""modern"" in a way, but rather has a timeless beauty and honestly is really really beautiful."
8451,I love the decorations and the colour goes very well.
8452,"I would go no Jewelry because the dress is decorated enough, maybe a simple bracelet, and make sure you have one colour (possibly nude or white/silver) shoes!"
8453,I think it's cute
8454,I think that it’s a beautiful dress!
8455,Why do you regret it?
8456,"I think this is a dress a woman buys for herself, to feel amazing in and look beautiful."
8457,It isn't a dress suited to a certain type of immature male gaze that prizes blatant sexuality over all else.
8458,"The dress is wonderful and if you love it please wear it, I wish I had had such elegant taste when I was young."
8459,It’s a beautiful dress!
8460,I’m not sure what his problem is.
8461,Oh it is absolutely beautiful!
8462,You look stunning in that dress.
8463,Don’t let anyone tell you what you should ands should not like.
8464,If you love the dress then wear it proudly!
8465,Gawd that gorgeous!
8466,Wish I could have afforded something so nice when I was her age…this is also perfect timing for a life lesson!
8467,I love it!
8468,!
8469,"I think it’s beautiful but if you’re second guessing, go try on some more dresses!"
8470,"Nah, its cute!"
8471,You look magical and the colour is beautiful.
8472,"The most important part is that you feel good in the dress, not what he thinks about it"
8473,It’s magical.
8474,Do you sis and don’t mind the haters.
8475,Sorry they hurt you—they should definitely be on your team.
8476,♥️
8477,OMG!!!
8478,NO!
8479,This looks fantastic on you!
8480,"I would love something like this as a wedding dress, sis!"
8481,It's so fairy tale-elven like.
8482,"Even if it's not that style, why is he such a dick about it,?"
8483,He should be supportive and not put you down.
8484,"Stay proud, don't let him insult you dear."
8485,"I like that one better than my old prom dress... that's so pretty, I *love* the color and embroidery 

Fuck your boyfriend for telling you that."
8486,You look fucking gorgeous honey!
8487,"I’m a guy, that’s a beautiful dress"
8488,I LOVE IT!
8489,You look so gorgeous baby.
8490,I'm absolutely in love with it!!!
8491,😍
8492,Get a new boyfriend.
8493,You chose the dress and spent your money on it for a reason.
8494,It looks good and fits well.
8495,Do what makes you happy.
8496,Your dress is beautiful.
8497,BF wants something sexy?
8498,"Tight and showing a lot of skin, as well as glittery and shiny."
8499,"Doesn't speak well of him, does it?"
8500,"Everything about this dress is beautiful, especially you."
8501,"💜 

I really like the neckline/draped sleeve and embroidery together."
8502,And the colour is perfect!
8503,Absolutely gorgeous!
8504,When we were in school I went to prom and homecoming with my current husband.
8505,"Not only did he never criticize my dresses, he'd actually ask me what HE should wear so he'd match whatever dress I chose."
8506,Looking back (if I'm totally honest) I had some UGLY dresses (I hand-sewed them myself using old 80's thrift shop dresses for fabric because I grew up poor) but I loved them ...so he loved them too... and we owned the look together!
8507,But I could've shown up in a trash bag and he would've happily tied on a matching one and defended the choice to anyone that gave us crap for it.
8508,He ALWAYS had my back (and still does!).
8509,"That being said, you are incredibly lucky to have such a beautiful dress."
8510,"The beadwork and details are stunning, the color is gorgeous and it fits you beautifully."
8511,"I hope your date learns to support you and your choices instead of being critical, but this is definitely a ""him"" problem, not a ""you"" problem."
8512,:::hugs:::
8513,How do YOU FEEL in this dress?
8514,That's the only question that matters here sis/little cuz.
8515,I get why you asked what you did how you did.
8516,"Prom is a big thing and, when we're in relationships, we always want them to be happy."
8517,However.
8518,You picked this for a reason.
8519,"To my eye, the color and shape are flattering on you...but you picked this for you because of how you feel in it and felt it strongly enough to spend money you had access to on it."
8520,Your boyfriend does not get a say in what makes you feel good about yourself.
8521,He does not get to try to make you feel insecure.
8522,He does not get to dictate how you spend your money.
8523,Does he want to enjoy the privilege of accompanying your fabulous looking self to the function or stay home?
8524,This should be the only question he should be asking and he should be asking it of himself.
8525,Re-evaluate what he's bringing to your life and have a backup plan for going without him.
8526,We love you.
8527,Please change the boyfriend and not the dress.
8528,"Dress looks beautiful, fits you so well, and you look like a princess 💕"
8529,You look so beautiful in your dress.
8530,It fits amazing and the colour is so unusual but stunning!
8531,If you love the dress and feel great in it that’s all that matters xxx
8532,Absolutely not sweetheart!
8533,You look divine and if  that idiot boy can’t see that then he doesn’t deserve you!
8534,"From the beading to the pattern and everything else is beautiful to me, I hope he is able to understand how much you like your choice and is able to support it, if not there are people that will."
8535,It’s lovely!
8536,He’s a dumb boy!
8537,A new boyfriend might be cheaper than a new dress.
8538,Uncle Wookie here.
8539,Your boyfriends a dick.
8540,That is a perfectly lovely dress.
8541,Not every prom dress has to look like it came from CW teen drama tv show.
8542,"Yours has style, class, an appreciation for flowers."
8543,It's damn near fairytale without being blatant about it.
8544,But he needs to learn a lesson.
8545,If he wants a different dress.
8546,Give him one.
8547,Bwahahaha.
8548,"Go to a goodwill find a perfectly horrible dress, adorn it with Christmas decorations and bows."
8549,And some tasteless costume jewelry.
8550,And feathers it needs feathers.
8551,And threaten him with this one.
8552,That'll teach him.
8553,[BwahahahaAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHA](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oLtFUWzpKQE)
8554,Looks nice to me!

8556,Your dress is a gorgeous color and style!
8557,I'd be delighted to have it!
8558,"Bad resolution, Great dress…~45M"
8559,Is he planning to wear it?
8560,"🤔 

Looks perfectly fine, if you like it that's all that matters."
8561,Looks awesome
8562,Do you love it?
8563,That’s the only thing that counts here.
8564,You look absolutely gorgeous.
8565,It fits your curves perfectly.
8566,"If your boyfriend doesn't appreciate your choice, he's a jerk."
8567,Darling the dress is absolutely lovely.
8568,I spent way too much time caring way too much about others opinions about my clothes.
8569,Don’t be like me.
8570,"If you like it and it makes you happy, wear it and shine!"
8571,"You look beautiful, drop the boyfriend and go with some great girl friends and have fun!"
8572,That dress is beautiful on you!!!
8573,The cut is so flattering and the embroidery is gorgeous!!
8574,"Prom was the only time I got to wear poofy dresses, outside of my wedding."
8575,Don’t miss your opportunity!!!
8576,"Also, make sure to get some solo pictures!!"
8577,A boyfriend who tries to control what you wear might not enhance the pictures as you get older 😉
8578,It’s beautiful!
8579,"Take the dress, leave the bf."
8580,It’s pretty !
8581,Whet the fook is wrkng  n with your BF anyway?
8582,He ain’t wearing it !

8591,who *cares* what some man thinks!
8592,go rock that beautiful dress!
8593,You look pretty good in the dress!
8594,"You look adorable, your boyfriend sounds like a dumbass and please for heavens sake dont regret this."
8595,"Since wen do guys gaf

8596,i’m a senior getting ready for prom too and this dress is so cute do NOT regret it.

8599,You are beautiful.
8600,I absolutely love it.
8601,It fits you well and I love that color against your skin.
8602,It is beautiful on you.
8603,Your boyfriend is wrong and a jerk for making you feel insecure against about your choices.
8604,I actually really like the dress and you look beautiful in it.
8605,If your boyfriend wants to criticize what you wear then I'll be your new boyfriend ;)
8606,"Your boyfriend is either blind, stupid, or both."
8607,That dress is gorgeous.
8608,A boyfriend that makes you feel insecure can be referenced as an ex
8609,You look stunning and your shape looks great!
8610,Tiny waist!
8611,Great color!
8612,SUPER CUTE FAIRY PRINCESS!!
8613,"Wear it, and wear it OFTEN!!!"

8626,Ditch him long and ditch him hard.
8627,Ain’t no one got time for any man that don’t support you.
8628,Especially when you rock something that hard!
8629,You in that dress rock!
8630,"Trust me on this- you don’t need no one bringing you down, honey."
8631,You stand alone much better than with anyone dragging yo ass down unnecessarily!
8632,This dress looks super similar to my wedding dress.
8633,I’m 23 btw.
8634,"So I’m biased, it looks amazing!"
8635,!
8636,Girl this is gorgeous.
8637,You deserve a better guy!
8638,"My first reaction was (outloud), ""oh, it's gorgeous!"""
8639,You look a million bucks and deserve to feel like it too.
8640,Ditch the boyfriend - he sounds like dead weight.
8641,"I like it, it’s a really nice color and I like the lacy part in the top."
8642,Beautiful dress OP!
8643,🤍✨ Perfect color & perfect fit!
8644,Hubby says it looks good.
8645,"That dress is gorgeous and looks great on you

Tell your BF he can choose which dress HE wears to prom but not yours"
8646,omg!!
8647,you look like cinderella i love it
8648,You look beautiful
8649,Gorgeous 😍.
8650,I know this is an old post.
8651,It I just saw it and wanted to say I LOVE this dress.
8652,It’s gorgeous.
8653,"Showed it to my daughter with whom I just went prom dress shopping, and she also loves it."
8654,I think it is stunning!
8655,"It is such a flattering style, it looks like a dress that would always be in fashion."
8656,"Your bf gets zero say in what you wear or how you look, EVER."
8657,[removed]
8658,Is the boyfriend not aloud to have an opinion?
8659,Y’all acting like he’s beating her
8660,This are incredibly blind responses lol.
8661,Your BF is fine to have an opinion on your dress.
8662,It isn’t a great looking prom dress in my opinion.
8663,I think a lot of other choices would be a good idea.
8664,Everyone saying your Bf Is rude or needs to be replaced is giving you terrible advice.
8665,100% that is not a reason to consider “replacing” someone like I’ve seen people saying.
8666,So cringe.
8667,Get the dress you feel confident in.
8668,"If it isn’t this one, move on and find another."
8669,It's got Disney princess vibes.
8670,Or quincerina coming of age.
8671,Not 18 year old sexy  glamour.
8672,Unless you want to be conservative and not sexy.
8673,"It looks bad because you’re so pudgy, sweetheart."
8674,Try to start having some respect for your body!
8675,You only get one body in life :)
8676,All of this!
8677,"Plus the dress has a very classic, timeless feel to it."
8678,You’ll be able to look at picture of this dress in 20 years and still love it!
8679,"The boy may or may not still be in your life in 20 years, but the confidence and happiness you experience NOW will last forever."
8680,Came here to say this exactly.
8681,It looks glorious and is perfect for prom.
8682,"I would not wear it to the supermarket, but a prom seems like a fitting occasion to me."
8683,Did he state he hated this dress or did he think this dress is too grand compared to what the other girls will be wearing?
8684,"Like, are most of the other girls wearing gowns or cocktail dresses."
8685,This looks like a very classy dress for a classy young lady.
8686,And that might just be the source of his concerns: this isn't the dress of a girl making out (or more) in the grass at the end of the prom.
8687,Ha yes!
8688,"OP- YOU LOOK SO GOOD

If your boyfriend won't shut up about this and apologize for making you doubt yourself, I think he's the one that needs to be exchanged for something better 👍🏻"
8689,She looks elegant.
8690,I thoroughly enjoy whatever the beaded shoulder jawns are called.
8691,Thats a dress made by a fairy godmother
8692,I so agree.
8693,He is projecting something on you.
8694,You need to get to the bottom of it.
8695,A good boyfriend wouldn't care if you showed up to prom in sweats and a cumberbund.
8696,This isn't about a dress.
8697,"Good luck, dear!"
8698,Nothing else to say but this.
8699,100%
8700,Boyfriend bad when he does not tell me what I want to hear?
8701,Oh dear...
8702,Everything is subjective.
8703,What you find appealing may not appeal to the next person.
8704,It has nothing to do about insecurity.
8705,[removed]
8706,"since the world isn't all roses and rainbows, the other side of the coin also exists."
8707,"it's definitely not sleek, trendy, or stylishly modern."
8708,it has the unfortunate effect of looking like it was dug out of an attic.
8709,"i can totally understand someone disliking this dress, and it's okay to have that opinion."
8710,"you may be missing the point that she wants *other* people to think she looks good, which has the effect of making her comfortable in the dress."
8711,don't set the poor girl up for failure.
8712,"if she doesn't feel like ""owning it"" in a lurid dress, don't convince her it's her job to do so."
8713,i know we all want to upvote all these positive vibes comments but it's totally inappropriate to force the square peg in the round hole all the time.
8714,I think it’s qt
8715,You know what nobody needs?
8716,"A partner that is not allowed or willing to give any actual feedback because it might be construed at ""making you feel insecure""."
8717,So the boyfriend is not allowed to not like her choices?
8718,What kind of insane world do you live in?
8719,Do you even hear yourself and how completely bonkers that notion is?
8720,"The dress looks pretty meh, it looks like something out of the 50s, in a meh way."
8721,"If she likes it then fine, but dont tell people they are not allowed to not like it, especially her boyfriend who should be first in line to be asked about it and who should be freely allowed to comment on it!"
8722,You are crazy.
8723,The materials look cheapish
8724,So he should lie ?
8725,Gotcha.
8726,"Jesus christ you're so ready to hate on someone from just a 2nd hand, subjective opinion of his impression of her dress."
8727,It's fucking high-school...none of them are going to be perfect.
8728,Stop trying to jade her against her current bf and let her enjoy her prom without trying to incite her to break up.
8729,What the fuck is with reddit and immediately telling women to leave their partners?
8730,It is endemic and everywhere.
8731,Has nobody on this site been in a relationship that survived a rough patch or a simple quarrel?
8732,Amen!
8733,It’s stunning and it really complements your figure.
8734,The embroidery is beautiful and the color is classic.
8735,Your bf can shove it.
8736,You’ll look great at the dance - have fun!
8737,(From a big sister who would tell your bf to “shove it” to his face for you if I could).
8738,It's absolutely charming.
8739,The color is great and it fits you perfectly.
8740,The embroidery is lovely adds interest to the whole dress.
8741,I'd keep the dress and ditch the boyfriend.
8742,Absolutely!
8743,Looks fantastic.
8744,"Rock that thing at prom OP, you queen!"
8745,Thisssss.
8746,He doesn’t know shit about dresses.
8747,"Keep the dress, yeet the bf."
8748,It’s a good thing he’s not wearing it!
8749,"If he doesn't like it, tell him not to be with you in prom and make some great memories with your friends!!"
8750,They're going to last you longer than that idiot of a bf.
8751,Pretty sure its one of the most important roles of a boyfriend to directly state that anything that falls above barely passable or higher for clothing is to reffered to as beautiful.
8752,"Even if he paid for it, he should buy her the dress she wants and feels good in."
8753,"He's just a kid, though."
8754,Hopefully he'll get wiser.
8755,Lmao
8756,"Momcels, the new subreddit."
8757,There's no need to vilify anyone.
8758,You do realise OP quite probably asked her boyfriend for his opinion (duh) and he gave her his.
8759,And he's not wrong.
8760,The dress looks dated to anyone born after 1995.
8761,Jeez.
8762,"OP themself mentions ""it's true no one has worn anything close to this""."
8763,"The opinions of your peers is important and a single comment from someone at prom (""ugh what is she wearing"") can destroy you."
8764,I think the color and he says it’s too much for prom.
8765,Holup.
8766,"Did he *actually* say that he hates your dress, or are you perhaps extrapolating from a comment that he made?"
8767,Theres an important distinction here.
8768,Confidence is the best accessory!!!
8769,This dress is badass and fits you really well.
8770,"Someone said pearls, and I’m feeling that."
8771,Have so much fun.
8772,Totally agree!
8773,Dress is stunning!
8774,I want one - just to wear around the house to make myself feel good.
8775,It’s absolutely beautiful!
8776,"Colour, design, fit, everything!"
8777,Does he have eyes?!
8778,The dress is beautiful - and such a great color.
8779,">a whole news-stand of issues

Love it."
8780,"He doesn’t just have issues, he has entire subscriptions"
8781,"""Time magazine wants a word because he surpassed them for number of issues"" was my go to, but this one is amazing."
8782,Real talk.
8783,It's gorgeous fam.
8784,If he doesn't like it too bad there's plenty of jaws to drop without his.
8785,"Much love
   Big Bro"
8786,We usually are.
8787,Yes.
8788,"OP, plz return the boyfriend wherever you found him, wear the beautiful dress, and feel beautiful while knowing thousand of people disagree with your boyfriends (ignorant) opinion."
8789,You can have an opinion and that does not make you an issue.
8790,She shouldn't have asked him if she didn't want his opinion.
8791,"You're not obligated to say that you love everything your partner wears, you're not a yes man/woman"
8792,How can you assume that from the title?
8793,All we know from the title is that he has a different taste in dresses than you do.
8794,"At best, that’s one issue."
8795,>a whole news-stand of issues.
8796,First time reading this and I love it.
8797,@OP  Dress is amazing btw
8798,youre the one with issues if you think the bf not liking the dress is anything other than normal.
8799,it's a simple opinion.
8800,Is this teenage boy you know literally nothing about full of issues or is the lonely woman trying to psychoanalyze a teenage boy you know nothing about full of issues...?
8801,He has issues just because he dislikes a dress?
8802,"Yeah, fuck that guy for having a difference in opinion."
8803,SO's should be yes men only.
8804,But it looks like a tablecloth
8805,Is her boyfriend not allowed an opinion?
8806,This!
8807,It actually looks pretty similar to the live action Cinderella movie dress.
8808,None of my frito chili either!!
8809,No amazing mom-made food for this boy!
8810,He can forget about my smores cake cause he can't have any!
8811,And none of the brisket either.
8812,He can sit and watch everyone else eat a food homemade meal while he eats a hot pocket.
8813,Because he is a sad hot pocket its hot on the outside and frozen in the middle.
8814,I second this mom for a minute cookbook ^ - ^
8815,I-i really want lasagna:(
8816,He’s a boyfriend not a well versed style consultant.
8817,Tell him to stay in his lane.
8818,Dad here.
8819,"I think he's being a jerk, but he did say something I agree with."
8820,"If you want to wear it (and it sounds like you do), you should."
8821,No matter what he or anyone else thinks.
8822,"I don't really know much about dresses, but it looks great to me!"
8823,"""No one has ever worn anything close to this""

That's definitely not true."
8824,"If you go to any store and ask for ""prom dress"" they will give you many different - but similarly extravagant - dresses."
8825,Prom dresses are your once in a life time chance to wear a dress that extravagant - besides your wedding.
8826,"Tell him that Reddit has come together, and in a display nearly nonexistent in this era of history, unanimously agreed that the dress is beautiful and perfect and that he has no idea what he is talking about."
8827,I thank him for bringing us all together like this.
8828,Hi sis.
8829,"I just commented, but I’m going to say it again."
8830,You look like Cinderella in that dress.
8831,You will see so many different kinds of dresses.
8832,"There will be black, red, white, purple, pink etc."
8833,"two piece, mermaid, tight, poofy dresses and everything in between."
8834,"Go there look stunning take lots of photos & videos, dance your heart out with your friends."
8835,"Last piece of advice, don’t delete those photos you take for any reason because while you may not like some now you’ll look back at the goofy photos and remember the fun time you had."
8836,Too extravagant for prom?
8837,Hahahahaha.
8838,He obviously has no fucking clue what he is talking about.
8839,"Is not what ""he"" had in mind?"
8840,Honey.
8841,This isn't about him.
8842,Who does this boy think he is?
8843,"Lol.... for real tho 

If you're worried about overdressing, here are my thoughts."
8844,"First off, it's prom."
8845,"If you're dressed up more than everyone else, I would honestly be surprised and think everyone else is underdressed."
8846,My little sister just went to prom dressed up in an equally as fancy dress and she fit right in.
8847,"Usually, less fancy and shorter dresses are for homecoming."
8848,"Second, even if you are overdressed, it's only awkward if you make it awkward."
8849,"Unless everyone is literally in jeans and t-shirts, you just appear more regal and elegant if you do it with confidence."
8850,Confidence is what makes something look fitting for an occasion.
8851,"I know that sounds like flowery mom-talk, but I'm telling you, it's actually and legitimately true-- I mean just look at the Met Gala lol."
8852,Confidence is like make-up.
8853,Makes everything you wear look amazing.
8854,You got this!!
8855,You look stunning and if I was at homecoming with you I would be wishing my dress looked like yours.
8856,"Not to put too fine a point on it, but... what *he* had in mind?"
8857,He isn't the one wearing it.
8858,You look perfect.
8859,"Well, his dress can be whatever he wants."
8860,Yours is this gorgeous getup.
8861,It's not what he had in mind?
8862,Your dress is beautiful.
8863,He's not the one wearing it so it doesn't matter whether or not he had it in mind.
8864,You look like a princess and I think it's a lovely choice.
8865,I certainly never regretted going all out to look like a princess at my prom.
8866,:)
8867,I guess I’m no one.
8868,"My dress for prom was similarly floofy and sparkly, but in peach."
8869,It was great.
8870,Roll with it.
8871,You look amazing!
8872,"You chose something that fits you perfectly, matches your skin tone well, and makes you happy."
8873,You got this!
8874,good thing it's not just his prom - it's yours too.
8875,"I am older, but not that old, and it seems exactly in line with what I think of when I hear ""prom dress""."
8876,It also fits you perfectly and the color is beautiful.
8877,You don't get to wear fancy floofy gowns much as an adult - Prom is the exact place for this dress.
8878,"You're your own person, it's your prom too, you can wear whatever you want."
8879,"Also I know that others  have said this, but he doesn't sound great if he talks to you like that."
8880,Yaaaay!
8881,"Communication is key, I’m glad he came around."
8882,all of your friends in their generic dresses are gonna be so jealous!
8883,Opinions are like assholes.
8884,Most of the time men should keep it to themselves when it comes to women.
8885,Prom is the time to be extravagant.
8886,This dress is modern Cinderella and is a beautiful gown.
8887,Your boyfriend owes you an apology.
8888,Wear the dress.
8889,Lots of people have gone fancier & tackier…… maybe in your town this is considered “extra” but I assure you it’s not.
8890,"I’m in Orlando, FL and this would be tame for any of our school events."
8891,It’s lovely and I hope you don’t change a thing about it (besides adding a tiara!)
8892,Nobody has *ever* worn anything close to that?
8893,Are kids these days not dressing in formal wear for prom anymore?
8894,"Granted, it was before either of you were born, but when I went to prom all the girls wore gorgeous full dresses, though no where nearly as classy and elegant as this one."
8895,"One of my friends however wore a really hot, fitted and tailored pantsuit with a giant rhinestone choker and a gorgeous updo."
8896,"To my knowledge, nobody had ever worn anything like that either and she was the best dressed person in the room."
8897,I think it’s fantastic to stand out from the crowd at prom.
8898,You will probably have a lot of ladies jealous of your look!
8899,EVERYONE wore dresses like this to my prom.
8900,"If this helps, I work at a store that sells prom dresses and I’ve seen plenty that are like this!"
8901,Its not that unusual of a prom style from what I’ve seen
8902,Consider me an uncle.
8903,"Came across my prom photos not too long ago, and the biggest memory is how happy my girlfriend looked dolled up."
8904,"If you love the dress, and you should its an elegant fancy, that joy will shine through and he better see the beauty it radiates."
8905,Don’t let him make you second guess yourself.
8906,I’m the mother of four sons and I can’t imagine any of them ever feeling it was okay to make their girlfriends feel like this.
8907,Maybe you should really surprise him with something he wasn’t expecting and go without him.
8908,I thought the whole idea about prom was to find a beautiful dress that makes you stand out?
8909,Why on earth would you want to be part of the crowd?
8910,"It is elegant and modest, and I agree with previous posters, with some simple accessories you will be the belle of the ball!!"
8911,!
8912,That’s good enough for me!
8913,With some sparkling earrings and gorgeous hairstyle he will probably appreciate it more when you’re out for the evening.
8914,You only get to dress up like this maybe twice in your life and whatever makes you feel like a princess is beautiful.
8915,Ps I love the embroidery.
8916,It's awesome.
8917,Extravagant is the point of prom!
8918,"You’re totally rocking that dress, it looks great."
8919,Now go to prom looking like a rockstar and have some fun.
8920,"Hey look, everyone is jumping on your boyfriend but don't take it to heart since they weren't actually there."
8921,"If you asked his opinion, there should be nothing wrong with him giving you an honest one."
8922,* He didn't call you hideous.
8923,"* He didn't say you are not allowed to wear it

* He didn't try to force you to wear something *he* picked

Instead, he simply told you how he felt about THE DRESS."
8924,"He didn't even say it was ugly, just that it's not what he had expected for prom."
8925,The fact that he said you should still wear it because it's what *you* like shows that he understands it's not about him.
8926,He sounds like an OK guy to me just based on what you've said here.
8927,"Keep your eyes and ears open for any weirdness but, to be honest, if you don't like what he says to you or he makes you feel like shit in general, nothing is forcing you to stay with him."
8928,I think you asked for his opinion and he gave an honest answer.
8929,Idk why these comments are coming after your boyfriend so hard.
8930,I think it’s nice that he was honest and I’d appreciate that from my boyfriend.
8931,It’s just not your typical prom style dress.
8932,He even said he’d support if you still wanted to wear it so that’s good!
8933,"It’s a nice dress and it looks good on you, at the end of the day all that really matters is if YOU feel good in it."
8934,"If you don’t feel good and you can return it, see if he can help you pick a new one!"
8935,"If you feel pretty in it, then keep the dress and enjoy your prom feeling like a beautiful princess!"
8936,That’s what prom is all about and you deserve to feel good!
8937,I think many people are overreacting to your boyfriend's comments.
8938,"If you two have open communication and are honest with each other often, and if you asked his opinion on the dress, his truth is fair."
8939,"Now if hating how you dress or look is a common thing he does, that's a different story."
8940,"I'm late to the game, but as more the older sister or aunt figure, I thought it might be something like this."
8941,"I don't think you need to throw out the whole ass man over it, as long as he's not being a dick about it."
8942,"He had a different mental image of your dress before, which is fine."
8943,You found this incredible dress that you fell in love with.
8944,Wear the hell out of it and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the girls tell you how amazing it is.
8945,"Ok, he gets a cookie back."
8946,"It's not so much that he's being a jerk as he's wanting to fit in so, yeah, he gets a cookie back because that's how high school is."
8947,"That being said, all the people when I was in high school that would dress out of the norm but wear it in confidence we called trend setters."
8948,The best accessory to add to that is to wear it like a boss.
8949,You look beautiful!
8950,💜Mom
8951,No one wears formal wear to a formal these days?
8952,These things are cyclical.
8953,A few years ago someone showed up casual and it caught on.
8954,You show up in that dress and other kids will see you and get jealous.
8955,In a few years the whole place will be filled with formal attire.
8956,You can be the trend or you can follow it.
8957,Nothing wrong with either path.
8958,There's risk in being the trend but even if you swing and miss you'll have learned a new lesson.
8959,Following the trend will only teach you how to conform into what's comfortable.
8960,"I had a similar dress to my own prom, only it was purple."
8961,Maybe things have changed but people tended to wear a mix of floofly skirts and more sleek numbers.
8962,And I agree with that other person who says this is one of the few appropriate times you can wear a fancy dress so live while you can.
8963,“No one has ever worn anything like this”?
8964,Lmao.
8965,Let me send you a picture of my prom group from my senior year.
8966,Everyone but me had dresses like this.
8967,"My parents couldn’t afford one, so mine wasn’t."
8968,"I didn’t get to do it up like this again until my wedding, 14 years later."
8969,"If you love the dress, wear it."
8970,You look like a Disney princess.
8971,Never listen to a boy that thinks you are “too” anything.
8972,"You are perfectly you, it seems he is not the right fit."
8973,Why is he worried about what he had in mind for YOU to wear?!
8974,?
8975,"Completely off topic here, but what *did* he have in mind?"
8976,"And if he had a vision board on Pinterest, why didn't he share it with you?"
8977,Thats bc everyone else is basic- you look GORGEOUS
8978,Hm.
8979,Ok.
8980,Feeling better about the bf but still
8981,It's a beautiful and totally appropriate prom dress.
8982,"If I'd gone to prom, I would have worn one like it."
8983,"Girl, my prom dress was so big my date had to lean over it for our picture."
8984,It was more intricate than many wedding dresses I’ve seen.
8985,"I didn’t look out of place, I looked elegant."
8986,"A lot of standard prom dresses are somewhat costumey and try to give that full, dramatic look as cheaply as possible and it shows."
8987,"Your dress is regal, exquisite and the color is sublime."
8988,You will be a queen in a room full of princesses.
8989,"My school doesnt have a prom, but we do have like a simple party to celebrate us as seniors."
8990,"I have a friend that wore a dress like it was her wedding day😂 there were some voices that said it was too extravagant (especially teachers) but most of us were like ""well, as long as she's confident and feel pretty wearing that🤷🏽‍♀️""."
8991,"So if you like it and you want to, just wear it!"
8992,He's absolutely wrong.
8993,Girls/women wear dresses of this level of decoration to prom all the time.
8994,"Prom is a very fancy formal, and definitely the chance to pull out all the stops."
8995,"Literally googling ""prom dresses"" shows dozens of dresses that are very similar in their amount of decoration."
8996,"Sis, tell him his suit is bland and not what you had in mind for prom lol

Jokes aside, it is a really beautiful dress."
8997,Do you feel beautiful in the dress?
8998,My prom dress was in the same color and it’s one of my favorite dresses I’ve ever worn.
8999,"Girl, wear the dress."
9000,It looks amazing.
9001,My friends and I wore ball-gown esque dresses for our proms and I loved how I felt wearing it.
9002,For someone with major self confidence issues I felt beautiful for once.
9003,"Plus, if it covers your feet you can wear shoes that are more comfortable!"
9004,Sorry but guys really don’t have a say in what you should or shouldn’t wear to prom.
9005,He better come with it and ready to match!
9006,He’s gonna look like a scrub if he doesn’t find a sick tux+ accessories to keep up with you!
9007,Tell him conformity through fear is for the simpleminded.
9008,Who cares what people have done before?
9009,That was their choice.
9010,Now it’s YOUR turn.
9011,😊
9012,"I wore a sleek dress to my prom in the 2010s, but there were girls in dresses like this."
9013,"If money hadn't been an issue, I would have loved to have dressed like this."
9014,Prom is your opportunity to dress like a princess and his opportunity to cope with that.
9015,I’ve always said that you really only get to wear a fun fancy dress two times in your life average.
9016,"Prom, and your wedding!"
9017,"Go for it girl, it’s very pretty!"
9018,Tell him he can wear whatever dress he wants.
9019,"You will be the princess of the prom and if you are lucky, single too."
9020,"I'm not a mom, nor a dad."
9021,But everyone here is right about the boyfriend.
9022,But...
9023,"The dress is down in the back, suggesting it's too big."
9024,"Probably one of those ""between two sizes"" issue."
9025,I'll also add.
9026,"It's common for men to make something up when they know that there's an issue, but not know *why* there is an issue."
9027,Doesn't mean his not being a prick.
9028,The other possibility is that he wasn't planning on doing anything this fancy.
9029,"But screw all those people who say ""it's your day not his."""
9030,"Apparently a man isn't supposed to look forward to formal events, nor have an opinion about what the person they're going as."
9031,Sexist bullshit.
9032,"Okay, he's wrong about the dress."
9033,I accept that.
9034,It's a formal event and you should want to look good.
9035,But there's no need to slap him down for having an opinion.
9036,Ha!
9037,If he thinks that's an excessive dress.
9038,Maybe give him pics of other dresses.
9039,Show him how bad it could be.
9040,He's got it good.
9041,A dress shouldn't change a damn thing.
9042,He should walk though shit for you.
9043,>He said he thinks it’s too extravagant and it’s not what he had in mind for prom.
9044,No one has ever worn anything close to this so it makes sense.
9045,He said he likes the dress in general and if I want to I should wear it.
9046,"it doesn't matter if its not what he had in mind, its your body you can dress it however you want."
9047,"also if no one has worn a dress like this to your schools proms before, than darling, make a statement with this dress."
9048,"imagine for a second, you float into prom looking like a princess, all eyes are on you because everyone cant believe how such a beautiful person has turned up to prom, the lights hit anything sparkly you may be wearing, tonight you are the most spectacular, most beautiful, most interesting person in the world."
9049,"Dad here,  sounds like he is grumpy you aren't wearing something more ""sexy""."
9050,If that is the case it is too bad so sad for him because you look gorgeous in your dress and you should be happy to rock it at prom.
9051,"It doesn’t sound like he hates it but is concerned that you may look too dressed up and is just trying to protect you, I think the dress is fine."
9052,One girl wore a duct tape dress to prom in my high school and no one cared.
9053,"Sweetie, there are loads of prom dresses that are “extravagant”."
9054,You look amazing in that dress!
9055,I bet there will be plenty of other dresses that your boyfriend would consider as extravagant.
9056,And there will be dresses that are considered simple.
9057,It’s prom.
9058,There’s supposed to be a variety of styles of dresses.
9059,"Otherwise, every girl would be wearing the same or similar dress and that’d be boring."
9060,Wear that amazing dress with pride.
9061,<3
9062,I don't know what he's talking about.
9063,At my prom we had tons of dresses as fancy as yours.
9064,I don't think you would stand out as unusual in that regard.
9065,And I think you look great in it!
9066,"It has a very Cinderella vibe, in a lovely way."
9067,"I think you should tell him that if being extra fancy embarases him, he can go alone."
9068,Otherwise he needs to get on board with it and find a matching tie.
9069,You do not need to spend money on a second dress.
9070,"Younger mom here, prom 5 years ago."
9071,There was a girl with a full quince dress at prom.
9072,And others who were wearing hoop skirts.
9073,It’s whatever you feel beautiful in.
9074,Everyone has different styles.
9075,"I for one, and everyone else here, think you look amazing and picked a beautiful dress."
9076,It fits nicely and the color is beautiful on you.
9077,You wear that to prom and either A) find a different date that won’t put you down.
9078,Or B) tell boyfriend to shut his piehole if he wants to still go together.
9079,Life is to short to spend it on people that don’t lift you up.
9080,"Frankly, he's probably nervous because he doesn't want to dress up to compliment it."
9081,"He was planning on his ""nice"" jeans and a button up shirt."
9082,It’s a stunning fairy Princess dress and I say wear it and waft into that prom with pride!
9083,It may not be your boyfriends’ thing but that’s okay - everyone has different tastes.
9084,Hopefully he share his opinion respectfully!
9085,Either way the dress is bought and all us moms love it - go enjoy yourself!
9086,Bet you get lots of compliments ^__^
9087,Boyfriend here and when my gf asks for my opinion I'm always 100% honest so that when i say i love something on her she knows im genuine.
9088,How much his opinion matters is up to you.
9089,These moms telling you to replace him with no context are insane.
9090,Rock that shit girl and have fun!
9091,Prom is dumb as fuck place to have drama.
9092,Like someone else said.
9093,You only have a very few events where you can wear a dress like this and prom is one of them so do it.
9094,Wear are the dress you like and wear the dress you’ve dreamed of.
9095,Boys come and go but pictures and memories are forever.
9096,"😂
And you will have so much more fun feeling confident and comfortable so don’t let anyone mess with that."
9097,❤️
9098,This is your aunt.
9099,You do not listen to that boy and you find yourself a boy who will hype you up and tell you how amazing you look in that dress.
9100,"My prom dress was a big, poofy, “extravagant” dress."
9101,Your uncle bought it for me because he said every girl deserves a pretty prom dress.
9102,Mine looks very similar to yours but mine had enough glitter on it that I’m still finding it 16 years later!
9103,And you know what?
9104,I felt and looked like a princess in that dress.
9105,Glitter and all.
9106,And you look so much more like a queen in your dress.
9107,Regal and made for you.
9108,Walk tall and proud.
9109,"Now, let’s talk hair and makeup."
9110,What are you thinking?
9111,"I’m feeling a half up, half down with a tiara so there’s no question who the royalty is in the room."
9112,"Girl, my prom dress was soooooo extra, so do you!"
9113,I had a dang petticoat and ruffles and everything.
9114,Lol so he said he likes the dress in general…but then in your title you say he hates it…and now everyone is just shitting on him unnecessarily for telling u the truth which I assumed u asked him for??
9115,?
9116,Not what he had in mind?
9117,He can wear a different dress then can't he.
9118,You have to know yourself.
9119,"As long as you won’t feel bad if you show up to prom and 75% of the girls are wearing skimpy cocktail dresses instead of floor length ball gowns, wear whatever you want."
9120,I wish I could say that I wouldn’t have been uncomfortable at that age but I had a lot of growing up to do.
9121,"Image search ""prom dress"" on Google and you won't even have to scroll to see what literally looks like your dress."
9122,I don't think there's anything more telling than that.
9123,You're SUPPOSED to be dressy and classy to prom.
9124,"If not prom, then when?"
9125,Adults dont really dress up like that sadly.
9126,"He's probably worried because of one of two things: You're going to outdress him, which means he actually has to put in effort for his own outfit to be able to stand next to your beauty."
9127,"Or two, He's worried you're too beautiful and you'll catch other guys's gazes."
9128,"Both of those are ""him"" issues that you don't need to worry about."
9129,His immaturity is showing and you can ignore it and him.
9130,You are beautiful.
9131,The color is gorgeous and complements you well.
9132,The details are eye catching without being overwhelming.
9133,"It's a very nicely balance, giving a sense of elegance."
9134,I am a professional photographer.
9135,"My job for the last decade is to make people look good and capture that moment, so trust me when I say, you look good."
9136,(The best accessory would be to change the boy out for pearls and white gloves. )
9137,"When you are at prom, remember: shoulders back, chest up, and keep the chin down."
9138,"people have a bad habit of rasing their chin to seem more confident, but it just makes them look arrogant."
9139,(And you dont want people looking up your nose.)
9140,Confidence is in the shoulders and back.
9141,"Remember, confidence is sexy."
9142,Be proud of yourself and trust that you are lovely.
9143,Don't hang around those who try to tear down your confidence.
9144,You don't need them.
9145,Hugs!
9146,-Mom
9147,I’m neither a mom nor a dad but I am a guy and I think the dress looks fantastic.
9148,You’re both young so keep in mind he might also have some hang ups related to what he considers extravagant because of his own personal experiences that he’s unfairly projecting onto you.
9149,I grew up upper middle class in a very poor area so I definitely harbored some shame as a kid if I felt like my dad was flaunting wealth.
9150,Don’t feel bad at all about the dress and you definitely should be proud of it.
9151,Random uncle who got recommended this post even though I’m not subscribed to the sub: I think it’s classy.
9152,"Most of the girls at my prom wore strapless dresses covered in glitter and sequins that went from the top of their chest to the bottom of their butt, not that I’m shaming them, but I think your dress looks lovely and will be taken as unique in a good way in contrast to what most people wear to prom."
9153,I feel like you look like a queen!
9154,I think prom is one of the few times you get to really bust-a-move with the fanciness.
9155,Maybe he's struggling to afford his tux?
9156,He might not know how to match this level of fancy.
9157,(I'm married to a really big guy and sometimes men's formal wear can suddenly be pretty expensive.)
9158,Checking in a few months later…what did you decide?
9159,How are you feeling about it?
9160,Does he just not want to rent a tux and is turning this around and making it a you problem?
9161,"The dress is beautiful, it fits well, it's modest."
9162,So not sure what the problem is...
9163,What you wear to prom isn’t his decision.
9164,Also dump him
9165,You should wear it and feel as beautiful as you look.
9166,"He must have been hoping for:

9167,"Someday someone is going to tell him that that never asked him for his opinion, and that they don't care what he thinks."
9168,And he's gonna be *shocked*.
9169,The audacity of this boy.
9170,"Your dress looks gorgeous, I hope you feel beautiful in it and have a blast at prom!"
9171,too extravagant??
9172,No one has ever worn anything close to this???
9173,"im sorry as a gal who went to 5 different proms from 4 different schools, and one of those proms even being a more low key/relaxed “GED” prom.....every girl wore something *extremely* similar to this...but everyone has a different style."
9174,you’ll see plenty of different colors in a variety of styles.
9175,"poofy, sleek, mermaid, etc etc."
9176,i would say this is *very* appropriate for PROM.
9177,it’s one of the few times in life you get to dress up like this and have fun!
9178,you look bangin girl!
9179,!
9180,"Since you've already bought it, his only intention in saying anything negative at this point is to bring you down and make you question yourself."
9181,This is manipulative and rude.
9182,"You live your best life, girl and say bye-bye to the dude, not the dress."
9183,Another sis here OP - telling you from experience that this is an important conversation to have with yourself.
9184,A boyfriend who degrades your appearance doesn’t really love you.
9185,And you deserve to be loved.
9186,ESPECIALLY in that total banger of a dress.
9187,Big brother coming in with a bear hug!
9188,":-) u/fluffybabycow, your dress is S.T.U.N.N.I.N.G."
9189,and you look amazing!
9190,"Your boyfriend on the other hand, is not amazing."
9191,Anyone who puts you down or degrades you is someone to move on or walk away from.
9192,"Also, you've mentioned elsewhere on this thread that he has said: ""it's not what \[he\] had in mind""."
9193,"Sis, this is the start of controlling and abusive behaviour; he is trying to control what you wear and - by extension - what you do."
9194,You can do soooo much better than this!
9195,Kick his arse to the kerb ASAP.
9196,"Plus, he isn't wearing the dress."
9197,**You're wearing it...and you look fabulous!!!
9198,HUGS!!!
9199,"**

Go and shine - yeet the boyfriend - enjoy your prom sis!"
9200,No he doesn’t control what I wear.
9201,This is actually the first time he’s reacted this way so I was surprised .
9202,Thank you for the care :)
9203,On the other hand.
9204,"If she has been asking how it looks and he genuinely doesn't like it, do you think it's better for him to do the stereotypical defeated husband ""looks lovely dear"" and fake liking it?"
9205,"If he's being rude about it, like saying ""that dress is so ugly"" etc without being asked about it first, that's a different matter."
9206,"But if he's asked, him telling the truth is only what should be expected imo, and OP did not specify how he was acting, only what his opinion is."
9207,These comments are insane
9208,Yeah I'm getting strong Cinderella vibes
9209,> Gives of “I’m a princess in a fairytale” vibes.
9210,Exactly.
9211,I know Millenial Disney kids (turned adults) who love this.
9212,Gen Z would collectively barf.
9213,I think this is seriously a good idea.
9214,You do not HAVE to go with him— you can change your mind now that you have better info (that he’s not dating material).
9215,If you allow him to go with you and he says **anything** unkind please say to him “this date is now concluded.” And hang with your buds instead.
9216,"No fight, no bad vibes, just done."
9217,I went stag to senior prom and spent the entire night dancing with my girl friends and eating fruit at the chocolate fountain.
9218,"I dont remember what anyone was wearing besides myself, it was semi dark, loud af and I was too busy having a blast."
9219,I second your opinion of ditching the boy toy and going with a friend or even a group.
9220,"Yes, keep the dress!"
9221,Exchange the boyfriend.
9222,[deleted]
9223,How is she gonna have a good time now that this entire sub is trying to convince her that her date is some kind of abusive monster?
9224,Like we dont know the guy.
9225,Could be on the spectrum and responded with blunt honesty without thinking.
9226,THIS!!!
9227,You look wonderful.
9228,He has his preferences but so do you.
9229,Wear what makes you feel confident and beautiful :)
9230,There has to be a better guy out there than this little chucklehead
9231,"Yes, sometimes you just need to throw the whole man out and start over."
9232,Her: Do you like the dress?
9233,Him: No really honey.
9234,Reddit: OMG fuck HIMMMMMM.
9235,Break up immediately.
9236,"Yes, I am assuming this conversation was this way in this comment, and you are assuming it didn't in yours, both are made up assumptions."
9237,Sure.
9238,You would never want a boyfriend that gave an honest opinion.
9239,"Your boyfriend needs to have someone teach him that (with few exceptions, like if you'll literally get thrown out of the venue for wearing it) the only answer to ""how does this dress I love look on me?"""
9240,"is ""absolutely amazing""."
9241,"This isn't a time when we really want their opinions, it's a time when we want our own opinions in a lower voice"
9242,> He’s probably insecure with himself as all men are.
9243,so hekn holesum
9244,I suspect he just watches a lot of television: a sea of girls in satin bathtowel sheaths.
9245,"Now your dress is incredible; the really unique detailing of the neckline, the smooth gradation of the beadwork."
9246,You have exquisite taste.
9247,My hair is dark brown and curly so I’ll JSUT be wearing my natural curls that night :) but thank tou for this.
9248,This comment really caught my attention and I just had to comment on this.
9249,I’m not from the us so prom isn’t that common or big of a thing - we don’t do corsages but I feel like he’s gonna get me a flower so let’s wait and see :) thank you for thsi comment tho
9250,Other dad agrees with this dad.
9251,Maybe she asked?
9252,"I shut my mouth about this things and act as if I like everything if my wife likes it and is already bough, but almost all the instances is my wife is the one asking, and at least the 3rd time she asks I tell her the truth."
9253,You dropped this /s.
9254,"In case you didn’t why isn’t he allowed to have is opinion on something, like it honestly doesn’t like a very good dress"
9255,You don't sound like a very tolerant human.
9256,Why would you judge someone based on a subjective opinion on a piece of cloth?
9257,she will in this dress!
9258,:)
9259,I want to meet your wife now :)
9260,Love the bippity boppity part
9261,6 year olds give the best advice
9262,Thank you for your opinion.
9263,he was never gonna force me to not wear ur.
9264,I was worried that it was a genuinely ugly dress and that maybe I was overreacting
9265,"For real, I thought I was taking crazy pills"
9266,I love reasonable people.
9267,I’m an actual mom and you should wear what you want.
9268,But I understand that high school is a time where you are trying to figure yourself out and opinions of others matter more than they should.
9269,Your boyfriend has every right to have an opinion.
9270,He should learn how to sensor himself.
9271,How long have you guys been together?
9272,He’s not a horrible person for saying one jerky thing.
9273,"If you had said he has a history of this, that’s different."
9274,Thank you!
9275,I was also concerned by the other comments.
9276,"Seriously it’s wild lol

Obviously we all hope people will be tactful with us but do all these people really want their boyfriends to be patronizing yes-men?"
9277,"Further, (and again if she loves this dress by all means wear it) he might be thinking about how she will feel if she gets to the prom and looks way out of place."
9278,"I know I’ve had events where I thought I was gunna look great and then you show up over/underdressed and feel self conscious all night

If you’re ready to cut ties with someone because they don’t care for an article of clothing you’re going to wear for one night you need to grow up a little bit lol"
9279,"For real, and the dress is not even that nice lol"
9280,This is my favourite comment till now.
9281,I was searching for this one.
9282,Thank you for this.
9283,I ended up talking to him about it because it’s both our proms and we decided to alter the dress in certain areas so both of us like what I’m wearing.
9284,As supportive as this community is I was never gonna dump him over it and I knew he was allowed to have his own opinion I just didn’t know if I genuinely made a bad choice in dress or not.

9287,As someone who has been in a healthy relationship for 18 years….
9288,you’re exactly right.
9289,My wife and I actually value each other’s opinion and I think it would be unhealthy to dismiss it outright.
9290,I’d want to know if I was wearing something she hated.

9309,"Seriously, part of a healthy relationship is open communication."
9310,"My long-term SO has worn clothes I hate and vise-versa, we both tell each other."
9311,"Doesn't mean we ourselves do not wear said clothes, but it's a nice thing to keep in the back of your mind when you're going out with them or something."
9312,These harsh character judgements towards the boyfriend reflect people that have never had a healthy relationship.
9313,"As someone that is not a fan of frilly/gaudy stuff I 100% understand why he doesn't like it, but poor/harsh communication is standard for a 17-18 year old guy."
9314,I think this is the most spot on comment.
9315,"However, I don’t try ink the boyfriend should have voiced his opinion in this situation unless he was pressed for his honest opinion."

9404,I was just coming here to say that.
9405,Her dress is so classy.
9406,A lot of people look back at their prom pictures and cringe.

9432,"If he was a dick about it, then he’s a dick."
9433,"But asking an opinion, not liking it, then going somewhere where hundreds, if not thousands, of people will only serve as an ego boost is childish and wrong and will only make OP resent and hate the guy even more."
9434,Tell him he can wear a simple dress himself if that's what he wants lol.
9435,Too much for prom?
9436,"Oh dear, prom is the perfect time to wear a floofy princess dress."
9437,It's a lovely dress and the color is perfect on you.
9438,I think it's a great prom dress and I wouldn't hesitate to wear it to a formal event.
9439,How did you feel about it when you first tried it on and decided to buy it?
9440,"Honey, the ONLY thing that would be too much for prom is a wedding gown."
9441,The whole point is to be fancy and feel beautiful!
9442,"As for the colour, he really should have said something before you bought it if he cared so much."
9443,"Now, it's too late and it's not your problem."
9444,"It's your dress, the only thing that really matters is whether *you* like it."
9445,It is both formal and elegant.
9446,Clearly his good taste ended at choosing you.
9447,"Personal opinion: if 5yo girls aren't asking you if you're a princess, you chose the wrong prom dress!"
9448,It looks beautiful and it fits you really well.
9449,Don't let his negativity talk you out of something you love.

9461,You look beautiful.
9462,He can kick rocks.
9463,it's formal and elegant though.
9464,maybe your boyfriend is just a twat lol
9465,Homeboy must be blind.
9466,That’s a perfect dress and you look stunning in it.
9467,He’s ridiculous and I don’t think I like him tbh
9468,The color is my favorite part.
9469,It goes well with your skintone!
9470,Wear some silver make up and pop!
9471,It’s formal and elegant.
9472,Put a tiara on and you’re on a princess.

9476,The whole point of prom is the opportunity to do too much.
9477,":) It’s beautiful, it fits you very nicely, and you love it."
9478,Tell him to deal with it and wear it!
9479,"See, what I'm hearing here is ""he was expecting something slinky and clingy in bold satin."""
9480,"When clothes don't fit the body type or fashion style of the wearer, they are not attractive."
9481,"Let that boy know you aren't a floor model red corvette, you're a silver gray Mercedes-AMG GT coupe."
9482,"(if you or he thinks that sounds like a bad deal, maybe look up both cars and think again)"
9483,Prom is the only time you’ll EVER need a dress like this!!
9484,(Unless u r in a very fancy wedding or in your own wedding but I don’t wanna get married ) BUT ANYWAYS I think it’s great and he should like it because you do and I have a boyfriend that says opinions like that too and they get on my nerves but ya know what you only have one life and a prom dress is not even worth making comments over and he needs to learn that.
9485,Also you only have one life and if nobody likes the dress besides you you should still wear it imo bc it’s your dang body!
9486,You dang prom!!
9487,Everyone else can worry about their own damn selves!!!!!!
9488,!
9489,Nonsense!
9490,"I've seen people wearing hot pink with rhinestones with big ol' cutouts and that's not considered ""too much."""
9491,"It's a lovely color, very flattering, and you will look amazing in it!"
9492,"I think it's beautiful as others have said, but if you're worried about it being ""too much"", counteract some of the formality with some silver hoop earrings and a simple hairdo (perhaps pulled back in a low ponytail)?"
9493,-- I think that would balance any concerns nicely.
9494,"You'll look gorgeous, be confident!!"
9495,!
9496,naaa that’s not too much for prom!
9497,"I was going to get a dress that had similar embroidery for my prom but it got canceled cause I was a senior in 2020. you look beautiful in it, and if you like it that’s all that should matter."
9498,I kept my prom dress for years (and it looked a lot like this!).
9499,I didn't even keep the boyfriend until September.
9500,"Odds are you won’t marry this boy, my love."
9501,Wear the dress and wear it knowing you look absolutely stunning.
9502,It's your prom too.
9503,He can have his opinion but if he doesn't like it or want you to wear it to prom then he can find another date.
9504,Brother here with some likely not wanted male perspective…I think he wants you to wear something shorter and tighter…he’s probably just being a perv and looking at the event in the wrong way.
9505,That dress is really pretty and looks great on you.
9506,"Don’t assume it’s just a color issue, ask him point blank what’s wrong with it and what would he rather you wear."
9507,"If the answer is shorter and tighter, you should go to prom with your friends instead :P also I’ll beat him up for being a perv if you want"
9508,Keep the dress and get a new boyfriend.
9509,The dress is beautiful.
9510,OP I don't think he's being mean to you.
9511,"That doesn't look like a prom dress, it's too formal and reserved"
9512,In what way is a gown not formal or elegant?
9513,"I’ll be honest, I think he doesn’t know what those words mean."
9514,"Too much😱

There is no ""too much"" for prom."
9515,The dress is beautiful on you and the color is awesome with your skintone!❤💐💅👄👗👠👑💥
9516,I mean idk what the kids are dancing to these days but-My prom is a whole mess of teenagers grinding on each other in formalwear after pregaming in a rented limo.
9517,It’s cosplaying formalwear without the weird stuffy vibes of having to impress anyone.
9518,Have fun!!
9519,"Wear fairy wings if you want, go nuts."
9520,If you feel beautiful then that’s all that matters.
9521,He’s wrong.
9522,I’m sorry he made you question the dress you obviously loved at one point.
9523,It looks really beautiful on you.
9524,"It fits beautifully, is elegant, classy, and definitely formal."
9525,I don’t feel like most teen boys are fashion experts.
9526,Most of them are wearing cargo shorts and socks with sandals.
9527,Untrustworthy with advice on these matters.
9528,😂
9529,nahhh you get to go all out for prom.
9530,white is literally the only color I would question.
9531,It's beautiful.
9532,"This is just one aspect of your relationship, out of many, so it's hard to judge him based off this."
9533,But I would set some boundaries here.
9534,It matters way more that you like your clothes - he doesn't have to approve.
9535,"If this dress makes you smile that is the only thing that matters, he should keep his opinion to himself."
9536,A good relationship makes you feel happier and more confident.
9537,"Don't let a guy talk down to you or make you feel insecure, you deserve way more than that."
9538,You chose the wrong boyfriend.
9539,Girl I had a full on Cinderella blue ball gown complete with beaded silver lace appliqués all over my prom dress and have never regretted a second.
9540,"If you like it, screw your boyfriend, he’s being an uptight jerk."
9541,"There are only so many times you get to dress up like this when you’re a teen and adult, enjoy it!"
9542,"I'm not saying dump him, but I am going to say make sure you take pictures alone and with friends (without him in them!)."
9543,It's a beautiful dress.
9544,"Lmao, sorry."
9545,I wore a bright pink n and white tux with a cane n tophat.. lol too much 😆
9546,I think it’s very formal and elegant.
9547,Is it the latest style?
9548,Probably not.
9549,But tastes and trends change.
9550,You wear what makes you feel pretty.
9551,It’s a lovely dress.
9552,Tell him to grow up.
9553,My homecoming dress was the fanciest dress I've ever worn.
9554,"Fuck it, you look beautiful and it complements your figure so well."
9555,"The embroidery is lovely, but that off shoulder sleeve is absolutely my favorite part"
9556,No offense but I'll get downed for this he's thinking hot n skimpy with high heels.
9557,Is there such a thing as too much for prom though?
9558,"The color is beautiful, and the dress looks amazing on you."
9559,"It looks a lot like a dress I wore to prom more than 20 years ago, except it was purple."
9560,"My boyfriend at the time (who is now my husband) would probably have told me I looked great even if I wore a potato sack, though

Just some food for thought"
9561,He's wrong on both counts.
9562,It can be formal and is definitely elegant.
9563,Your dress is quite stunning!
9564,I've seen a lot of kids taking prom photos last year.
9565,"From what I saw, the girls put in a lot more effort into their outfit than the boys did."
9566,I saw only a handful of boys wear formal clothing.
9567,I have seen dresses way more extreme than that at dances that aren't even prom.
9568,You look beautiful and if he can't see thay and only wants to tear you down it's time to reconsider his role in your life!
9569,Dump the dude; keep the dress.
9570,There is nothing whatsoever wrong with this clothing.
9571,There is a LOT wrong with your date.
9572,"This really shocking me culturally.. in my country most people have princess style dresses for prom, some not but that doesn't matter because both groups are rocking the dresses they want to wear for their prom."
9573,Enjoy the prom with your full heart because you and the dress are looking absolutely gorgeous and your boyfriend should respect that.
9574,It's so formal and so elegant!
9575,It's not minimalist or slinky in the satin-y way that's popular on Tik Tok at the moment but it's definitely suitable for a prom.
9576,Its prom for gaia's sake!
9577,Theres no such thing as too much.
9578,Its a one in a lifetime event made to make the girl feel truly special.
9579,"For some girls its the only chance they ever get to live out the fantasy of either pretty princess, elegant debutant, or sophisticated slut."
9580,Its the perfect time to go all out and have that dream dress.
9581,"""Too much"" pfft sound like hes ""too much"" smh"
9582,This is a gorgeous dress and fits you beautifully 😍 It reminds me of my mother's wedding dress!!!
9583,It's the same color 💙
9584,It's GORGEOUS.
9585,There is no such thing as 'too much'.
9586,"If someone ever calls you too much, what they are really saying is that they are not enough for you."
9587,I'm wondering if your boyfriend is concerned about the amount of attention you'll get looking so beautiful and this is coming from a place of jealousy over other guys noticing you.
9588,That's the only explanation I can think of that makes sense to me.
9589,"Either way, wear the dress and enjoy looking amazing."
9590,"Where else are you going to be able to wear a princess dress, if not to prom?"
9591,"It's a beautiful dress, it looks beautiful on you, your boyfriend is trippin'!"
9592,Too much?
9593,It is perfect.
9594,This dress is the exact definition of a prom dress.
9595,Don't let his insecurities ruin the good time.
9596,"I'm not a woman, just a dude browsing all... you need a better boyfriend"
9597,He's being an idiot.
9598,"It's your dress, not his."
9599,If he wants to wear a simple dress himself he can.
9600,People have gone to prom in full ballgowns less than 5 years ago.
9601,Prom is mostly a formal event.
9602,"In fact, at mine a few guys got turned away and told they couldn't go in because they had jeans on."
9603,It looks beautiful and so do you in it.
9604,I think he needs to take his head outta his ass and stop being jealous about how good you look.
9605,"Just butting in with my perspective, have worked within fashion in my time as well."
9606,The colour of the dress is a bit off putting it sort of comes across as grey and a bit lifeless personally the colour reminds me of mold.
9607,With that being said just go out and have fun.
9608,That's insane.
9609,Prom isn't for fuddy duddies.
9610,You guys are young.
9611,I don't think the dress is over the top at all.
9612,"But even if it was, I'd still say wear it."
9613,You're only young once.
9614,"You should do things, and wear things you enjoy."
9615,Even when you're old.
9616,Life is too short for boring.
9617,"It's a beautiful dress, perfect for a prom."
9618,"But, if for example, it wasn't suitable, your bf is still out of line for saying that."
9619,"He wasn't very kind to you, I hope this is an anomaly."
9620,"Have fun kitten, you're gonna look gorgeous!"
9621,I think the color looks absolutely lovely on you.
9622,I agree with everyone else that if he didn't help pay for it or help pick it out then he has absolutely zero say in the dress you wear.
9623,*You* are the one wearing it so it matters only that you like it.
9624,"And there's really no such thing as ""too much"" - that is an outdated and sexist societal notion."
9625,You wear that dress when you feel like it.
9626,My wedding dress is a glittery (literally) silver evening gown and I have worn it to costume parties and even the grocery store.
9627,Wear what makes you comfortable and happy and enjoy your prom.
9628,That's all that matters.
9629,I think the color is lovely.
9630,It flatters your skin tone.
9631,God forbid your prom dress looks like a prom dress
9632,I didn't go floofy enough for prom and regretted it.
9633,Pair it with a nice dark shawl or something and the wedding vibes will reduce.
9634,"Dude, I went to prom in a jacket made of white sequins."
9635,"To this day, I wish I went further, and got a black sequin hat to go with it."
9636,"Tell him HE should go further, so he can match you."
9637,"A blue and white organic design on a jacket, with some nice blue pants, and a white belt could look dope as hell."
9638,"It’s prom, it’s the time you should be feeling elegant and “too much.” They only people who believe in there being such a thing ass too much, don’t know how to make themselves shine without dimming everyone else around them"
9639,"Cool, now tell him if he wants something else you’d be happy to add a second look for prom night at his expense."
9640,Change halfway through.
9641,This is exactly the type of dress I think of when I think prom dress.
9642,He's wrong.
9643,"Also even if you wanted to wear something off the wall to prom, he's your boyfriend, he's supposed to have your back."
9644,The dress looks great and he needs to be more supportive
9645,No this is certainly not too much for a prom!
9646,It
9647,It is not too much for a prom.
9648,It’s gorgeous and you should wear the dress you want.
9649,It’s not up to him.
9650,"And also, he’s a jerk for raining on your happy."
9651,"Back in the 2000's, when I went to high school, the common style was empire waist, slinky dresses with cut outs."
9652,I went to prom in a huge black and red ball gown my mom made using a historic costume pattern.
9653,"I had so many compliments, and I still love that I was ME that day."
9654,Prom is a moment to live your best life.
9655,"Your dress is well fitted, looks amazing, and exactly what my brain pictures when I think ""Prom""."
9656,I broke up with my boyfriend before prom.
9657,"He still invited me to go as part of his ""harem"" 🙄

I went to prom with my gay best friend, and he and I had the best time."
9658,"I feel like the dress is the definition of a prom dress, I think this is the perfect occasion for it!"
9659,This is one of the few occasions you may get in your life to wear a dress like that so I'd go for it
9660,Pfffffffft.
9661,It is very elegant and perfect for prom.
9662,It's a classically beautiful dress.
9663,Tell him to fuck off.
9664,Looks great.
9665,"Seamstress here, it is both formal and elegant."
9666,What’s too much or too little is subjective.
9667,It is both formal and elegant.
9668,That's a beautiful dress!!
9669,And looks lovely on you :) Hope you rock it!
9670,This dress is the definition of formal and elegant!
9671,What he actually means is that there's not enough tits and ass showing.
9672,My son is going to prom this year and the girls have been sharing their dresses online.
9673,They run from short and simple or sleek and elegant to fairy princess and full-on ball gowns.
9674,"Your dress isn't ""too much"" at all, it is lovely and timeless."
9675,Too much for prom!
9676,?
9677,Too much for prom?
9678,Like… has he ever seen a prom before?
9679,Your dress is perfect and I would have totally worn it myself when I was in high school!
9680,"Sweetheart, I wore a FULL ballroom gown to prom."
9681,"Like, needed extra room in a seat, ballroom gown."
9682,You wear what YOU want to wear and what YOU like.
9683,Any man worth his salt will see your pride and self esteem and that is what makes you beautiful and attractive.
9684,Any dude who thinks you don’t look good just cause a dress is “too fancy” or “the wrong color” can kick bricks cause he’s obviously not on your level.
9685,This dress is beautiful and you look amazing in it.
9686,"Keep the dress, ditch the boyfriend."
9687,"‘Too much for prom’

Girl I graduated in 2006 at the highlight of cupcake dresses, I can assure you this is not too much."
9688,I’m commenting again because I just kinda looked through your history because something about your post just bothers me.
9689,"Sweetheart, first off, YOU ARE WORTHY, YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH, YOU ARE SPECIAL."
9690,"Now, I see you’re having problems with dad."
9691,"Man dads are…dads are tough, aren’t they?"
9692,And when they aren’t too good at being a dad to begin with it can get worse once they are doing it alone.
9693,"I’m sorry that’s happening to you, you don’t deserve his terrible words and demeaning down talking."
9694,I’m sorry you are feeling so lost and alone.
9695,I’m sorry you are feeling like you shouldn’t be here.
9696,But you should be here.
9697,You are smart and funny and kind and loving.
9698,"You care what others think and you worry if you are doing enough for them, that tells me you are a good person."
9699,I’m sorry Your mom wasn’t kinder to you and I’m sorry she said horrible things to you and I’m extremely sorry that you’re going this alone.
9700,Please hold on.
9701,Please.
9702,"Find a hotline, reach out to a friend, confide in a teacher."
9703,"But please, don’t give up."
9704,You.
9705,Are.
9706,Worthy.
9707,Your boyfriend shouldn’t be your boyfriend.
9708,"He should be building you help, not helping to break you down."
9709,"My dear sweet girl, I once had a high school boyfriend much like yours."
9710,Made everything seem like it was my fault.
9711,I was being stupid.
9712,I was being paranoid.
9713,I wasnt trying hard enough.
9714,I was creating drama.
9715,He would criticize what I wore if it made me look nice.
9716,He didn’t want others looking at me.
9717,He told me he was the only man who would put up with me and I started believing him.
9718,I married him.
9719,He abused me every chance he got.
9720,I’m telling you this because I want different for you.
9721,"I want you to see how amazing you are, despite the haters and the naysayers."
9722,"I think deep down, you still know you’re awesome."
9723,Look at that dress!
9724,YOU picked that gorgeous dress!
9725,And look how freaking amazing it looks on you?!
9726,You need a tiara because you look like a princess.
9727,And you know what?
9728,You deserve to look like a princess.
9729,"And more than that, you deserve to be treated like the badass woman that you are."
9730,"Soon this will pass, the anger and the harshness."
9731,Soon the vile words will be gone and you will be able to start out on your own.
9732,"And no matter how hard that seems, you’ve made it this far, which means you can make it even farther."
9733,YOU WILL DO GREAT THINGS.
9734,I can feel it.
9735,Please don’t give up on yourself.
9736,"Never, ever, EVER, let ANY man make you give up on yourself, not even your father."
9737,This is too much for prom?
9738,"Girl, you rock that shit to prom with or without him and you go have a blast!"
9739,"Someone else mentioned not having many opportunities to get dolled up, and I agree!"
9740,"So take this chance, look your best, and go dance your ass off!"
9741,Is there any chance that he is saying this because he can’t afford to spend as much dressing up and is worried about not looking as good as you or not matching as a couple?
9742,"That dress is lovely, and more important looks like you can also dance in it."
9743,"My prom dress was almost exactly that same color, just a touch greener."
9744,I loved it so much.
9745,"And now, 20 years later, I look at pictures of myself in it and still love it."
9746,Everyone telling you it’s timeless is absolutely correct.
9747,When I went to my prom I was upset because my boyfriend wore a tux but wore chuck taylors.
9748,I was pretty offended because I thought he was ruining the night by being too casual.
9749,Sort of the opposite of your problem.
9750,But you know what?
9751,At the end of the night I realized we had fun and we got to go together so what I thought of his shoes was really not important.
9752,"If the time spent with you means a lot to your boyfriend, what he thinks of your dress shouldn’t matter to him."
9753,Btw your dress is beautiful :)
9754,Prom is a REASON to be extra.
9755,Its supposed to be a big thing.
9756,Be as fancy as you want.
9757,You WILL regret not doing so later if you dont.
9758,"Due to personal reasons, i did not enjoy mine, and i wish i could go back and do it again."
9759,Id have done so many things differently.
9760,"Formal events to dress up and fancy up are rare, and you should treasure the extraness."
9761,"I mean, I can see preferring more classical colors like a black, white or maybe red."
9762,But there's nothing wrong with that dress.
9763,It's cute and completely appropriate for Prom.
9764,"He's right ,the colour is dull, but apparently you posted this so that people could crap on your bf and tell you ,how right you are,  to soothe your fragile ego."
9765,More power to you.
9766,"Uh, that's the definition of a formal dress appropriate for prom."
9767,It’s amazing!
9768,I would love to have that dress
9769,"He does realize that prom is the most formal of formals, right?"
9770,Or have things changed in the 23 years since I've gone to prom?
9771,Too much?????
9772,I had girls at my prom wearing whole ass ball gowns….
9773,He’s wrong.
9774,How in the hell is *that* not formal or elegant?
9775,?
9776,He's making you doubt your own judgement.
9777,Be careful with him
9778,That dress color is perfect for a prom.
9779,While prom was many moons ago my date had a light pink base dress that turned purple and blue and it went up and it was so cool.
9780,"Prom isn't about formal, proms about enjoying your youth and celebrating it with friends."
9781,"Don't let some dumb dumb say its not elegant, it is."
9782,Prom was never formal for me.
9783,The colour is so Cinderella!
9784,I love it.
9785,Sounds like he’s embarrassed of standing out.
9786,But there’s no need to tone things down for prom.
9787,"Not that many people actually get another chance for the rest of their life to wear a glamorous gown to an event (besides maybe their wedding) after prom, to be perfectly honest."
9788,"If you like to glam out, prom is the best time I can think of to do it."
9789,Is he a fashion student?
9790,Wear what you love to YOUR prom!!
9791,Any man who makes you doubt yourself is a man to block and delete sis.
9792,One of my major clients is a fashion house.
9793,"This is definitely formal, and very elegant."
9794,"It's not cocktail, which has become acceptable at proms, but it is, quite literally, the exact definition of women's formal wear."
9795,"It's very in line with what we see at Matric Dances in my country, which is basically prom."
9796,And what's wrong with the color?
9797,"It's a near-traditional women's formal wear color (see Cinderella for how long this has been in play)  


Sorry, hun."
9798,It's hard to read anything into this other than 'I wanted to perve on a girl in skyscraper heels and a bodycon cocktail dress and I am a teenage man so I'm going to flap my mouth like my opinion matters.'
9799,"He has, quite literally, no idea what 'formal' means in women's wear (clue: It means full length dress leaning ballgown type) and too unsophisticated to divorce 'elegant' and 'sexy'."
9800,"He was expecting to see booty and titties and he's disappointed they're not being exhibited, nothing more, just like every horndog teenage kid."
9801,"honey, you are setting a higher standard than he is willing to match."
9802,he wants you to lower yourself rather than bring himself up to your level.
9803,wear that gorgeous dress and put him out with the recycling
9804,Hi sib!
9805,He doesn't think the colour is formal?
9806,Then tell him it's Cinderella colour and thus perfectly formal.
9807,It's a special night and you get to be dressed in whatever makes you feel pretty.
9808,Forget themes- themes always flop.
9809,It’s YOUR prom!
9810,I remember my mom helping me find mine.
9811,I’m big breasted and was worried about showing too much cleavage.
9812,"I’d always been insecure and I remember my mom telling me “sweetie, you deserve to have a fun night in a beautiful dress."
9813,"If you can embrace a little cleavage, you should get it.” And boy was she right!!"
9814,I look back 7 years later and still adore my own “Cinderella” dress moment.
9815,Oh and the cleavage was stellar
9816,"Idk that there's a ""too much for prom"" you're meant to be dressing up and having fun, so dress up and have fun:)"
9817,The colour is beautiful and it suits you so well.
9818,Too much for prom??
9819,There were girls at my prom wearing ball gowns that would make Marie Antoinette blush.
9820,"You look amazing, prom is exactly the time wear princess gowns."
9821,It’s just right for prom.
9822,You wear it very well.
9823,I wish I had a dress like yours 😍
9824,"That blue is literally so elegant to me though, you look lovely!"
9825,There can be 2 forms of too much.
9826,1 is in a negative sense and that everyone will look at you strangely.
9827,"2 is closer to this case, where the dress is so stunning, that the too much doesn’t really matter."
9828,You’ll look absolutely breathtaking with the right hair and accessories.
9829,Though you might want to Ditch one ;)
9830,"Not a mom, but I’m old enough to be a dad now…."
9831,This is a good lesson in affirming your own style and taste.
9832,"You are you, you have your own styles and tastes, when you say “I like this no matter what someone else says” it will make you happy and help you carve out your ever evolving identity."
9833,In my life every time I’ve affirmed my personal taste and opinions (when they’re truly opinions at least) it’s felt more validating than most anything else.
9834,"Anyway, agree with other people 100% looks like a Disney princess dress and looks nice."
9835,"Prom is a special occasion, nothing wrong with having a special dress."
9836,"Trust me, at my high school, lots of people were in much less simple dresses than this and they were much less elegant!"
9837,What?!
9838,This color is beautiful!!
9839,"If I had color choices like this, I would have been so happy!"
9840,It’s far more elegant than hot pink or bright orange 🤣.
9841,I think it’s time to clue your BF into what compliments to avoid with women.
9842,"You look great, and this dress is beautiful."
9843,I went for my towns royalty and wore some of my old prom dresses.
9844,I wish I would have had a classic like this to wear instead of the bubblegum pink and lime greens that I had on hand.
9845,Tell him to cough up the money for a new dress or learn how to construct a compliment.
9846,You shouldn’t have to feel like you made a bad choice when it comes to prom dress.
9847,❤️
9848,My sister wanted to wear a short hot pink very poofy ballerina like dress.
9849,"Most senior prom dresses consisted of long, slender dresses."
9850,Both my parents were like “that’s… an interesting choice”.
9851,Her boyfriend didn’t care and told her to have fun.
9852,A lot of the teachers and her friends complimented her on it on the day of prom.
9853,"It’s been like 15 years since, and to this day she still thinks fondly of her dress and how she stuck with that decision."
9854,I hope that you too will think about your prom day like that and be happy you chose the dress you wanted.
9855,Because how you feel in that dress is all that counts :)
9856,The dress is stunning and perfect for prom.
9857,I would be extremely surprised if you were the only one in a dress like it on the night.
9858,How do you feel about the dress?
9859,How did you feel when you first showed him?
9860,When you are glowing in a moment of confidence when you feel beautiful there's a type of man who will be amazed by you.
9861,"Not your body, not your dress, the beauty of you in that moment."
9862,And there's a type of man who sees that light and needs to cut it down.
9863,"Maybe he is just young and wasn't used to seeing you dressed up like that and spoke in a way that was too mean, but if he regularly makes his feelings seem more important than yours it is time to put some thought into deciding if this relationship is valuable to you."
9864,Prom is literally the one that you go all in for!
9865,What a silly boy
9866,I mean it's not formal and elegant but obviously that what you wanted and what felt right/beautiful to you.
9867,For what reason do/did you choose this prom dress.
9868,"Did you tell him you like it and feel pretty in it, fits the style you want to express at prom?"
9869,"Edit: it is formal and elegant, it's just not a light slim dress."
9870,You should have mentioned your boyfriend was blind because anyone who could see would describe that dress as both formal and elegant.
9871,"You're meant to feel over the top and all out beautiful at your prom and this dress is certainly, elegant, formal and 100% prom appropriate!"
9872,I know a lot of teen dances have become a bit more casual.
9873,Girls tend to wear fitted cocktail dresses rather than ball gowns.
9874,I don’t know what it’s like at your school so maybe you might seem a bit more dressed up than the others.
9875,BUT I think the fact that proms have gotten more casual is totally disappointing.
9876,When else are you going to be able to wear a beautiful dress like this for fun??
9877,"There are not many adult occasions, that’s for sure."
9878,I LOVED wearing my fancy dresses to school dances.
9879,It was literally the best part.
9880,The dress is beautiful.
9881,Wear it and have a wonderful time.
9882,"Hell, do a photo shoot with it some time in the future!"
9883,It would look great against a winter backdrop or in some kind of nature.
9884,It’s honestly that beautiful.
9885,And he’s just straight up wrong about the color.
9886,It's actually very classic.
9887,Tell him to stuff it.
9888,It is very formal and very elegant.
9889,He obviously has ZERO TASTE.
9890,Does he think rhinestones and sequins = formal and elegant.
9891,That.
9892,Dress.
9893,Is.
9894,Gorge.
9895,It's a gorgeous color with your skin tone.
9896,As for too fancy...
9897,Odds are you will go to very few super formal events in life and this is one of them.
9898,What's he planning to wear?
9899,Jeans and a polo?
9900,Gimme a break.
9901,"If son shows up in less than slacks and a color-coordinated tie, go solo hon."
9902,It’s perfect for prom and there is no such thing as an ugly color.
9903,"Maybe he's worried OP looks so stunning in such a beautiful, well fitted dress that all the other boys will be chasing her, and he doesn't want to admit it for some reason?"
9904,"Or he just had really bad taste in dresses because OPs looks like something from a fairy tale if you ask me, the embroidery alone is to die for!"
9905,I really thought this was going to be much darker.
9906,"""Does he have eyes?"
9907,"He's not gonna."""
9908,"From a guys perspective, if I was buying a dress,that would in top 5 choice."
9909,Hahahahaha I didn’t get it til this comment and I love it!
9910,!
9911,cause he doesnt like a dress?
9912,*found the “boyfriend”*!
9913,"He’s allowed an opinion, however, she feels (and looks) fabulous in it, so it’s time to recognize that in THIS, his opinion doesn’t matter; and putting her down for no realistic reason, does HIM no favors."
9914,"Nope, it’s Reddit."
9915,The bf is toxic.
9916,/s
9917,Definitely!
9918,I think it’s the sleeves and dress cut!
9919,He’s also cut off from my “worlds best vegan brownies” and every baked food that I make from my family’s recipes!
9920,What is frito chili?
9921,And if he thought he was coming over for tacos he can think twice.
9922,No older brother food either!!
9923,And I make *amazing* chocolate chip cookies
9924,I can tell you how to make one!
9925,"I basically use a version of this for the sauce: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/simple-bolognese-recipe2-1956219.amp

But I chop everything very fine so the sauce is smoother and I add more garlic."
9926,I also put more parsley and basil and more red pepper.
9927,"Then, get some Polly-O and some mozz."
9928,Add an egg and some grated pecorino Romano.
9929,Combine with fresh parsley.
9930,Get layering.
9931,Undercook your lasagna noodles!
9932,Then on top put fresh mozz.
9933,Bake!
9934,You’re done.
9935,Serve with meatballs and a salad.
9936,Yeah dude here.
9937,Is it the most beautiful dress I’ve seen?
9938,Not by a long shot.
9939,I’m sure sure looks beautiful in it but it’s not for me.
9940,The appropriate answer from the boyfriend should have been: you look hot af in that.
9941,But come on guys.
9942,Give the poor dude a break.
9943,They’re 17.
9944,They’ll figure it out.
9945,Just tell him how it made you feel.
9946,"If he’s a good guy, he’ll understand and you’ll both have a great night."
9947,Be safe!
9948,Yup.
9949,Watch season 6 episode 4 of queer eye.
9950,They help out a class to do their senior prom in one week.
9951,They show a huge range of different styles of dresses for prom.
9952,Several are beautiful poofy princess dresses.
9953,It's gorgeous and the color is amazing on you.
9954,Exactly!!
9955,The only time I've had a more extravagant dress was at my own wedding!
9956,"My prom dresses were fantastic, I loooooved my first one, deep red that had a fitted bodice and flared out with lots of poof, with beads on the bodice and down past the waistline."
9957,The boy has no idea what he is talking about!
9958,"Wear the dress and deck it out with pearls, fancy gloves, and a tiara!"
9959,Because that is *exactly* what prom is for!
9960,!
9961,"And, like many other people have said, this one is elegant!"
9962,Oh man what was that one store in the mall back in the day?
9963,"It was like the Ross Dress for Less of the mall, they had a shitload of prom dresses deadass center but then they also had hip juniors clothes, discount club shoes, and they had THE BEST plus size section IMO of the late 90s/aughties.... Rainbow is similar, but not what I'm thinking of... That place was like a circus compared to this dress."
9964,"I'm like, ""This is 'too much'?"
9965,"I thought prom was like a toned-down-ridiculousness contest?"""
9966,"Wouldn't know, didn't go to mine (not because I think I'm cool but because I went to a nerd school and..."
9967,I mean what was even the point?
9968,"I would bet money that I read fanfiction that night, though I don't totally remember.)"
9969,I knew there was going to something that would bring all of human society together.
9970,I did not realize it would be a prom dress.
9971,But here we are.
9972,😁
9973,I hear this post motivated North Korea to become a democracy.
9974,"And just like that, the world united."
9975,"I’m currently in a hotel room and singing “come together.” Maybe next will be “imagine.” Don’t worry, I’m singing in a whisper."
9976,Tell your boyfriend that he has accomplished a unity of nearly mythical proportions.
9977,"No, wait!"
9978,Gasp!
9979,It’s the dress!
9980,"Behold, the power of the dress!"
9981,"Her problem is that she has an inert piece of garbage that might have costed her long hours of emotional labor, but in the end is not a good fit."
9982,And she also has her dress.
9983,"Here, here!"
9984,But is it blue and black or gold and white?
9985,"As a mother, I agree with this statement and think this dress would rock at prom."
9986,Wear that dress like a badge of honour.
9987,Nah its just all the other opinions got downvoted
9988,It's a nice dress!
9989,But not even close being to extravagant for fucking prom.
9990,">This isn't about him

Sooooo much this."
9991,This is YOUR dress and if you loved it before your boyfriend opened his mouth you can tell him to shut it.
9992,"This thread is nothing but opinions, you just happen to agree with them"
9993,She almost certainly asked for his opinion but alright.
9994,Weird amount of hate in this thread for the boyfriend when OP literally said he likes it and thinks it might just be too much for this event.
9995,Ridiculous that you people would want him to just lie if he felt the way he did.
9996,"You’re allowed to not like how clothing looks and as long as you express that in a way that isn’t rude (which OP seemed to say they were not rude), what are you doing wrong?"
9997,Also this is coming from a married man whose wife would kill him if I lied to her about liking/disliking what she wears when asked what I think.
9998,Other than matching his handkerchief colours to your dress (and even that isn't required) he shouldn't have any concerns about your dress other than making sure you like it and that it's relatively comfortable.
9999,">Someday someone is going to tell him that that never asked him for his opinion, and that they don't care what he thinks."
10000,She asked him for his opinion though
10001,">Since you've already bought it, his only intention in saying anything negative at this point is to bring you down and make you question yourself."
10002,"Or maybe, just maybe he doesnt like the dress?"
10003,"Third sister coming through with a reminder of what our grandmother would say…: *”What would he know about looking good, anyhow?"
10004,Men are like buses.
10005,There’ll be another one along in a minute.
10006,*
10007,This is what I hate about Reddit.
10008,"How can you possibly know literally anything about the guy and their relationship to state something like “he’s degrading and doesn’t love you” 

He doesn’t like the dress, and that’s the only thing you know."
10009,I’m a guy and tbh I don’t personally like the dress either.
10010,We are entitled to our opinions and it’s better to be honest with our partners rather than go through life only saying what they want to hear.
10011,Grow up
10012,">Also, you've mentioned elsewhere on this thread that he has said: ""it's not what [he] had in mind""."
10013,"Sis, this is the start of controlling and abusive behaviour; he is trying to control what you wear and - by extension - what you do."
10014,You can do soooo much better than this!
10015,"Kick his arse to the kerb ASAP

What the actual fuck lmao"
10016,That's great!
10017,"I saw your update too, it made me very happy."
10018,"I'm glad I dont have to worry about you, and that you've got such a great supportive boyfriend."
10019,Those communication skills are going to serve you both so well ❤
10020,"No, I dont think pretending to like it is better, I was just checking in with OP because the tone of his comment seemed a little intense."
10021,"She replied and made an update and it sounds like it was just a comment taken out of context, which is what I was hoping it was."
10022,"Truth is important, but how you speak the truth still matters!"
10023,"Being rude to your SO happens but if it's happening a lot or is part of a larger pattern of abuse, it's problematic."
10024,That was all i was saying
10025,I just wanted to check in with her!
10026,"She very sweetly replied to me, and she made an update."
10027,"Sounds like all is well, which is great news :)"
10028,"First thing I thought is that dress is beautiful, looks like Cinderella’s dress"
10029,I thought that too!
10030,Cinderella!
10031,"A nice updo hairstyle and some pearls, (even if they're fake....no one will know, shhhh!"
10032,"), and a tiny bit of flattering makeup, or even a tinted lip gloss, and OP is good to go!"
10033,Lol y’all got some very confused notions of what constitutes a good time
10034,OP's boyfriend : gives his opinion on a dress after being asked to.
10035,tells her he doesn't like it but she can still wear it if she wants.
10036,Everyone on Reddit : that boy is literally the devil.
10037,Because he gave his honest opinion about a dress?
10038,You’ve got to remember that 90% of Reddit are 14 year olds with 0 life experience.
10039,"There's not really ever a reason to tell someone you ""hate"" the dress."
10040,He can say he's not a fan without being rude.
10041,"But since the dress is bought and paid for, just smile and show the girl a pleasant evening."
10042,No I didn't.
10043,There is literally no reason to tell a young lady who already paid for a PROM dress that he hates it.
10044,"It's rude, it's unnecessary and he doesn't sound nice.... which is literally why I said that, but it seems you needed that explained to you."
10045,Lol ok
10046,It’s definitely not an ugly dress by any means.
10047,Not my taste but tbh I thought like 80% of the dresses at my prom were butt ugly lol.
10048,"Ya but, I wouldn’t be surprised if he said “I don’t like it that much, it’s a bit gaudy.” And she heard “I fucking hate it, you look fat.”"
10049,We’ve been together nearly two years - and he just doesn’t like the colour so we came to a compromise :) I’ve updated
10050,I hope it helped.
10051,Be safe and have a fun night.
10052,"Then I hope she's okay regardless, and if she's not, I hope she gets the help she needs."
10053,I agree
10054,Good bot!
10055,I would just ask one of my friends to borrow a different one.
10056,This looks like a tea party dress is all.
10057,I wore a black and green dress to prom in 08 but it showed cleavage and wasn't frilly.
10058,This post is in /all now.
10059,Ngl if you’re ‘out of the loop’ this seems like such a ‘please tell me I’m great and the people that don’t like me are arseholes’ sort of post.
10060,From what I've seen on this post?
10061,Online Coddling
10062,Back atcha.
10063,:)
10064,I thinks that's a stretch to say the least.
10065,You’re absolutely correct.
10066,But the law of averages definitely skews in a certain direction in fashion.
10067,Good bot
10068,My comments on this post are truth and not mean at all.
10069,If we are just posting looking for people to make them feel good or normalize being fat I guess that is what this post wants right?
10070,Not actual help on how to alter the dress to make it fit her body better.
10071,As for my other posts.... read them.
10072,You could probably be helped with a dose of reality.
10073,Thank you uncle.
10074,"Ooooh, pearls would be so fun!!"
10075,!
10076,Ohhh yeah.
10077,And a small retro style purse.
10078,My thoughts exactly.
10079,The colour suit her.
10080,"The style of the dress is timeless.Most importantly, the shape of the dress means that as the life goes on she will fit in it still or her future daughter can have it."
10081,Could become a family thing too!
10082,It is a good pick.
10083,Only if you let it.
10084,I can’t imagine many of the kids will be making fun of her for this one.
10085,Those mean people who make fun of others at prom are going to do that no matter what the clothes look like.
10086,are you still in highschool??
10087,because nothing anyone says to you in highschool should be affecting you in your adult life.
10088,Children are stupid and don't deserve that kind of space rent free in your mind.
10089,"The dress is fine, you need to stop caring about what other people think though."
10090,It's called SELF respect.
10091,"I’m several days late to reply to this, but I felt like it was important to reply anyway."
10092,I see your point and I can appreciate it.
10093,"It’s definitely a risk to put yourself out there, but this dress is very tame."
10094,I honestly think she will be happy with her choice for years.
10095,"Also, people who make fun of others in high school are ultimately afraid."
10096,They’re clinging to their last shreds of relevance and they know it.
10097,It’s high school and they’ve already peaked.
10098,They will never be cooler than they are right there in that moment.
10099,"As someone who got suspended for fighting a bully in high school, let me just say this: If someone was mean to you in high school and it’s still impacting your confidence, I will absolutely fight them."
10100,"I’m assuming they’re living very mediocre lives (but trying SO HARD to seem extra happy on social media), so it won’t be hard to bully them now."
10101,You are awesome.
10102,You deserve to feel awesome.
10103,I don't think you understand what a right is lol
10104,Wdym?
10105,He has the entitlement and right to voice out his opinion.
10106,"OP hasn't given any context as to in which *way* he voiced it out in, but if he expressed his opinion in a respectful manner, then the bf is not in any wrong."
10107,I always wanted big sis to tell me I'm doing fine and no need to compare myself to others.
10108,A piggy back ride would be great too
10109,Happy cake day
10110,"Moreover , OP admits her bf has a point because no one has ever worn something like this wherever she's at."
10111,I'm not the most fashionable or whatever but boy this dress looks tacky and dated.
10112,In such a situation I would 200% want my partner to tell me rather than being subject to sideways glances and whispers.
10113,It would help my mental health in the long run.
10114,Boyfriends come and go - but a good dress is forever ❤️
10115,Best comment ever.
10116,Sister here.
10117,I will tell him this if you don’t.
10118,"If I had an award to give, it would be yours!"
10119,Yes!!
10120,!
10121,Will you be my mom?
10122,Now THAT is some genuine mom advice
10123,"Yeah, I promise there will be nearly no opportunities outside of high school prom that you will get to wear a floofy princess dress, or ANY fancy formalwear."
10124,You got prom and your wedding and that’s about it.
10125,LIVE.
10126,IT.
10127,UP!
10128,!
10129,"If you can't wear it at prom, where CAN you wear it?"
10130,Floof it up princess!
10131,That’s the best time to go floofy.
10132,The fanciest dresses I've ever worn in my life are my prom dresses from high school and my wedding dress.
10133,Prom is when teenagers get to dress up in sequins and shit and have fun.
10134,"Exactly, there are very few times in a regular persons life (aka not going on a red carpet or to balls) that they get to wear a gorgeous gown!"
10135,"Basically prom and your wedding, that’s it!"
10136,I did that at my prom.
10137,No regrets.
10138,"It’s true, I haven’t had an occasion to wear a dress like that since."
10139,I've never understood this trend.
10140,I wore a whispy black dress with sparkle beads and spaghetti straps and everyone was jealous and overheating.
10141,Mine cost 80 bucks.
10142,You'll never wear this thing again.
10143,But this one isn't as gaudy as most so not sure what he's off about.
10144,Methinks the boyfriend knows how many compliments she’ll get and is jealous 🙄 I adore this dress and everyone else will too!
10145,Even some wedding dresses work!
10146,Had a friend in high school who bought a short wedding dress as her prom dress.
10147,It.
10148,Was.
10149,Fire.
10150,She looked AMAZING.
10151,Lol.
10152,This one.
10153,Be a princess.
10154,Get a small tiara to go with it.
10155,"“Don’t let his negativity talk you out of something you love.” Wise, wise words that every girl should take to heart!"
10156,"Also, never stay with a man that makes you feel anything but beautiful."
10157,And do not put any store in the tastes of teenage boys - they love stupid things like video games and fast cars and porn.
10158,I don't care for him one bit
10159,Silver!
10160,Yes!
10161,👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
10162,Yes.
10163,[deleted]
10164,Ugh sounds like my high school boyfriend.
10165,What a dumpster
10166,"Omg, that was my high school boyfriend, who I stupidily married right after high school."
10167,He was like this clown.
10168,Told me I looked bad in things I looked good in because he wanted me to look bad in public on purpose.
10169,"Then he’d tell me “see, no one else finds you attractive, you’re lucky I’m with you.” 

OP, please see your worth, please see that you are beautiful and the dress looks great, the color is awesome."
10170,You are awesome.
10171,"The boy, not so much at all."
10172,"IMPO don't make excuses for men, most of them are hot garbage."
10173,I sometimes worry about looking too fancy.
10174,Even as an adult I worry about wearing too nice of clothes to work or out to dinner.
10175,Her bf may be worried about standing out and may not like the spotlight on him that he’ll get by being next to her.
10176,But he should say that instead of complaining about the dress.
10177,Or maybe he just doesn’t like the dress I mean ya know not everyone is sinister
10178,saved just in case my friend starts venting to me about her boyfriend saying something rude about her outfits
10179,Looks like a child dressing up not a young lady in a dress
10180,Lmao look at my post history.
10181,I'm an old grandma and even I wouldn't suggest a big no on this
10182,"She asked his opinion and got it, it's a simple as that, just a bunch of man haters"
10183,Cause he don't like the dress?
10184,Edit: just seen the /s lol
10185,As well as my third generation Pumpkin Roll that has gotten pop quizzes excused when I was in college.
10186,Chili that tastes top notch with Fritos!
10187,Ohhhh my friend… you’ve never had a frito pie?!
10188,"So you get you a bowl, then you get some Fritos, I prefer the scoops but whatever you fancy is fine, then you get your favorite chili, I like to use my husbands homemade stuff but the can will do as well."
10189,"You warm the chili, top the Fritos with the chili, add lots of shredded cheddar cheese and if you’d like, some diced onions and sliced jalapeños."
10190,Eat.
10191,"Thank you so much for this, you are very wholesome and it sounds to die for."
10192,I will attempt this to quench the insatiable hunger I have for Italian food.
10193,Saving this comment for later
10194,Yeah this comment section is absurd with how everyone's assuming that the guy is controlling or abusive off of a single negative comment?
10195,"They're in high school, chill."
10196,Devil's advocate.
10197,This prom at this exact school may be less extravagant.
10198,Or he probably just don't know what people wear for proms.
10199,And using a show as inspiration is a bit silly imo.
10200,But also goes to show as you say that prom is most likely extravant.
10201,But I 100% agree  she should wear it and talk it out.
10202,"All it probably boils down to is him being afraid of attention, while people at this age shouldn't really care about that."
10203,Enjoying the time together and having fun is all that matters.
10204,Whether you get attention or not.
10205,Wanting to be like a princess this is the perfect time for it and enjoying it no matter how anyone may or may not think.
10206,So wear it and enjoy it!
10207,Right??
10208,Here we are 😄
10209,Yes!
10210,I love this gold dress!
10211,"You had me in the first half, I was ready to go OFF 😂"
10212,Yes.
10213,Found the boyfriend
10214,"The title of her post “my boyfriend hates it.” 

She may have asked for his opinion but when prom is a few days away and you’ve spent hundreds of dollars on a gown, now is the time for reassurance not “I don’t like it.”"
10215,Then he can keep his opinion to himself!
10216,She's already bought it so to say something now when she can't do anything about it but question herself only serves to take away her confidence.
10217,She obviously loved the dress.
10218,"LPT: only give negative opinions on a person's appearance that they can fix in under a minute (there's something in your teeth, tp on your shoe, etc.)."
10219,"To suggest someone should go dress shopping all over again or they are too fat or something is just an insult, not helpful, often very damaging"
10220,The fourth sister coming through.
10221,My sisters are right.
10222,You need someone that lifts you up.
10223,"A man that makes you feel badly, insecure and uncomfortable is the wrong man."
10224,Think about this.
10225,Please reflect on this honey.
10226,"Btw, what grandma said is true."
10227,Your grandmother doesn’t hold back.
10228,I choked laughing.
10229,Wise words!
10230,"*It's not my taste, but you look really happy in it."
10231,"*
Is a truthful statement, as well."
10232,That's fair enough.
10233,"I was merely saying what I said because everyone in this thread was acting like the boyfriend was satan himself, when we only know half the story!"
10234,"Given the potential ambiguity, and that very young people are involved here, I would have chosen a more on-the-fence take than most people here."
10235,Yours is one of the most mild here.
10236,"The worst is, she may go and then be like ""damn that was one ugly dress"" in 5 years."
10237,"Just because this sub cannot say ""yes honey is not the best one"""
10238,That's because most people giving device here are just bitter old women jealous of others being in happy relationships.
10239,"Like seriously, a boyfriend says he doesn't like his girlfriend's dress and they're all ""yass kweeen dump his ass he's literally Hitler trying to murder ypu."
10240,"Get out as fast as you can"""
10241,"I forgo that, probably the number one rule of reddit."
10242,I need to get out of the front page man
10243,"""Be honest, do you hate it?"""
10244,"There, thats your reason."
10245,"Being married just a couple years, I had been asked that a few times, I lied like half of them."
10246,Yeah I wonder what the exact wording is.
10247,"Honestly, this isn’t something that people wear to prom in my area."
10248,So I can see the thought that it wasn’t what he expected.
10249,High schoolers are weird.
10250,You want to fit in but you also want to be an individual.
10251,But that's the whole point of the subreddit.
10252,It's for people that never have heard words of encouragement irl so they turn to a place where is guaranteed.
10253,It's not always a bad thing to ask questions where you want a specific answer
10254,"Well, it kind of is."
10255,But does that justify being mean on the internet?
10256,And assuming someone must be something just ‘because statistics’ is ignorant at best.
10257,"Thank you, Bubbles_hXc, for voting on Shakespeare-Bot."

10262,"OP, I just showed this to my husband - a grown up boy - and he responded with, “Dress is fine."
10263,He’s an idiot.”
10264,deadass this is the truth and thats why you need to be comfortable in your own skin.
10265,It's not theirs so they don't have anything to complain about.
10266,And its no doubt a jealousy thing if they do make fun
10267,Exactly.
10268,"It doesn't matter what you wear when the point isn't about the clothes, it's about tearing someone else down to make themselves feel better."
10269,Shitty people are going to shit on others for reasons that go deeper than them simply not liking a dress.
10270,"If not the dress, it will be anything else they can latch onto, any other insecurity they can prey on, because the problem is within them."
10271,Doesn't mean you should wear a ahegao shirt tho.
10272,No reason to give them ammo.
10273,ooooh ok so you're playing with semantics.
10274,Bye.
10275,as a man who was once a boy... most likely boys are dumb and unknowingly mean.
10276,"So, I'm gonna assume the thing that is most likely."
10277,"Besides, they talked about it and he learned."
10278,"So he isn't as dumb anymore which is good, and part of the process."
10279,I was calling that person a cock for just simplifying something that is more complex than he let on.
10280,You are doing fine and you have no need to compare yourself to others.
10281,You are unique and wonderful.
10282,I don't have to know you to know that.
10283,I am sorry I am too physically weak to give piggy back rides.
10284,- your big sis
10285,I’m 4’11” but I can try to give ya a piggy back :)
10286,A big sis to two siblings here!
10287,You're doing amazing and you're going to be great.
10288,"Don't let other peoples business nag ya too much and keep doing your thing, one step at a time."
10289,Unfortunately I'm shit at giving piggy back rides but if you're okay with falling over then hop on
10290,omg yes!!
10291,my dress for prom was amazing.
10292,I remember it more than my date.
10293,😌
10294,Can second this.
10295,"Junior year boyfriend didn't last into senior year, but damn!"
10296,That dress made me look like a Bond Girl!
10297,I relate so hard to this.
10298,"Haven't met my prom date in a decade but my prom dress is still in the closet if my childhood room and everytime I home for the holidays and see it while cleaning my room, it brings a smile on my face."
10299,Exactly!!!
10300,"The dress shouldn’t be for her boyfriend, it should be for her and she looks stunning in it!"
10301,The color is beautiful and compliments her skintone so well.
10302,"If her boyfriend wants to make her feel bad, he can stay at home while she makes awesome memories at prom."
10303,Make sure to get some prom photos without the BF in them
10304,So make sure you get some good pics without the boyfriend!
10305,And can be passed down.
10306,Is the boyfriend not allowed to have an opinion on the dress.
10307,Like what if he really doesn’t like it?
10308,Is that not allowed?
10309,You act like he verbally abused her about the dress.
10310,What is wrong with you?
10311,And prom is the only one where you aren't expected to pick a dress that doesn't clash with the tablecloths and floral arrangements.
10312,Go all out on a prom dress.
10313,Ditch the boyfriend.
10314,"This is a good sentiment, but also, I'm a proponent of wearing princess dresses just because you feel like it."
10315,I've put on my most expensive dresses just to go hang out and buy some groceries.
10316,"Live your life whenever and however you want, if you're not hurting anyone!"
10317,I actually wore mine again for my college SR formal.
10318,I had it altered from floor length to tea length and love getting a second wear since I loved it so much the first time!
10319,Exactly this!!
10320,"And men also prefer tight fitted dresses for obvious reasons lol, they'd always go sexy over princess, they're the same when it comes to a wedding dress, but it's your prom!"
10321,I think it's breath taking and the norm for proms where I live in UK
10322,Exactly.
10323,"There are plenty of occasions to wear short slinky dresses that many wear to prom, but rarely will you get to wear foofery."
10324,Not everyone finds out they're a princess of Genovia randomly.
10325,Military Balls!
10326,I had a giant floofy ball gown!
10327,"As a former Marine, I still go to the birthday Ball, and invite a lady to attend so she can fancy up like this."
10328,Go work in nonprofit.
10329,Fucking galas.
10330,Charity dinners and balls are another great opportunity to dress up like a princess.
10331,"Hopefully, we'll go back to having them soon."
10332,Halloween
10333,"This makes me kinda sad lol, wish I had gotten to wear a floofy princess dress to prom haha."
10334,"Can confirm, a tiara really completes the look at prom since you’ll never wear it again except for maybe at your wedding."
10335,">OPs looks like something from a fairy tale

That's what I thought too!"
10336,It's a perfect Cinderella at the ball dress!
10337,I hope you’re free now?
10338,Hah yeah most men and women are garbage for sure
10339,The second part of what I said was pretty much that?
10340,Maybe the dude just doesn't know what a beautiful dress should look like?
10341,I'm not sure the point you were trying to make?
10342,What?
10343,A women centric subreddit is misandrist?
10344,No way!
10345,No more of my family’s best pressure cooker chili for that jerk!
10346,"Don’t forget the sour cream, fam"
10347,"That does sound super tasty, but fritos don't exist in my country."
10348,Would Doritos work too?
10349,[deleted]
10350,"even me, i'm here too!"
10351,notgonalie.gif
10352,Yikes.. asks for an opinion but doesn’t want the truth.
10353,The boyfriend should leave her 🚩
10354,Grandma is always right.
10355,Too much for a fifth sister?
10356,"Girl, you look stunning."
10357,I hate that someone is making you doubt yourself.
10358,You deserve someone who makes you feel beautiful in old sweatpants and your prom dress.
10359,Our sisters and grandma are right.
10360,"I will not pass judgment on your relationship, but I hope you will reflect on it."
10361,"Yea but that doesn’t change the Reddit hive mind of “break up, he doesn’t love or respect you” based on one little detail we’re given."
10362,"No one is perfect, everyone has their moments."
10363,"No one goes through decades of marriage without having problems, and breaking up or divorcing isn’t always the answer for little issues that can be solved simply with better communication"
10364,Yes I always feel bad when my comment starts a thread that goes in a weird or bad direction.
10365,"I'm glad that in this case it sounds like all is well


Hope you're having a good day!"
10366,"And nice guy incels

""""There has to be a better guy out there than this little chucklehead""""(hint hint its me, mr nice guy y do girls always go for douchebags??)"
10367,Being married 15 I know to be nice.
10368,OP posted this in reply to another comment.
10369,"""He said he thinks it’s too extravagant and it’s not what he had in mind for prom."
10370,No one has ever worn anything close to this so it makes sense.
10371,"He said he likes the dress in general and if I want to I should wear it."""
10372,I’m not against it mate.
10373,Just explaining why you might see some negative comments etc.
10374,It's not /r/encouragement though
10375,"Yes especially when most of the top comments are terrible downright stupid advice by bitter old women that are simply not helping this teen out but actually doing more damage

The dress is really nice but is it a bit much?"
10376,"Yes 
The BF said something hurtful but was he truthful and right?"
10377,"Yes 

Yet the comments say its a perfect dress and to dump the bf it's a sad gaggle of meddling women not actual motherly advice I saw two comments that were truthful and that's it"
10378,Lmao awesome husband!
10379,hubby passes the vibe check :)
10380,I also concour with your husband's response.
10381,"That dress is awesome and the ""boyfriend"" is an idiot."
10382,41 yr old boy here.
10383,The dress in OP's pictures is not comparable to a Tshirt.
10384,No reason to shit on their choices.
10385,Guess guys can't have options on their prom or wedding :)
10386,Big assumption.
10387,"Personally, if I'm wearing something my wife doesnt think looks good I want too know."
10388,"If you're on your way to the event there's no point, you're going to make them worry when there's nothing they can do about."
10389,You think.boys can be mean.. you should see how teenage girls can be.
10390,Sounds like you make comments without engaging your brain first.
10391,"Without context, it really is that simple."
10392,"Big sisters, we have a job to do."

10400,**
10401,I still have my prom dress!
10402,"The date however, I couldn't tell you where he is to save my life hahah"
10403,Are they really that big of a deal?
10404,My side hustle was making prom dresses whole I was in high school and I never really put that much thought into how memorable they might be.
10405,That said I'm a dude who skipped prom sooo.
10406,I regret my date for my senior prom but I will never regret that dress.
10407,"Hell if there were even a slight chance I could fit into it ever again, I’d probably marry in it too!"
10408,!
10409,Absolutely!
10410,"I remember every dress, couldn’t care less about the dates anymore"
10411,"Literally cannot remember the name of the guy who took me to prom, but I remember how that dress made me feel 🥰"
10412,I came here to say this.
10413,"He's for sure not the one, and that dress looks BEAUTIFUL on you."
10414,You need a partner who will only care how YOU feel in your dress.
10415,"Also, he can wear whatever dress he likes to suit his tastes."
10416,Rock that shit girl.
10417,And have a great time!
10418,"Edit: I came back after taking a closer look at your pics- serious fairy tail vibes, like go watch Enchanted right this minute and find yourself a bomb ass tiara and some woodland creatures to accompany you instead of some lame not-supportive-wannabe-fashion-critic dude."
10419,"Make sure you bring comfy shoes, have a plan to stay hydrated, and don't let anyone talk you into a wrist corsage."
10420,💜mom
10421,"hell, my prom dress cost 3x as much as the dress I got married in."
10422,prom dresses are for making yourself feel good and NOBODY else gets to say what that is.
10423,"After the Marine Corps Ball one year, my husband and I went out for fast food in our formal wear.... it was so much fun"
10424,"Also, Tiara Tuesday is totally a thing."
10425,Love it!
10426,!
10427,Excellent!
10428,This is another exception to the rule.
10429,"Thanks for reminding us of this, too."
10430,You sound like a much better date than OP’s boyfriend.
10431,Thanks for giving your lady friends a chance to be a princess!
10432,That’s why I said almost.
10433,"I’ve been to the Emmy’s 15 times and get to wear fancy stuff, but I am an exception."
10434,Most ladies never get the chance again.
10435,I thank my husband who has been nominated 16 times and won twice for the chance.
10436,"Pfft, forget that!"
10437,Girls' night?
10438,Game night?
10439,Social zoom call?
10440,*Break out that tiara*.
10441,Have your friends bring their own.
10442,"Be royalty together, live your best life!"
10443,It would make a great wedding dress!
10444,I wore something similar for mine because I wanted to be Cinderella for a day.
10445,😁
10446,And you should OWN it at the prom!
10447,Announce yourself as Princess Awesome!
10448,Many fundraiser type Galas would welcome this tasteful attire and the lovely lady who is wearing it.
10449,Counterpoint: I ordered myself a fancy tiara to wear at my belated 40th birthday last year and I regret nothing.
10450,Tiaras RULE.
10451,Yes!
10452,"Pair it with some lace or satin elbow length gloves, a small tiara and a simple necklace for a classic fairytale look!"
10453,Very much so.
10454,Married to an amazing man who treats me with love and respect.
10455,Please close the lid to your dumpster.
10456,Or maybe he should stfu & learn some basic consideration.
10457,Yeah.
10458,That part.
10459,Are you implying that that's how it should be?
10460,"Funny that lol if we do it it's 'toxic masculinity' but when you do it there's nothing wrong with it, hopeid say you have a wonderful love life lol DRY AF"
10461,I'm hungry now.
10462,Can we all meet up for a picnic?
10463,I used to bartend so I can whip up some drinks for us too!
10464,My bad.
10465,"Yes, must have sour cream."
10466,"Damn it, now I’m hungry."
10467,They will work.
10468,"Not to the same exact taste, but they will be good."
10469,I hope you enjoy.
10470,Doritos would be...different.
10471,"Fritos are just a thick, fried corn based chip, so I'd go with any cornchip you can find."
10472,Tortilla chips would also work.
10473,Anything crunchy and salty
10474,Sounds like 'lazy nachos' at our house.
10475,"Plate, Doritos, some chunky Dorito dip, cheese, sour cream."
10476,"(Bonus points for 'what ever you have laying around, like avocado, sambals olek if you like it Hot, chives,last night's spag bog (spaghetti Bolognese meat) etc)."
10477,"Nuke it (microwave, probably be four the sour cream, enough for cheese to melt)."
10478,Eat.
10479,If she has already bought her prom dress?
10480,Yes.
10481,Lie.
10482,"Would you tell your wife you don’t like her wedding dress, even if you don’t?"
10483,This is a special memory when you are supposed to feel beautiful and grown up.
10484,He should support her in that rather than making her feel insecure.
10485,"That being said, OP I truly do think it’s a beautiful dress and completely appropriate for prom."
10486,ETA I’m not saying this guy is trash but his reaction *was* rude.
10487,"California in solidarity, gorgeous dress confirmed"
10488,Are you freaking LOST???
10489,This is r/MomForAMinute!
10490,Get back to AITA where you obviously think you are.
10491,Hell no!
10492,Your words are perfect.
10493,💖
10494,Lol.
10495,So true.
10496,Incels are larping on this sub too.
10497,See I don’t think that’s so bad.
10498,Maybe he’s trying to protect her from being made fun of?
10499,It’s not like he said it was ugly.
10500,Or she looked fat.
10501,Or that it wasn’t sexy enough.
10502,"And yeah I agree that the top comments here are pretty cringe, but you weren't much better up to this point"
10503,This comment is much better and more helpful than your original comment.
10504,It may even not have popped up when sorting after controversial
10505,"If you marry a woman and her wedding dress shocks you, what are you doing in that relationship?"
10506,That scenario reads failed communication and a hasty decision.
10507,without engaging my brain first.......what a waste of time it was to read your comment.
10508,I’m ready!
10509,"My big sis was basically my mom, and I miss her every single day since she passed in 2007."
10510,I’ll do my best to fill in for her.
10511,I had to seriously think about who I brought to prom.
10512,The dress though?
10513,Perfection.
10514,I guess it depends on how important it is to you personally.
10515,I went with a group of friends and I’ve always liked dressing up.
10516,Ain’t that the truth!!!
10517,Same here.
10518,"u/agentgaitor Your entire Edit made me smile.. OP, do this!"
10519,You still have time to find adoring woodland creatures to accompany you haha
10520,Also agree with the edit here!
10521,"(And the rest of the comment) the dress is stunning, that embroidery is amazing and definitely getting Enchanted vibes."
10522,"OmG I adore this idea, If someone said that I should tone it down I’m definitely one to go above and beyond."
10523,Yes!
10524,Tierra and woodland creatures maybe even a purse in the shape of a flower.
10525,Great advice on the wrist corsage as well.
10526,I recently was hanging out at a local taproom and a group of people in very nice Victorian-style formal wear came in.
10527,It made my day.
10528,I think seeing people on formal wear or costume/cosplay doing regular things is fun.
10529,Congratulations to your husband.
10530,And condolences on your feet.
10531,"My friend is planning a ""Wear Whatever You Haven't Worn in Forever"" party now that covid numbers are dropping in our state."
10532,I'm debating between a formal dress and my Ren Faire outfit.
10533,Tiara Tuesday's for the win!
10534,Such Brandy Cinderella vibes.
10535,Don't wear a tiara.
10536,Or gloves.
10537,The dress doesn't require any jewellery.
10538,I'm sorry?
10539,Not at all.
10540,Just saying that it's expected on Reddit.
10541,Sure!
10542,I’ll make sure to make bring lots of napkins.
10543,My chili can be kinda messy.
10544,Make sure to not invite OP’s “boyfriend!”
10545,Thank you!
10546,It's not a wedding
10547,Lmao but he also didn’t shit on it.
10548,How do u know his reaction?
10549,"She literally said in the title “he hates it”, then in the comment she said “he likes the dress in general”."
10550,Now everyone is just assuming he’s abusive and rude.
10551,Wtf is wrong with you people lmao
10552,"Australian chiming in, I wish I had worn a dress like this to my formal  (Australian version of prom) 

It is stunning, if I were at your prom I would be so envious I'd be green."
10553,This isn't AITA?
10554,Then why is everyone calling the boyfriend an asshole for his valid opinion?
10555,This was my exact thought.
10556,If a friend asked me what I thought of this dress I’d probably say “you look great in it” but I’d also let them know that they’d look a lot different from the dresses most people would be wearing.
10557,"Her boyfriend was probably even more concerned about her getting there and feeling self conscious so he probably pushed a little harder for her to wear something that won’t stick out as much

It doesn’t seem like this is coming from some horrible superficial place"
10558,"I'm not the original commenter you replied to btw 

And I don't really get how I was the same as them for calling out coddling"
10559,I know you'll do your best.
10560,- your big sis
10561,Interesting now I kinda wonder if any of the dresses I made are etched into someone's memory.
10562,"Not quite formal, but I just bought a bunch of  hobbity type clothes for me to start wearing more everyday."
10563,"I am ready to just be ME, screw what anyone else things."
10564,Thank and daaamn.
10565,It used to be hell!
10566,Now I have orthotics and plantar fasciitis and can only wear flats with my orthotics.
10567,The only comments I’ve ever had were from Jane Fonda herself at the Newsroom after party.
10568,She was in a suit and chain smoking with tennis shoes on.
10569,"She saw my shoes and lifted her pant leg and said with a cigarette in her mouth, “hell yeah.”  That was it."
10570,Her real voice is very gravelly.
10571,It was so funny.
10572,She was just happy being comfy in her pants and tennis shoes.
10573,How long is the party?
10574,"Start in one, switch halfway through"

10578,That dress is lovely!!
10579,Make sure you click a ton of solo pics minus the boyfriend.
10580,😀
10581,Yeah.
10582,"Dress looks great @ OP, but I'm a little disappointed at everyone for bashing the boyfriend for an opinion just as valid as everyone else."
10583,"Jesus, OP herself said the boyfriend wasn't forcing her to change or had some super strong ""eww wtf is this"" opinion, why is everyone just assuming he's a creep/asshole/all of the above?"
10584,Smooth moves slick
10585,Oof lol sorry.
10586,Nah you're good :P
10587,"Thank big sis, you’re already doing great!"
10588,*your big sis
10589,I’ll bet they definitely did.
10590,"I still have mine, although realistically I will never wear it again."
10591,I should probably give it away.
10592,lol
10593,I feel you.
10594,"My husband is 6'9""."
10595,My plantar fasciitis and flatfeet from extensive heels set in at 29.
10596,I like the way you think!
10597,"You know, sometimes I look at a before and after picture and I can’t tell which is which, because they both look good, but different."
10598,"That was the case here on first glance, but then I realized that in one of them you’re hiding, and in the other you look so sparkling and happy."
10599,"That’s so nice to see, it does my heart good."
10600,And have you found your way to the curly hair forums?
10601,Because you’re doing such a nice job with those curls now.
10602,I know from experience with a skill it is to get good at that.
10603,Well done!
10604,My love you have the most beautiful smile.
10605,"You look so confident and joyful, I’m so happy that you’ve made it this far on your journey!"
10606,"I hope, the next time you get your nails done, you take a moment to look at your hands."
10607,"The hands your mother made, hands that carry her blood and her history, hands that she loved and held years ago, and you remember those hands are a part of her."
10608,"You’ll never really get your nails done with out her, you are forged from her."
10609,Thank you for sharing your absolutely stunning glow up!
10610,"Wow, I didn’t think this post would get this kind of traction."
10611,"Thank you to all the Moms, aunties, grannies, sisters and brothers!"
10612,"You’re words have made me giggle, good cry and do a lot of thinking."

10647,You can still have those moments with your mom in your heart.
10648,Why don’t you try it and see how you like it?
10649,You’re GLOWING and your hair is goals!
10650,🤩
10651,The joy I see in the right hand photo is so stunningly beautiful.
10652,"It’s more than just your outward appearance, which is of course beautiful as well, but it’s a beauty that comes from being at peace with yourself."
10653,"I am sorry that you never got the mother/daughter experience you yearned for, duckling."
10654,"I know this may not help with the pain you feel at this moment, but I feel that through you is a lesson that others can learn to not be afraid to be who they are and be honest with those around you."
10655,You are abso-fucking-lutely gorgeous!
10656,"Not just the physical appearance(*which is brilliant*), but your soul/spirit is GLOWING!"

* 1 handful of leftover steak, chicken, or other meat of your choice (optional)
* 1/2 cup of a soft white bean like cannellini or great northern
* 1/2 cubed avocado
* 1 fried, poached, or scrambled egg (each will give the salad a slightly different experience, best if yolk is still runny)
* 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
* Juice of 1/2 lemon

Layer salad, meat, and beans on a plate or bowl."

11824,Proud of you for staying true to yourself.
11825,"wow ...couldn guess this as brother and sister in the same pic but never the same person ...although it is ...nice work you :) .....if you dont mind the suggestion , i know it wont replace the actual loss you feel and the fact you couldnt do those things but it might be cathartic to go to an old persons home or even find a woman who is older and lives alone and get to know her and take her out for some of those things ....its a win win win situation because im sure they would love to ""mom"" you while you enjoy the experience almost as much as you would have with your own mum ....and dont let it haunt you as im sure you own mum would definitely have been proud of how brave and genuine and im guessing empathetic and kind you are ...so while we dont always get what we want sometimes we dont see that we have what we need ...which kinda doesnt mean much but it sounded good in my head :) anyhoo take care and wish you much life love and laughter for all your days 

oh and PS if you find a retirement village or something you can maybe find a few different older ladies and split your time from time to time"

11954,!
11955,Thank you oh so much!
11956,❤️
11957,Red and Pink were always our favorite colors!
11958,❤️
11959,I am absolutely happy with myself and taking this step was the most important and best decision I’ve ever made in my life.
11960,I know she passed wondering why I was always so depressed with a hatred for life.
11961,"But hoping she can see me now, happy and thriving."
11962,"So it takes a bit of work, I primarily use DevaCurl products."
11963,"Lowpoo Delight and it’s matching conditioner when washing hair and I’m talking like really condition, so run it through out your hair very slowly, deliberately and make sure to squish it all together so it really absorbs into your strands."
11964,I let it sit for five minutes plus and at that point I start using a detangling brush to break up the strands softly with causing major hurtful breakage to my hair.
11965,"Finally right as you finish showering and your hair is sopping wet, I use DevaCurl’s Ultra defining gel, again making sure to really run it through all strands and then squenching it further."
11966,I then part my hair and either let it air dry (A five or so hour process with my dense hair) or if I’m in a hurry I diffuse it on the lowest heat and fan setting.
11967,The thing with curl definer is that it’ll form a cast when you eventually have to break by squishing after it’s fully locked your hair shape in.
11968,That’s why I tend to plan my wash days after work before dinner and bed.
11969,"By the time my cast is ready to be broken, I actually put my hair in a silk bonnet (which I do every night regardless of wash day or not) this helps because as I sleep and toss and turn through the night it naturally breaks the cast that way."
11970,"Then in the mornings, I wake up remove my cap shake out my hair and then style it and kinda floof it with my hands applying some Argan oil on my hands when I do so."
11971,I have extremely curly hair so I never brush it as it would destroy the curls.
11972,Kinda a lot but my curly girl journey has been illuminating and it’s one of my favorite features about myself.
11973,💜
11974,I still have it and more now!

12574,"Here is a good link explaining why we use 'camping'

https://phoebecohen.medium.com/why-are-women-suddenly-talking-about-camping-593f7067ae17"
12575,Hi sweets.
12576,There's a certain decision that just got issued that affects people with a uterus.
12577,Some of those people now have far fewer rights today than they had when they went to bed last night.
12578,So going camping in other places may help them feel free to access those rights.
12579,My heart is breaking for women in the US today especially as South Australia has just decriminalised camping here
12580,"It's not one of the state'swith an automatic shutdown, but in all likelihood, Georgia will be banning camping in the near future."
12581,Camping in Canada is encouraged!
12582,"For Canadiens it's free, unfortunately not free for people coming from abroad."
12583,But there's a hotline I think where you can get info how to get funded for it.
12584,"“Camping” es una analogía, están hablando de otro tema (lo que está en todos los diarios...)"
12585,That would be amazing.
12586,We absolutely should start a list.
12587,"The topic is about the recent ruling that will ban something (i.e., camping) for women who need to camp in some parts of the US."
12588,That’s not the kind of camping they’re talking about.
12589,Did you figure it out yet?
12590,It's something that's been very much in the news.
12591,"These particular ""camping trips"" are likely to a different state and must be held in perpetual secrecy, and those going on the camping trips may well need some extra support, both financial and emotional."
12592,"Also, the use of the word ""person"" is trans inclusive, knowing that some trans men may need to take a camping trip."
12593,That's a great question I would love the answer to as well.
12594,Troll gonna troll.
12595,Reported.
12596,imagine if courts one day made a decision that paved the way to allow individual states to ban camping
12597,Why?
12598,Montana is also a great place to camp.
12599,Let’s keep it that way.
12600,Campers are always welcome to reach out for information about local camp sites.
12601,We may close due to a moronic change in our color but we are still free to camp now.
12602,I’m happy to help.
12603,I hope that American women can call on their Canadian friends to go camping.
12604,Minnesota too!
12605,"Depending on your part of Canada, you might usually do your camping at a hospital, because camping is fucking healthcare."
12606,They're not talking about that kind of camping.
12607,Colorado mom here.
12608,Good camping to be had.
12609,Oh man that's so sweet.
12610,This post was originally meant to help out ladies seeking travel help to a pro-choice state but I will 100% help you coordinate an actual camping trip.
12611,"r/iwantout has some pretty good faq answers etc, if you want to lurk there."
12612,Best of luck mate.
12613,[deleted]
12614,Kids should always have the option to move back with parents if they need to.
12615,"I hope if that’s not an option for you, or if your parents live in a state that’s hostile to campers you’ll come here and stay with us."
12616,"Just to warn you, that includes living with a noisy calico and an even noisier 12 yr old boy."
12617,His dad and I are significantly quieter.
12618,"We don’t have a bedroom for you, but we do have a super giant comfy couch."
12619,We love your neighbors to the north.
12620,"Thank you, Canada."
12621,I'd like my Ontarian campers to stay vigilant.
12622,"Health care is slowly being privatized, and who knows what Ford will allow during his next term."
12623,Won’t they have to pay out of pocket in the states too?
12624,Deductibles are pretty high from what I heard.
12625,Wait times aren’t too bad.
12626,I had mine within a week.
12627,"There are many groups and individuals willing to
help with that, and if they live somewhere where they don’t feel comfortable googling who can help or any general info about camping, they can just post on this subreddit and all the moms will gladly search and post info for them."
12628,[deleted]
12629,Why not?
12630,Which is fucking nuts.
12631,"I’m a Mexican and Mexican culture is heavily machista, and heavily catholic."
12632,It’s wild to me that a country with a catholic majority is more progressive in this area of healthcare than th USA.
12633,"If only we could work something out with the [Federal Forest Service](https://i.imgur.com/dGI6ugC.png), maybe a FEMA campsite or three in each state?"
12634,CA mom ready to be here for anyone who needs to come camping!
12635,I’m with you.
12636,"Yep, there are a number of great camping spots round California."
12637,I can give advice and even join in a trip around Northern California
12638,CA here!
12639,I'm super proud of my state right now.
12640,"It's a great place for a nice week-long camping trip, plus they just announced that camping activities will be available to anyone as well."
12641,"Yep, there are a number of great camping spots round California."
12642,I can give advice and even join in a trip around Northern California
12643,Yep.
12644,Bumpity bump.
12645,Free apps sell your data.
12646,Anyone can buy it.
12647,Yep yep.
12648,Apps aren’t bound by HIPAA.
12649,Full disclosure.
12650,I am a guy.
12651,Just putting that out there so as to not surprise anybody expecting me to be a female mom.
12652,"But I promise that I’ll try to be just as understanding and helpful, if not more."
12653,Absolutely but it may have to wait until tomorrow as I get out of work late tonight

12659,It's quite lovely in a garden.
12660,Edited: To add it makes a nice tea
12661,the picture got me in the mood to take a camping trip though
12662,"I just read about it, I’m absolutely shocked and distraught, I’m so sorry sisters."
12663,Could you elaborate?
12664,I thought this was about abortion and rape.
12665,Camping with my kid isn't allowed?
12666,Got it.
12667,I mean I know I'll never get to.
12668,But damn.
12669,I'll just go cry alone.
12670,Thanks
12671,Don’t be blinded by white privilege
12672,Because my fragile little heart was broken twice.
12673,"Once when R v W overturned, and a 2nd time when I found out its not actual camping that's going viral in the womens community."
12674,Lolol I had my smores packed up
12675,New York here!

12679,I know it is far way to go.
12680,I’m in Chicago and we are expecting to be a safe haven for camping.
12681,I went to a gathering tonight and hung out with a lot of people who support camping.

12685,I only noticed after I posted haha.
12686,"To all the ladies that need this help, we are all thinking of you, from a man that gives a damn!"
12687,"On my note I’m mostly ok, I just have a hard time connecting so it feels like losing love and a best friend."
12688,And attempts have been made in some states in Central Europe as well to limit camping.
12689,Two political parties in my country are particularly keen on making women’s lives miserable.
12690,Love noisy boys!!
12691,I have 2 of my own.
12692,Serious and important truth.
12693,Yeah the would have to meet deductible in the US.
12694,The wait times are different place to place.
12695,It was more to set the expectation that it isn’t free and there could be a wait.
12696,"Some may not know that, you’d be surprised how some think the Canadian system works."
12697,I love you too.
12698,It’s hate that brought us here.
12699,Hate and misunderstanding.
12700,Love is going to dig us out.
12701,"If it’s where I think (I live there too), it’s been a deeply red tea party run state since at least 2016."
12702,“Swing” my ass.
12703,Lepage.
12704,"It's being attacked for appropriating black culture

Edit because people seem to think I agree


On Twitter and facebook, there were people using the hashtags ""auntie network and underground railroad"" to tell people about the reddit group and some people got VERY offended, and apparently theres an organization out there already doing the same thing who is ALSO upset because they say ""we dont need to be reinvented, just helped"" 

I do not agree, and am a member of the auntie network, I'm just passing on why some people are upset about it"
12705,That's because Mexico took Irish Catholicism pushed Jesus aside and gave the mantle to the OG mom of mom's.
12706,"Our Lady of Guadalupe is probably crying tonight, but shes the ultimate symbol of safe camping."
12707,They also federally legalized same sex marriage first.
12708,It's because they actually follow separating church and state rather than just pretending to.
12709,Same!
12710,"Southern California has plenty of camping sites, and I'm happy to get you there."
12711,We need male allies as much as we need females.
12712,Thanks for being supportive.
12713,Moms come in all shapes and sizes.
12714,Awesome to know you’re here.
12715,Not all people who want to go camping identify as there biological sex.
12716,So I’m sure guys are welcome too.
12717,And lemongrass makes such a lovely tea!
12718,Lol same.
12719,I was going back and forth whether I should go camping from Wednesday to Saturday this week.
12720,"I start back to work on monday (12-16hrs, 5-6 days a week)... but decided against going to finish up a few things at home."
12721,"Reading this made me really wanna go camping... but then rereading it and understanding it, I'm down for camping but it wont be long until they take camping away from us too."
12722,"If you're American, you now have an important job."
12723,Go and fight for your sisters and moms.
12724,Vote.
12725,Donate.
12726,Volunteer.
12727,Talk to your brothers about how important this is.
12728,They’re talking about abortion in a roundabout way.
12729,They’re not talking about actual camping.
12730,"When I was in specific job training in the military, the July 4th holiday came around, giving us a three day weekend."
12731,"Our commanders said we could *not* fly home to visit our families (who we wouldn’t have seen in a year in some cases)(these were long training courses, about ten months) without taking vacation time."
12732,"Several of us let it be known we were going camping—we were stationed in Colorado, as a lovely coincidence, lots of beautiful nature, and sorry, we’ll be out of touch all weekend, because, you know, out in the woods."
12733,"(This was the early 1990s, cell access was not a thing.)"
12734,I hope you’re able to have some peaceful time with nature in good time 👍
12735,"Cali here 👋 anybody ever has the need to camp here in Cali and needs some help with the whole trip itself, I'm your gal 😉 My door is always open ❤️"
12736,New York here too.
12737,"This auntie has no car, but will
happily will pack and ship a cooler of whatever camping supplies you may need for your camping trip."
12738,Plus a box of cookies because snacks are important.
12739,Big internet hugs to you.
12740,"That's a singular feeling to have, losing a mom, and I'm sorry you are feeling it."
12741,As a mom from across the virtual plane just know I'm thinking about you and here for you if you need it!
12742,It's not the same as having her at all but we're all here for you in a tiny miniscule way.
12743,You can travel down to see the Boston science museum.
12744,I live in Europe so I had to google who that is.
12745,Do you think it’ll be illegal in more places other than Texas to help women out?
12746,"Uh, by who?"
12747,Least I can do.
12748,South-east Asia :/ but i have talked to one of my brothers about it
12749,Ahhh.
12750,Makes sense.
12751,There are a lot of people out there that would like to do actual camping but don't feel safe to go alone.
12752,"Just to clarify it isn’t my mother I lost, or anyone physically for that matter."
12753,"It was more related to a very good relationship with a beautiful smart woman that was also my best friend, but that we both had to end because sometimes life isn’t fair."
12754,Thank you so much for all your kind words though!
12755,Haha lucky!
12756,If Maine votes for Lepage we‘ll be in trouble.
12757,I’m worried about women in southern states though.
12758,There’s not much Texas can do to non-Texans for helping others go camping out of state fortunately.
12759,"It's already illegal in many other states, including Oklahoma where I live."
12760,"There were ""trigger laws"" that went into effect the minute the Supreme Court ruled."
12761,"Ohio already has a ""heartbeat bill"" in place, which had a stay put on it until this ruling was finalized."
12762,"They are now planning to reinstate the heartbeat bill in Ohio as of December 2022, and criminalize abortions here by the end of 2023."
12763,"Twitter and facebook mostly 

I dont know why im.getting downvoted, I didn't say I agreed with it I'm just saying WHY it's happening


They were using the hashtag auntie network and hash tag underground railroad to tell people about the reddit group and some people got upset 

Again, I dont agree, I'M PART OF THE AUNTIE NETWORK, I'm just saying why people are getting mad"
12764,💞 They may need protecting there too.
12765,Thanks for you support.
12766,The sentiment still stands.
12767,"Sorry you're dealing with a shake-up anyway, sounds like you have your head on straight."
12768,"Without knowing the circumstances I'm sure as rough as it is, it was the right choice."
12769,Thank you for explaining mum
12770,Thank you so much for the kind words!
12771,It is rough for sure.
12772,The thing you're never told about being an adult when your young is that you can make the best available decision and still not have it be what you want.
12773,You're 100% right.
12774,And a lot of adults never learn how to see the long view.
12775,I'm certain once your foresight has played out you'll look back and see it as the right choice.
12776,Gah I feel like I've made a couple of those decisions and they were so hard to deal with in the moment!
12777,That is definitely true in my opinion!
12778,Not only that but I will even go so far as to say many adults are never given the tools to see the long view.
12779,Its mostly a hard choice because not only do we still love each other we actually still like each other.
12780,after 6 months and 12 chemos i finished my last one!
12781,i’m not quite in the clear for being cancer free but i hopefully should be soon.

13500,You are going to be the best welder ever!
13501,And it’s a really diverse field.
13502,If you like art you can be an artist and weld masterpieces or you can make a good steady income anywhere in the world.
13503,Or you can do both!
13504,Congratulations!
13505,All I want for my kiddos is happiness and security.
13506,I'm relieved you're embarking on a career that cannot be outsourced.

13511,Well done you!
13512,"Welding stuff has always struck me as a very cool skill that would be great to learn but I almost certainly won't (hot stuff scares me), a bit like skateboarding or scuba diving."
13513,But congrats to you on learning a really useful skill.
13514,Congratulations!!
13515,It takes courage to move into fields that have been typically male dominated in the past.
13516,Keep strong!
13517,I think women can make better welders because they can be more precise and neater and have more attention to detail.
13518,My welding teacher in high school used my projects as examples of how it should be done.
13519,I enjoyed welding.
13520,Have fun!

13528,I’m so proud of you poppet!
13529,This trade is in such demand right now!!!
13530,Always wear your helmet and your gloves!
13531,Welding burn to your eyes is no joke.
13532,🎉🎉🎉
13533,You’ll love it!
13534,This is an amazing ticket into blacksmithing!
13535,"Sculpting, knowing the shape of the world around you built by welds, and being a real piece of our world!"
13536,Amazing work.
13537,I can’t imagine it was easy and neither is your path but you are walking it!
13538,"A welder, that’s amazing!"

13540,You are a good human.
13541,Thank you.
13542,"I shall hug you, also...."
13543,Why no scratches?
13544,Also make sure what you are welding does not produce a toxic gas.
13545,This is excellent advice.
13546,"I used to work as a fabricator, and plenty of those dudes did not pay that close attention to safety."
13547,"My boyfriends been working in the industry for over 20 years, and his advice to every person that he trains is always “have a healthy fear and respect for your tools.”"
13548,"So you are a sibling, here?"
13549,Cool!

13563,My ex and I owned a welding business.
13564,He had to have tiny slivers of metal removed from his eyes.
13565,It was painful to watch.
13566,"I’m not too sure tbh but I’d imagine that it’s either a weak point that’ll potentially break if something comes flying at your eye, or simply because it obscures your vision, which in field like welding/ fabrication you really want to be able to see what you doing in full detail since just about every machine you’ll be working with can easily take your fingers off"
13567,The reason to not wear eye protection that has scratches in it is because your employer is supposed to provide you with good eye pro.
13568,"If you have Z87 eye protection that *does not* have an actual hole in it, you'll be fine."
13569,The reason people get arc flash is because their irises get exposed to way more UV radiation than they should normally.

13596,"You have a talent, don’t listen to the haters ❤️"
13597,Omg!

13599,You are incredibly talented and I hope you will write a children’s book!

13644,Great job!

13646,"I always struggled with watercolor despite it being so fun, something that helped motivate me was buying myself a travel pallet, a brush that holds water, and keeping 2×4 scrap watercolor paper with me everywhere."
13647,"You'd be surprised how cool it is to see something like a landscape or sun set, sit down and actually capture it"
13648,"Sister here...

Uhh screw what mom thinks."

13654,"These are amazing, sweetheart!"
13655,"As an artist myself, i would say ignore those that are unimpressed."
13656,"Constructive criticism by those that know art is fine, but ignore the haters and naysayers."

13658,Keep making beautiful art for you!
13659,Is your mom blind or something?
13660,They look like designs I'd use in wallpaper for a nursery
13661,Dude.
13662,These are amazing!
13663,I want the panda and the bunny?
13664,wallabee?
13665,Idk what he is but he's mine and I love him..
13666,I will throw money at you and so will everyone else on Etsy.
13667,I want the wallabun painting.
13668,"I want it on tea towels, coffee cups, drapes, wallpaper."
13669,"I want to redecorate my house in adorably derpy, totally loveable panda and wallabun print."
13670,I want a hoodie.
13671,Make that two because I like hoodies and love Mr. Pandakins and Wally Wallabun-bun.
13672,"I also want to hang out with the artist because the person who can create such joyful whimsy is somebody whose perspective and take on the world is something I want to experience, learn from, and try to embrace myself."
13673,".
.
Also."
13674,I paint and I'm told I'm not too bad and have even sold a few paintings... but watercolours terrify me.
13675,Mine always get muddy and messy and I can't get what I want ever.
13676,They're delicate and you need both a lot of control/patience and the ability to just let go and let things fall where they are and I just can't do it.
13677,"All that to say... you just picked up some watercolours and came back with several beautiful, emotion-drawing, pheromone inducing, take-all-my-money inspiring love."
13678,That's a massive accomplishment!
13679,My mother always told me that my artwork was a useless hobby and I was no good at it.
13680,"She even threw away a few of my pieces and my cousin salvaged them from a dumpster, framed them, and hung them in her house and is ecstatic to have ""original"" artwork."
13681,So I know how deeply painful it is to have your pride of accomplishment torn down by the person who should be your biggest cheerleader.
13682,I'm your mom now and I want to be your first customer.
13683,"And I'll share your incredible work with the glow of pride and say, ""look what my kid created!"
13684,"Aren't they amazing?"""
13685,Because you are.
13686,Edit to add: LOOK AT THE SHADING!!!!
13687,"Oh wow, you truly truly have a wonderful eye."
13688,I'm just absolutely in love.
13689,Those are great!
13690,I would buy cards of reproductions of some of those.
13691,Looks like you'd be a good childrens book illustrator.
13692,Omg !!!!!
13693,This is the cutest thing I've seen today
13694,Your work is beautiful!
13695,"I love the animals and the ""eat your enemies"" made me giggle."
13696,Keep making art!
13697,As an artist this looks great!
13698,Keep going and don’t stop!
13699,That is so sweet!
13700,I love the panda's expression and I love how you did the bamboo with the joints being a little darker.
13701,Very nice!
13702,The bunny is just so cute.
13703,I would buy and entire box of cards with different versions of the bunny.
13704,"BTW, the others are cute too."
13705,I just love everything bunnies.
13706,"That is one bored panda, if only there were an online site that references Reddit all the time that needed to buy that."
13707,NFT collection.
13708,"As long as you're happy, I'm happy, sib."
13709,And I loooove the totoros!
13710,They're painted perfectly!
13711,Oh that’s simply lovely!
13712,"The panda bear’s 
expression is priceless."
13713,It looks like he got caught eating bamboo 😂.
13714,The bamboo looks natural and the green shades are just right.
13715,Water color is so hard!
13716,Keep going!
13717,You’re doing so great!
13718,Love the Miyazaki and other critters!
13719,You're massively better than I'd be at that!
13720,OMG!
13721,I absolutely adore them.
13722,All of them.
13723,"I would love, love, LOVE to have one of them hanging in my home, Buttercup!"
13724,Start an Etsy page.
13725,I would be honored to own one of them.
13726,So good.
13727,I am delighted by them.
13728,Wow!
13729,That’s really good!
13730,Look at your amazing eye for shading and light source!

13839,People would pay for them at Comic Cons.
13840,You may also try some of the local art shows and/or a local farmers' market.
13841,Your art makes me smile :) I love Totoro & Spirited Away!!
13842,My mum also doesn’t understand my art but that’s ok - there are others like us here who can see how hard it is to watercolour this well and can appreciate it x
13843,So cute!
13844,Ghibli is quite whimsical so it really lends itself to the style too!
13845,This is amazing!!
13846,"Aunty here, I’m very impressed!!"
13847,I love pandas!
13848,This gives me panda Totoro vibes.
13849,Edit: I didn’t realize I could scroll your others xD oops.
13850,All amazing still!
13851,!
13852,My sis and I call it “getting macaroni necklaced” when someone is seemingly underwhelmed and kicks your RSD into high gear lol 🙃 This is delightful and very well done!
13853,"-Not a mom, but a sister who can relate ♥️"
13854,I’m not a mom but these are awesome.
13855,Love the ghibli stuff.
13856,Laughed at no face.
13857,These are amazing.
13858,Literally amazing.
13859,I know how great they are because I was excited when I realized it wasn't just one pic but an entire *gallery*  of adorable fun.
13860,Please never stop.
13861,I want to read a childrens book illustrated by you some day.
13862,"Sis, these are AMAZING!"
13863,"You can open up so many doors for yourself, not only financially by sharing these with the world."
13864,I'd watch you paint live 😍
13865,Congratulations :)
13866,"Truly and genuinely, you have talent here."
13867,Please keep at it!
13868,"If you do, I have no doubt I'll see your work again someday."
13869,-Step dad for a minute.
13870,I'm not a woman and not a parent but these watercolors look awesome.
13871,"Looks like painting makes you happy, and it'll definitely make other people happy to see your art, so you should definitely go for it!"
13872,"Either as a hobby or as something ""more""."
13873,Must have panda!
13874,That is just about the cutest panda I have ever seen!
13875,It looks very Studio Ghibli and the bamboo!
13876,It is adorable and watercolor is HARD.
13877,You do have talent!
13878,I do watercolor and have never made anything this cute!!!
13879,Absolutely adorable.
13880,Keep practicing your craft :) And don't feel obligated to turn it into a side hustle.
13881,Sometimes it's best just to enjoy things for what they are and the joy they bring you.
13882,"Anyways, so proud of you and can't wait to see what you paint next!"
13883,!
13884,This mom knows for sure that you’ve got talent!
13885,"I’d love to see these in an Etsy shop, at our farmers market, at our local independent grocery store."
13886,I’d buy these as little cards!
13887,OMG!
13888,I love it so much.
13889,"I have never been able to get watercolor right, and you seem to have gotten the hang of it beautifully."
13890,Keep going!
13891,!
13892,I think they are great!
13893,"Especially the Studio Ghibli themed 😊

Keep it up!"
13894,I’m so proud of you.
13895,That panda is adorable!
13896,They're amazing.
13897,Good job.
13898,You made my day a little brighter.
13899,"Love them, especially the Totoro!"
13900,"(I wouldn't suggest you make any Disney characters, though, because Disney is notorious for suing people who copy their characters."
13901,I don't think Studio Ghibli has a problem with fan art.)
13902,I could never watercolor right.
13903,These look great!
13904,I love ghibli also so I'm a sucker
13905,"These are wonderful, love how expressive the faces are."
13906,This is giving me major Totoro vibes!
13907,I'm impressed and think you are doing a great job.
13908,Hugs from this South Australian Mum 😊
13909,Love these!
13910,You might want to give #4 to your mom ;-)
13911,"The Eat Your Enemies one would be framed and on my wall the minute I saw it, I would have thrown money at you and bragged about how my child was able to make such wonderful art!"
13912,"The talent you have shown makes me smile, knowing you put your heart into these pieces."
13913,It shows.
13914,"Also, love Totoro and would have it beside my bed as well."
13915,Amazing artwork!
13916,I want to buy all of these.
13917,I want to start watercolouring!
13918,I even bought all the supplies but it's been sitting in my art basket for over a year.
13919,"Damn you, adhd."
13920,Your post just inspired me to take out my paints and try to paint something TODAY 💜💜 The paintings you did are so lovely and they made me happy 😊
13921,Oh my god.
13922,"Just gonna say this really quick, I’m jealous of your dedication and ability to do these."
13923,I wish I had the same for my art.
13924,"Also, THESE ARE SO GOOD."
13925,"Like I’d buy any of these from you, especially if you did one of something I love."
13926,But just in general I would because they look so good.
13927,I’m so proud of you and hope you keep it up.
13928,"If you ever open a shop or commissions, please PM me or something so I can get one."
13929,You’re doing so great!
13930,"BTW, your real mom is a party pooper"
13931,"Big sis or little sis here, just wanted to say I love the watercolor works."
13932,"♡ Especially Totoro and No Face, you captured them splendidly."
13933,"Don't let real Mom get to you, hun, you found your calling and that's all that matters, especially if painting makes YOU happy."
13934,"Keep doing what makes you happy, don't let the haters or bullies get to you."
13935,"Oh my goodness, those animals are so relatable!"
13936,"Oh wow, these are genuinely gorgeous and so well done!"
13937,"You’re so talented and your Mom is, in my eyes, an absolute idiot if she doesn’t see it!"
13938,"I’m proud of you, your art is beautiful!"
13939,"PS… I would totally buy a print of the one of Totoro, Chibi and the Soot Sprite!"
13940,!
13941,Pandas are my favourite animal and it is absolutely adorable.
13942,Are you selling these?
13943,I’d love to buy a print if you are.
13944,"Oh, I love these!"
13945,The panda has so much personality!
13946,Another request for an update when you open an Etsy shop--or maybe Redbubble?
13947,Do you take requests?
13948,"Honey, please listen to mama and make an Etsy shop!"
13949,Some of these are perfect for nursery decorations and in general they’re all awesome.
13950,I’m so proud of you ♥️
13951,aaahw those made me smile.
13952,the last one is so endearing.
13953,I personally love watercolouring that borders on the abstract and I'd be stoked if someone gave me this card.
13954,Wow!
13955,"I saw the panda & thought “That looks like Totoro!” Then went to the next, and it WAS Totoro!"
13956,Your “No Face” is fantastic— I could see that on a tee shirt.
13957,"As a matter of fact, there’s a company that takes fan art & makes tee shirts & the artist gets a cut of the sales."
13958,It’s called Tee fury.
13959,May I suggest that you look into it?
13960,THIS mom would love to buy that tee (I will see it if you go in that direction.
13961,I am on their daily e-mail list!).
13962,Good luck with your art!🍀🦋🍀
13963,"I’ve been an artist for my whole life, and while I agree with my esteemed mom colleagues here that I would never discourage you, neither would I tell you to keep doing something I didn’t think showed promise."
13964,"(That is, I would say something VERY nice— but I probably wouldn’t say what I’m about to say.)"
13965,Well done you.
13966,"I do believe everyone has creativity, but your art clearly displays talent — and most of all, skill."
13967,"Idk if you’ve had any training (I’m self-taught, but BOY have I learned the value of the “taught” part over time!)"
13968,"Your composition is very good; that’s difficult to teach, and good that you have a natural ability."
13969,"Your brushwork is also v good, and what you, me and the other watercolorist know (that many don’t) is that watercolor, while popular, is probably the most DIFFICULT medium to paint in."
13970,"(Ever wonder why all the masters worked in OIL, despite how much it cost?"
13971,"Yep, it’s EASIER."
13972,Like electric guitars are easier to play than acoustic.
13973,"Oh, snap, I’m letting ALL the secrets out, lol)

Allow me to introduce you to Scott Christian Sava, whose YouTube channel will bring joy to your heart."
13974,"He is on a mission to make art fun — and possible — to everyone, and his lessons are free."
13975,"From there, YouTube’s algorithm will fetch you up lots of other learning channels — and I can’t wait to see the joyful brushstrokes you come up with next!"
13976,The magic you found in creating these fantastic paintings is the same magic that will carry you through decades of gaining more skills.
13977,We only know famous artists because they worked on their craft without giving up.
13978,"And as parents, we don't always know what to say or how to say it."
13979,"Sorry that your IRL mom hasn't seen your progress yet, but it's there and will only get more amazing if you keep at it!"
13980,!
13981,"This is incredible, and I would personally purchase a picture like these if I saw it on sale."
13982,You definitely have talent!
13983,"Fuckn love this, kid."
13984,Wow!!
13985,"🤩 Kiddo, you have some real talent ."
13986,Too bad your birth mom doesn’t see it.
13987,"Please keep at it and post some updates for us “moms.”  

I would frame these and hang them up in the living room as a start to the new gallery wall we would make for displaying your work."
13988,These are amazing!
13989,Keep it up
13990,"I may not be a mom, or a sister for that matter."
13991,But am a brother though!
13992,That looks very beautiful and nice big sis!
13993,You are amazing at this!
13994,I am so impressed.
13995,I love your Studio Ghibli pieces.
13996,I can see it inspires you.
13997,"Never stop, you have talent and it will one get better."
13998,Proud of you.
13999,"Looks awesome, I love the expression of the first one!"
14000,It's enough to find something you love.
14001,It doesn't have to be a calling
14002,Wow!
14003,I’ve been a painter for quite some time now and I still can’t do watercolor shading like you have done!
14004,Keep up the great work hun ❤️

14024,"Sibling here, but if you ever want to sell these, theyll be a huge hit at conventions!!"
14025,"They came out really good, proud of you!"
14026,Your animals belong in a childrens story.
14027,Go write a childrens story and then paint the pictures for it.
14028,It’s beautiful.
14029,Then you could make prints of them too for people to hang up in their nurseries and playrooms.
14030,And prints for clothing.
14031,These are dope.
14032,Great work!
14033,I love these so much I got a bubble of happy - amazing job lovely you are phenomenal

14081,!
14082,That is a really cute panda.
14083,Great job it looks amazing.
14084,You have never had much practice?
14085,"I work as a creative and used to draw a lot, my starting work was nowhere near your skill level."
14086,"You have a natural talent, please don't give up!"
14087,"And if your mum pushes back, just remember that you can make a career out of this that pays well."
14088,"I know plenty of illustration artists that do it for a living, and there is design too which is even easier to find jobs in."
14089,"Btw, I love that you drew Gibli."
14090,Totoro and Spirited away are such amazing movies!

14107,I especially love the squirrel and the flowers but all of them are really cute and made me smile.

14131,These are ridiculously good!!!!!!
14132,!
14133,They’re great.
14134,I can imagine them as illustrations in a childrens book
14135,These are super adorable and awesome!
14136,If you start taking requests I would like a red panda standing with his arms in the air (they do this to be indimidating but it makes them more adorable) and I will pay you monies for it!!!
14137,ily!
14138,Where’s my extra picture frames at?

14140,These look fantastic :)

14143,You should look up his stuff!
14144,These look amazing!
14145,Good job.
14146,"There's a secret to animation where some draw and others have a special touch where they bring something to life, where a still becomes suddenly alive with feeling, emotion and personality."
14147,A little world captured.

14149,Hope it take you further positively in life!
14150,Are you sure you just started?
14151,Because these are awesome and quite good!
14152,I could see these being framed and hung or even having prints made into little greeting cards you find in those cute little tourist shops.
14153,I would TOTALLY buy some of them!
14154,No Face would definitely end up on the wall in my office!
14155,😍
14156,I would frame that and hang it in my home.
14157,"Great job, kiddo."
14158,These are wonderful!
14159,I love your style!
14160,I definitely think you have talent.
14161,I’m so sorry your mom isn’t supportive.
14162,The job of any parent is to support their child in what makes them happy.
14163,It is a shame she isn’t doing that.
14164,"If painting makes you happy, you should continue."
14165,"If you can make some money at it, even better."
14166,Keep it up!
14167,You are amazing.
14168,Lol “eat your enemies” 😂🤣🤣 you have a real talent and I think you could be an illustrator for sure!
14169,"Oh, these are fantastic!"
14170,"I don't thing I've tried watercolouring since I was in school, but I've always wanted to."
14171,"I think maybe this is just the inspiration I needed, thank you very much❤️ Keep it up, they're beautiful!"
14172,They are so adorable!
14173,I see them as perfect style for illustrating a child’s book.
14174,Each picture has a lot of personality and a unique style.
14175,"In the end, it’s really about how much you love doing it."
14176,"If you are happy with the result and it makes you happy, keep at it."
14177,Remember Van Gogh was only famous post Morten.
14178,"His style was so different, people didn’t appreciate it."
14179,His brother paid for his supplies.
14180,What a work of art!
14181,Well done.
14182,You should be proud of yourself
14183,"Other than the 4th one, which is still very well done, I would pay to hang those in my child’s nursery."
14184,Seriously.
14185,Keep it up!!
14186,!
14187,I don’t know if your interested… but I’ll buy a watercolor piece from you!
14188,They are adorable!
14189,"Maybe you can do something cute for my girls room

Ps.. mom is so proud."
14190,My daughter is a gifted artist as well and I’m so excited to see her not go to typical “corporate route“… Follow your dreams.
14191,I would 💯 frame and hang these in my house.
14192,Keep going!
14193,Oh my goodness!
14194,These would absolutely sell.
14195,They're so stinkin' adorable!!
14196,They would make great nursery decor or cards (as others have said).
14197,You should also post in the art subreddits.
14198,You've got a delightful style and fantastic natural talent.
14199,Go you!
14200,Oh my ducking these are INCREDIBLE!!!

14224,Reminds me of Studio Ghilbi.
14225,Beautiful.
14226,"Full disclosure, not a mom."
14227,Just a daughter.
14228,Those are amazing!
14229,"Keep painting, don’t stop."
14230,"Oh my god, it’s adorable!"
14231,Those are so sweet.
14232,I love the looks on their faces.
14233,Dude as a professional digital artist who can't paint in real life to save his life...I'm jealous.
14234,These are AMAZING!!
14235,I love water colors and the looks they give and the stuff you've drawn with them is just beautiful and oddly peaceful!
14236,I'm sorry your mom doesn't see it.
14237,Sucks to be her.
14238,"Keep doing this, man!"
14239,You're an Artist.
14240,I hope you don't let self doubt bring you down or stop you!
14241,Good shit.
14242,Keep it up!
14243,I love it!
14244,"Honey, I could see tons of people wanting these at art fairs or farmers markets."

14286,I love these.
14287,Amazing job.
14288,Keep up your passion.

14296,This is your calling!
14297,THATS SO ADORABLE AWWW
14298,These are fantastic!
14299,"I love the way you got the watercolor to flow, making darker shadows and giving depth to your painting."
14300,The amount of detail is just enough.
14301,I really like your style.
14302,♥️
14303,That is so adorable!
14304,That could definitely be a greeting card.
14305,You should start giving some to your friends.
14306,P.S.
14307,I have a degree in fine art.
14308,"🙂 

Love,

Mom"
14309,I would buy the panda!
14310,"Whimsical and absolutely stunning, especially for a first effort!"
14311,I think your bio-mom doesn’t get the artistic process.
14312,"Like, at all."
14313,Art is so personal and uniquely *us*.
14314,"If your bio-mom can’t get behind seeing a small bit of their child’s soul, I am genuinely sorry for them."
14315,"But I can, and I love that you took the risk to share it."
14316,"Your art is amazing, just like you are!"
14317,❤️
14318,"Not a mom here, just some random dude who came across this on the front page but 1/5 is just awesome, they all are but it just makes me so happy when I look at it haha, wonderful job!"
14319,Can’t wait to see more
14320,"Aww, these are so cute!"

14327,Way to go!
14328,"They're beautiful, Sweetheart!"
14329,That's excellent!
14330,I'd frame that and hang it on my wall.
14331,"Keep going, you have real talent!"
14332,I would buy any of these.
14333,If I was your mom I’d like to have you send me one as a card.
14334,These are amazing and would all be displayed proudly on my fridge.
14335,These are amazing!
14336,"I think you could make some serious $$$ by selling your work, if that's something you're interested in."
14337,These are so cute!
14338,Enjoy playing around with it and learning all sorts of nifty artistic tricks.
14339,"I am in LOVE with the chubby koala the most, that face is a whole mood."
14340,This looks great sweetie!
14341,Keep at it and keep those pictures coming!
14342,I'm excited to see what you create next 😊

14346,This mom's proud of you.
14347,"I love the textures, colours, shading, and of course, the perfect characters!"
14348,"I could see the last one on shirts, postcards and cards!"
14349,"I can see the attention to detail, and the passion."
14350,Please keep it up!
14351,You could be a children's book illustrator!
14352,There's even a sub for that!
14353,They are all fantastic but I would DIE for that panda
14354,I love these and would frame them all to be hung up.
14355,"This is legitimately adorable, the style is really unique."
14356,"I'm getting like Miyazaki vibes from it fr, keep painting!!!"
14357,Your mother must be blind
14358,It's so cuteeeee.
14359,"I love Totoro, keep working!"

14375,"Oh my god, they're so cute and pretty!"
14376,"The animals remind me of WinterTommy's panda plushie, aptly named Mr. Panda"
14377,Those are amazing!
14378,You could sell those they’re brilliant.
14379,You’ve definitely found your calling!

14382,💕

14384,!
14385,OMG STUDIO GHIBLI ITS SO CUTE
14386,Is adorable!
14387,They're very good.
14388,You could sell them at a con or on Tumblr/Twitter/insta
14389,"All of these are beautiful, my dear!!!"
14390,I can't pick a favorite.
14391,"Please keep doing this, your joy in creating them really shines through."
14392,That is adorable!!
14393,Keep on doing what makes you happy!
14394,It looks like it should be in a published book.
14395,😊😊
14396,As your internet mom let me tell you I am very impressed.
14397,I think this painting is absolutely awesome.
14398,I have always wished I could paint!
14399,I have no aptitude for it whatsoever.
14400,"My brain doesn’t work that way, so when I tell you this is great, I mean it!"
14401,Proud of you!
14402,Watercolors are super difficult to control - these are all so pretty!
14403,Great job; especially love the Ghibli art 💖 keep it up!
14404,!
14405,These are absolutely amazing!
14406,"I’ve always loved watercolors, but they’re tricky to get right and you’re already doing so well!!"
14407,"If this is something you’re passionate about, keep pursuing it 💕"
14408,Looks like Winnie the Pooh.
14409,Panda Pooh.
14410,You are so talented!
14411,"Keep working hard, and you’ll be amazed at how that talent will grow."
14412,I LOVE the flowers and bee!
14413,"You are very talented, sunshine, and should be very proud!"
14414,!❤️
14415,It’s beautiful!
14416,Omg it's panda totoro!!!
14417,So cute!
14418,😍
14419,Omg those are beautiful!
14420,I'd be very proud to put them on my refrigerator!
14421,I can't wait to see what else you create!
14422,Awww so cute!
14423,These are amazing!
14424,You honestly have talent and I really hope you stick with it.
14425,I can't wait to see what you can do next and how much you grow as an artist.
14426,Are you kidding me???
14427,These are perfect!
14428,I would 110% commission work from you.
14429,These are amazing.
14430,"They are so cute and unique, each with their own personality."
14431,Great job!
14432,If you were my kid I'd proudly display these on the wall framed!
14433,But not before I tell you how cute and talented you are!
14434,Honey!
14435,You did a great job!
14436,I'm so proud of you.
14437,These are absolutely charming.
14438,Keep it up!
14439,Reminds me of the “Everyone else has had more sex than me” bunny
14440,Hard agree.
14441,Can you come up with some sweet way of mentally flipping  her words and transforming them into clean fuel for your success?
14442,Maybe get a mirror and say the words and see the reverse... Or write them down and then burn them and see the smoke go into the universe and change into decent words... Or... Or.
14443,Your art gave me emotions.
14444,That is good art.
14445,Keep going.
14446,Keep going.
14447,"Shine your light, my love."
14448,It's takes away the darkness.
14449,I'll look into it!
14450,Shoot me a message!
14451,😊
14452,Do you need rights for totoro and spirited away to put those images on a card and selling them?
14453,I'm just wondering!
14454,Same here!
14455,Thanks!
14456,I've only been at it 3 weeks!
14457,❤️
14458,I've done a few more since I posted this including some final fantasy.
14459,Thank you!!!!
14460,!
14461,Thank you!!!!
14462,They are card sized!
14463,😊
14464,Thank you!
14465,I've only been at it 3 weeks 😊
14466,I'm going to look into that if you wanna shoot me a message!
14467,😊
14468,"I'm going to be looking into that this week, feel free to shoot me a message and I'll update you"
14469,Oh god I haven’t thought about that bunny in years.
14470,Update us once you've got your Etsy store set up :D
14471,I definitely want a copy of Totoro!
14472,"You should be super proud of these ❤️ 
Might I suggest From Up On Poppy Hill, next?"
14473,I would love the eat your enemies no face one!
14474,Keep us updated :)
14475,"You know I have no idea, probably, but my tired brain just thought they were cute animals."
14476,"I do remember thinking the “bunny” looked familiar, lol."
14477,"Never watched spirited away, so I assumed I’d missed something there."
14478,My son is autistic and so I can identify transformers and not much else.
14479,I have clearly missed out.
14480,Ha ha!
14481,When I first posted I just thought it was the panda one.
14482,It was so cute I had to say something then I realized there were more!
14483,Totoro is awesome!
14484,You have a great talent.
14485,I am really impressed by all of them.
14486,3 weeks?!
14487,Awesome!!
14488,Keep going!
14489,"Also, you seem to have a knack for cute faces!"
14490,It’s so adorably Ghibli!
14491,Came here to say this!
14492,I love that one!
14493,I was thinking of the Baron from Whisper of the Heart and the cat returns next possibly.
14494,With the baroness dancing.... but I may be biting off more than I can chew with that one!
14495,Or maybe ponyo.
14496,I really wanna do something from Only Yesterday since its my fave though.
14497,Definitely send me a message about a print though ❤️
14498,The guy eating noodles or whatever is from Spirited Away!
14499,"I second this… I mean, I third this!"
14500,I'm with the others on the idea of an Etsy store.
14501,"My first thought was ""OMG that's so cute!"""
14502,when I saw the panda.
14503,But I need the Totoro.
14504,My local comic expo (and I live in a decent sized city) always has multiple booths of random people selling their anime based arts.
14505,I paid $20 a pop for a Totoro and a Supernatural chibi picture made of those oil crayon things.
14506,And that shop had a line at all times every time I passed them.
14507,You could totally do something like this.
14508,Maybe!
14509,"I've just done some moogles, inuyasha, and red xiii."
14510,I do like my anime n gaming!
14511,❤️ message me if you want about a print of totoro 😊
14512,Not just teen girls.
14513,All women.
14514,I’ve had girls come up to me and act like we were best friends when we were complete strangers just so they weren’t alone w a creepy dude bugging them.
14515,I caught on immediately every time.
14516,This is a great tactic ladies pls don’t be afraid to use it.
14517,Years ago I was the one who had to run up to a strange woman in JC Penny's for this very reason...'mom' totally had my back!
14518,I love the fact that I am now the 'mom' and can pay that kindness forward.
14519,"This is true for all 'sisters' and 'friends' as well...reach out for help, we're here."
14520,I love this!
14521,"I remember a piece of advice I'd heard as a young mom and told my kids and their friends: If you're in a store/playground/park/etc and you feel endangered, don't yell ""Help!"""
14522,"Yell ""Help, MOM!"""
14523,You'll have tons of heads turned to save you.
14524,"Tbh, I don't care if you're a man, a woman, or neither."
14525,Or how old you are.
14526,"Call me mom, say you need help, I'll happily look young for my age and intercede on your behalf."
14527,"People who harass in public spaces because they figure ""politeness"" will protect them from being called out should definitely learn about fed up rude bitches like me."
14528,And I may be a little over excited to teach.
14529,"The other ""trick"" I learned while driving alone at night and discovering that you're being followed."
14530,Pull into a Fire station and start honking your horn.
14531,Those guys don't want anyone blocking their driveway!
14532,I did this when I was 14 except I called them aunt and uncle and I pointed to the man following me.
14533,They stared at him and he walked in the other direction.
14534,They walked me most of the way home when I felt safe.
14535,[removed]
14536,"Or boys, for that matter."
14537,"Any minor, I will protect as best I can."
14538,Mama Bear at the ready!
14539,Not just teen girls... 28yo and also like a month ago I was in a situation where I also walked to the closest people I saw smoking outside a restaurant and I just casually asked if I can stand there because of the scene before (they saw).
14540,They were actually the owners and let me sit inside until my bus arrived.
14541,Seriously bless them.
14542,"To all older women: if you see a young girl being hassled, walk up to her and say loudly ""Is that guy bothering you?"
14543,"Do you want me to walk along with you?"""
14544,"Be there for them, even if no one was there for you."
14545,This is so true!
14546,"I've used it as an adult, too, approaching strange women like we were friends who happened to have split up unexpectedly."
14547,It worked: the car of men that had been pacing me for blocks drove away.
14548,There's strength in numbers and witnesses.
14549,"I'm 21, earlier this year I had these two middle schoolers come up to me and act like I was their sister to protect themselves from their bullies and I happily stayed with them, their bullies left, but I still stayed with them until their parents came"
14550,I taught all 3 of my boys to act like they know you if you look like you're in an uncomfortable situation.
14551,They've done it with guys and girls.
14552,I met one of my friends in 6th grade doing it.
14553,"And, Sweetie, just know ALL MY FRIENDS will want the story about how I went ape-shit protecting you."
14554,"I will be a legend, so you’re actually doing me a favor by enlisting my help."
14555,I will help.
14556,He will be sorry.
14557,We will both get a good laugh about how crazy I am.
14558,I’ll gladly be a big sister for any of you ❤️
14559,"I'm a 5'5 19 year old guy, but a friend pretended to be my girlfriend once a few years ago for that exact same reason."
14560,"If any stranger approaches me calling me a family member and they need that kind of help, being smol won't stop me, I WILL be ready to throw hands if needed"
14561,I'm in!
14562,Come up and hide behind me while I hit that pervert with my cane!
14563,Wonderful idea.
14564,I will share.
14565,"Another tip used in my 20s—if someone attacks you or gets close to that, fake that you are having a seizure….scares them."
14566,Carol Burnette used that tip and talked about it on the Tonight Show.
14567,I remembered and it likely saved me!
14568,Yes!
14569,Please!
14570,I'm 56 and look like your mum.
14571,I'll be your mum!
14572,Or your aunt!
14573,Anyone really.
14574,Someone bothering you?
14575,Come to me.
14576,I'll be your sis/cousin/friend/gf whatever you need.
14577,I also give an amazing death glare.
14578,"If I notice, I will also come to you and act like I know you."
14579,I've been in those shoes and no one came to help.
14580,It's the least I can do.
14581,I will be loud and obnoxious or quiet and threatening.
14582,We all have to stick together.
14583,I was driving past a teenage couple and saw the POS bf push her to the ground and start berating her as I passed.
14584,I whipped the fastest U-turn my car has ever seen and pulled right up to them just as she was getting up.
14585,I rolled down my window to ask her if she needed a ride home and he walked away so fast he couldn’t maintain his fake kewl kid limp.
14586,She was right outside her house and didn’t need a ride but I tried my best to impart as much wisdom about the life road she was headed down with this kid as I could (TL;DR- that way lies tragedy).
14587,I hope she heard me.
14588,I still think about her quite a bit.
14589,I'm turning 40 this year (cant have kids) and I would be honored to be your mom if you need one.
14590,My resolution for hitting 40 is to be less polite to creeps and tell more of them to fuck off.
14591,"It’s what I tell my kids to do if they are in public and don’t feel safe, or if they are separated from me."
14592,Look for the mom.
14593,The mom will help you.
14594,Lovely sentiment but very hard as a person of colour trying to find exactly who is believable as a mom/family figure in public.
14595,"Small things like this that we don't recognise make these situations harder, but aunty/friend/teacher usually helps here!"
14596,!
14597,Absolutely!
14598,Any woman I will gladly help with this.
14599,Ideally thats how the older woman responds.
14600,Lets not pretend all women help each other all the time
14601,"If someone does get ahold of you, make yourself as ""undesirable"" as possible."
14602,"Pee and shit yourself if you can, bite into your skin to make you bleed."
14603,All that combined with fighting back and suddenly you are no longer a desirable target.
14604,"While for some you fighting back is enough to change their mind, the ones who will still hold out might be put off enough at the idea of you now being covered in pee, shit and blood."
14605,"It might sound embarrassing, but if it stops you from being raped or taken to another location or being killed, do it."
14606,Your life is more important than pride.
14607,I don’t have a Mom and just found this sub.
14608,I can’t stop crying.
14609,I must stop reading for the night.
14610,Im a guy and I live in a relatively smaller area but still decent size and I had a girl come up to me acting like I was her brother and we were walking to the movies and sure enough there was a really creepy looking dude following her when he saw us he just walked by and I stayed with her till we saw him get in his car which was parked nearby and drive away and he was heading down the street leaving town so for what it’s worth ladies I’ll pretend to be someone you know to get a creep/asshole off your back and please be safe out there
14611,"This is good, but be aware women can be sex traffickers."
14612,Women aren't just automatically safe.
14613,Watch out for everyone.
14614,My ex had this set up with the young girls at his work when he worked part time fast food.
14615,"He said that if any of the guys started creeping on them, just call out 'DAD!'"
14616,and he would come running.
14617,He had to do that quite a few times telling them to 'stop hitting on my daughter!'
14618,"One guy did this a few times and after the third time he got the message 'they are all my daughters, SO BACK OFF!'"
14619,The girls working there loved him for that.
14620,"Men, you can ask us, too."
14621,"I know you get abused too, so please don't think that I think you can't."
14622,"That said  


ALL woman should do this."
14623,"If you're over 50, find your ""daughter""."
14624,"If someone is carrying a child, they are another good option."
14625,"Another great option ..

&#x200B;

# IF you you see a man in a turban, this man will do everything in his power to help you."
14626,Shiks wear turbans FOR OUR BENEIFT.
14627,The turban tells you this person is a Shik.
14628,Their religion is BASED around helping others.
14629,Its what they love to do.
14630,They will do \*\*EVERYTHING\*\* they can think of.
14631,"They will walk you home, speak to the man, physically place themselves between you and the threat, bring you to their home or temple, ect."
14632,"Also, these men (and woman who dont wear turbans) will feed you if you are ever hungry."
14633,Just ask anyone with a turban about a meal.
14634,They will take you to their temple and give you vegetarian meal usually consisting of a bean or lentil type dish and a grain.
14635,"They will feed yu langar, as they call it, every day for as long as you need."
14636,I’ve got my ccw and routinely carry.
14637,I guaran-damn-tee I will protect you like you were actually my own child.
14638,"I wish I could flip this and apply it to Dad, too, but a lot of us are creepy dudes."
14639,"If you know and trust a man, but are afraid he’d be put off if you dadded him like above, he wouldn’t."
14640,"He’d play along and later, cry in private, so touched he was trusted with your safety, he’d be ashamed to show it."
14641,…but only the ones you know and trust.
14642,that moment when an asian walks up to an african american woman and calls her mom
14643,"Kiddo, I promise I will listen."
14644,"I will play mom, sister, aunt, girlfriend, friend, whatever you need."
14645,I will put myself between you and the creep.
14646,I will glare daggers at whoever is creeping on you.
14647,"I promise I will ball my fists, widen my stance and my shoulders, look like a crazy mama ready to protect."
14648,I will whip up my phone and photograph the creep.
14649,"I will use my best teacher voice, low pitched, loud and clear, ask them “Is there a problem here?” I will alert staff, mall cop, waiters, anyone, I will alert by-passers if needed."
14650,I will make *sure* you are safe.
14651,I will make *sure* you’re alright.
14652,"I will walk you home, I will call anyone for you."
14653,"I will have your back, kid, whoever you are, girl, boy, nb, anytime, anywhere."
14654,"I promise, kiddo."

14656,This also works with bullies.
14657,Did it when I was 13.
14658,Worked perfectly.
14659,Watch my old ass X go off.
14660,We live for that shit.
14661,"I will help you, you help me by letting me go off on someone that deserves it."
14662,We have a lot of unexpressed rage and it is delightful to use it for good.
14663,💯
14664,Ive done this as a child and it worked!
14665,Yes.
14666,This is so true.
14667,I would absolutely intervene.
14668,I have 3 young daughters & I think about this all the time
14669,In a heartbeat!
14670,Thank you.
14671,"I’ve never been in a situation like this and I hope I never will, but if it does happen, I’ll do this."
14672,"As a teen, that works for me as well, thank you."
14673,Don’t start that with “DAD” unless violence is probable
14674,I'm in.
14675,"I'll be mom, sister, cousin, daughter, boss, teacher, whatever is needed, for whoever is needed."
14676,Always.
14677,"I saw a mega thread of this same idea of tweet on Instagram, very heartwarming."
14678,I'm always the sister out auntie who keeps an eye out for the loaner and steps in when needed.
14679,There have been three times when I've gone up to a girl and acted like besties to help them shake off a weirdo.
14680,"Give the girl a hug,  whisper ask if she's ok, and then tell the creep he can leave."
14681,There was one time a girl was arguing with a guy so I went up and did the bestie hug.
14682,Turns out she was totally OK and it was just her boyfriend and her being silly.
14683,But she thanked me for looking out for her anyways.
14684,"Life's hard,  keep an eye out for each other!"
14685,"I've used this tactic and I have gone and put myself in as a ""bestie"" when a guy wasn't leaving a woman alone."
14686,"Everytime this tactic is used, the woman has been totally understanding and have mentioned they would do or have done the same."
14687,"I’ve swooped in and pretended to be the bestie to a woman who was visibly, intensely uncomfortable with the man talking to her."
14688,Works both ways!
14689,I've gotten between guys that are fighting.
14690,I did it this weekend.
14691,"I’m a mid 30s mom, was pushing my kid in a stroller when a creeper followed us."
14692,This.
14693,Please don’t be afraid to reach out.
14694,It could save your life.
14695,"Is a loud unhappy ""mom!"""
14696,Like our sleeper cell trigger word?
14697,Because I think it may be.
14698,I’m not even a mom and that would get me going lol
14699,"When my kids were little, I told them that if they ever got separated/lost, to find a mom."
14700,"My second child got separated from us at Disneyworld, and after a few very long, horrifying minutes, I found him with a mom, grandma, and kids."
14701,"Wonderful women, and I am forever grateful for them for looking out for my son for those minutes."
14702,❤❤❤❤❤ Warrior recognizes warrior!
14703,I'm a sucker for little old men and ladies and I'll take your groceries to the trunk and tell your shitty grandkids to have respect.
14704,I also wear the secret safety pin on most of my clothing.
14705,Don't piss off a Russian tiger.
14706,"A couple weeks ago, a guy followed me for miles so I called the cops and told them I was going to come to the police station."
14707,This man was so focused on me he followed me into the lot and didn't even realize he was at a police station.
14708,The cop waiting for me was baffled.
14709,"He goes, ""Did he really just follow you into a police station?"
14710,"What s dumbass."""
14711,That shit was so stupid it was funny.
14712,Oh yes.
14713,It’s much better to be killed in a parking lot than tortured for a month before you’re killed.
14714,"Sounds gruesome, but it’s true."
14715,"And you’re not likely to be killed in the parking lot, it’s too public."
14716,Do not let yourself be taken.
14717,"If you need to, just sit in the ground."
14718,Do not go with anyone!
14719,"My mother told me when I hit puberty, that she would prefer I get shot in the first location, than end up raped, tortured and potentially held prisoner or sold into sex trafficking for the rest of my life after being moved to the second location."
14720,Better to scream and die.
14721,Right.
14722,"And if I may add a little more, parents, please teach your kids - both girls and boys/big and small - how to recognize the signals and how to safely be the “stranger friend.” It wasn’t until I saw someone post something similar (but from the other perspective) that I even considered it was something I hadn’t talked to my son about."
14723,There really is more safety in numbers.
14724,Thank you for that.
14725,We worry about our girls.
14726,But our boys should not be forgotten.
14727,"Right and we Mama Bears are
everywhere."
14728,"Don’t be afraid 
to reach out for help."
14729,Thanks for the award!!
14730,!
14731,"Have done this, but not that ""out there"" about it."
14732,I faked knowing her and sat down next to her.
14733,Stared at the guy.
14734,"He left, muttering."
14735,Not smol.
14736,You got more piss and vinegar than my 20 pound cat.
14737,Thank you for being you!
14738,Omg I love Carol Burnett.
14739,Queen 👑
14740,Friends?!
14741,I'm also undercover sassy.
14742,I'm quiet and tiny but if it comes to it I can throw two large guys under a bus with my mouth and have the bartender and security buy me drinks.
14743,Do not mess with an angry Russian.
14744,I volunteer at the legion and an old ex cop gifted me a pink taser.
14745,We don't agree on most things but he knew if his grandaunter was in trouble I'd take the f out of anyone for her or any other girl.
14746,"Never used it, but it's tested once a month for battery."
14747,My dad said don't tell anybody you have a knife when I was ten.
14748,I asked what knife.
14749,Hands me a knife.
14750,He lived throughout Holocaust and 1950s new your city.
14751,Can't deny that advice.
14752,I took it a bit over with couch sword and chair knife.
14753,But I feel safe knowing every room has hidden stabby things.
14754,And my truck.
14755,And my purse.
14756,And I taped one to a barstool.
14757,This is what I was always taught.
14758,"If you get lost, you can approach shop workers, police or mums."
14759,I never really understood the mum one until I became older.
14760,You bring up a great point.
14761,My response would be that you're my step daughter.
14762,My friend Steph just calls everyone her daughter or sister (son and brother too) No one questions that.
14763,She's amazing.
14764,"My favorite was when we were hanging out and she grabbed our Korean friend and was like, my son is here!"
14765,"And she's halfrican (her words, not mine)."
14766,The most mom I've ever met.
14767,Only I surpass her in purse snacks.
14768,(Because I carry cat and dog treats too).
14769,My family has all colors and kinds.
14770,My bff is total 6f and adopted two beautiful black kids (foster to adopt).
14771,I took in all kinds of kids too.
14772,Just call me Auntie if Mom doesn't feel right.
14773,Aunties will beat the tar out of skeezy people.
14774,This is true.
14775,I used to go for groceries at 1-2am after my work shift.
14776,I had a man follow me through the check out.
14777,He was following me to my car.
14778,"I walked up to a group of 3 mid 20s (my age at the time) I told them ""please let me stand here, I don't know this man and he's following me!"""
14779,"They looked at each other, got in their car and locked the door and drove off."
14780,I made it to my car.
14781,But I'll never forget those assholes.
14782,"But we should, we're stronger together"
14783,This.
14784,Act crazy as you can.
14785,"Don’t just scream, Help or Fire."
14786,Scream whatever you can think of.
14787,Be annoying and obvious.
14788,"I can't remember which bad guy, but a girl got out of being raped because she said she had AIDS."
14789,Core move on her.
14790,She survived.
14791,Also yelling fire is a thing.
14792,Now you have a bunch of moms.
14793,"We hope you are doing well, had dinner, and sleep enough."
14794,"Also, it's always okay to ask for help."
14795,Group mom hug.
14796,Embarrassing you in front of school or work.
14797,It's our job.
14798,Did you eat enough today?
14799,Drank enough water?
14800,Did your self care?
14801,Get a good night's sleep and sweet dreams honey.
14802,"Remember, your Mommas love you!"
14803,Mama Ace
14804,You have mom sauce!
14805,Hugs!
14806,"My friend took me outside to smoke at a bar and said a guy was being handsy and I put myself between them and said, something sinister and he left."
14807,He was the bartenders son in law.
14808,He avoids me like the plague.
14809,Small Town.
14810,Only one bar.
14811,"I can't remember, but it was like get your filthy paws off other drawers or I'll f you up like Percocet and then some."
14812,It wasn't a creepy stranger that was the first person to rape me :(
14813,My bf thought it was weird when I was staring down this guy that approached a woman on the breach.
14814,"Ransome dude asked her if she was about to leave, and she said, nah, I'm just chilling with my friends over there and waved towards us."
14815,He saw me staring him down and walked off.
14816,"Normally I wouldnt pay too much attention, but the guy peeled off from a group and was very visibly out of it (definitely at least drunk, maybe just high on something legal or something illegal)."
14817,Same I remember back in high school I was a sophomore and these two dudes junior or senior were fighting and there was a crowd around them watching and recording.
14818,I wanted to know what was happening so I snuck my way to the front of the crowd and after I saw it was a fight and after the confusion of why no one else was doing anything about.
14819,I walked up to one of the guys who I didn't know but I recognized as his class was next to mine and grabbed the back of his shirt trying to pull him away while telling him that it wasn't worth the trouble and to cut it out.
14820,Another guy noticed me doing this and started pulling the other guy away and together we broke up the fight barely a minute before a staff member walked by.
14821,"I had a situation where, a good 5 years after I finished breastfeeding my oldest, I heard a newborn baby cry, and my boobs did that weird tingle like right before a let down when mine were nursing."
14822,It was so random.
14823,"There really are weird mom things that happen, so I wouldn't be surprised."
14824,"I’m not even a bio mom… I am a preschool teacher/ nanny/ parent educator and even I hear the dog whistle of a nervous “mom!”and instantly crane my neck to see what’s up… 

I’ve walked with nearly a dozen kids at the mall or park until they find their mom or a mall cop to find their mom."
14825,Lol it really is a bat signal for those of us who hear it
14826,"I know some of the secret signs for someone who is being abused, but haven't heard of the secret safety pin that people can wear to help."
14827,Please DM me!
14828,Can you dm me what it looks like?
14829,I've never heard of it but it'll be soon useful to know!
14830,What's the safety pin?
14831,I've never heard of it
14832,What happened from there?
14833,Did you find out why he was following you?
14834,?
14835,"On the other side of the coin, this is still fresh on my mind."
14836,"I was on break yesterday night, outside hitting my vape before I had to clock in, our outside lighting is terrible, and a young girl, couldn't have been more than 14 at most, just casually approached and asked to hit my vape."
14837,"She looked very kind and sweet, but honestly, if I really wanted to, I could've just snatched her."
14838,"I'm a 30yo dude and on my best days I only appear slightly sketchy (I'm not mean in any way, just shitty genes), but it just really blew my mind."
14839,"Ladies, and young men, PLEASE stop doing shit like this."
14840,The world isn't as innocent as you think.
14841,Thank you very much for acknowledging and including both the girls and boys rather than just one.
14842,"Everyone needs to understand situations like this as well as they can, and everyone can find themselves in a tough spot like this as well."
14843,And about ‘safe’ stranger cues also.
14844,I was a social butterfly who literally gave my mom a near heart attack when I left the house at three years old to introduce myself to all the neighbors.
14845,She responded with the 90’s “stranger danger” routine and was confused when I screamed at everyone who smiled at me in the grocery store or when I qdidn’t speak to my teachers.
14846,Good intentions and yet….
14847,"Not all strangers are bad and not all “friendly safe” folks are good, unfortunately."
14848,All behavioral cues that lead to discernment are good things to teach to all people cuz even us 30 something year olds didn’t always get a good education on that lol
14849,Much better.
14850,No need to escalate it into an altercation that can be avoided.
14851,You're welcomeee.
14852,"And no need to try to make me feel better about my height, I actually love being short :D


Edit: typo"
14853,I have a couch sword too!
14854,"Yeah, its not helpful to teach young women that all other women are helpful or maternal, they're regular humans and some of them suck."
14855,I'm so sorry that happened to you.
14856,Fuck them.
14857,Glad you were ok
14858,"To be fair, they may have been scared that they were also in danger from the same man (given they were also very young)."
14859,But that’s still terrible and I’m glad you made it out safely!
14860,But unfortunately that's just not how a lot of women see it.
14861,"A lot of times, the people perpetuating misogyny tend to be women who are like, ""I suffered, and so shall she."""
14862,Sleep?
14863,What's sleep?
14864,"Ugh, I hate sleeping disorders."
14865,Thanks mom.
14866,"I saw the same but went and grabbed a teacher, lmao."
14867,I know nothing of fighting so had no idea what to do.
14868,Teacher pulled them apart real quick and to the day I have no idea what they were even fighting about.
14869,Still happens to me and my child is 14🤣
14870,I call them “spidey boobs”
14871,The mom vibe is real and strong.
14872,"I'm in operations and have no children but I will always stop if I hear a child screaming ""mom"" or ""dad""."
14873,I also will watch children if they're alone to make sure I can find a parent nearby.
14874,I have the added bonus that kids are drawn to me!
14875,Makes keeping them safe easier.
14876,Just a pin.
14877,Plain old pin.
14878,"So people know you're a safe person for those who are marginalized such as members of the LGBTQIA community, etc."
14879,Nah.
14880,He realized he was in a police station parking lot and peeled out.
14881,Lol.
14882,"As a use to be teen girl, and definitely still sheltered to this day, I once was at a party that constantly ignored my existence, which lead to a bit of anxiety."
14883,"So to cope, I went out for a walk."
14884,"Mind you this was after 8PM, when the night was pitch black, and I vividly remember during the walk I saw a sign that said there was high crime and to beware."
14885,Kept walking around the block for 30 minutes before coming back to the party.
14886,When I came back my dad told me I wasn’t allowed to do that alone because I could endanger myself.
14887,I was extremely confused and frustrated as to why I wasn’t allowed to do the one thing that can calm myself down (walking with one of my parents just makes the anxiety worse) despite the fact I knew exactly what kind of danger he was talking about.
14888,"I held onto that frustration for years until I was about 16 and a half when I realize “oh fuck I’m not strong enough to save myself if something horrible were to happen”

I think because I’ve never seen it happen to me or anyone I knew around me I convinced myself I was immune to that specific danger, even though I consciously knew it wasn’t true."
14889,I kind of wish someone were to tell me “look you haven’t learned all the signs to notice when assault is coming and you don’t know how to protect yourself when you do see those signs.
14890,You can’t go outside *alone* at night unless you learn exactly how to spot danger and how to defend yourself from danger”.
14891,"That way I would technically be allowed to take night walks (not threatening my teenage want for trust and independence) but at the same time I still need to work on earning that trust and independence which, hopefully makes me realize that most people don’t have much of a defense against this kind of stuff"
14892,True.
14893,Thank you for not doing anything bad!
14894,Short Kings are amazing.
14895,I should know I've married 2.
14896,I like the cut of your jib!
14897,Couch sword for all!
14898,I like to think there will be more of us than there is them
14899,Ask your doctor about medicine.
14900,My best friend takes something and I'm jealous of how he sleeps.
14901,"my boss, a doctor, takes over the counter melatonin."
14902,"I took an ambian once, the best 4 hours I slept."
14903,But I don't like pills.
14904,"**Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced interactions with surroundings."
14905,"It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness, with sleep displaying different, active brain patterns."
14906,"**

14909,"Same tbh I didn't really think about it, I just don't like seeing people hurt each other"
14910,Oh I feel so relieved that I am not alone in that feeling!
14911,My youngest is 26 and I still get that.
14912,Thank you that makes sense.
14913,"Exactly, even as a man, there's been times strangers have given me a ride and other men have tried groping me, and I'm not even pretty."
14914,"If possible, always use the buddy system, even if it's just a phone call."
14915,"Go with your gut, if it seems off, it probably is, even if it isn't, don't risk it."
14916,"No matter how many videos you've seen, a kick in the balls isn't going to stop someone who's desperate."
14917,"If at all possible, tax time is coming, take a few months in an MMA gym or something similar and let them know why and what you wanna protect yourself against."
14918,"Even if you're complete dog shit at learning to fight, you now have some people you can call on if things go sideways."
14919,"If possible, get your CCW permit, some states don't even require the permit, and carry a gun, there's a huge market for cute concealed carry purses, and same with the MMA gym, gun ranges are a great place to get contacts, and there's plenty of men and women in both places."
14920,Either place will give great tips on keeping yourself alive.
14921,"Odds are, you'll be fine and never need to use any of these things, but I'm more of a ""have it and not need it"" type of person."
14922,No problem at all!
14923,"I work at a place that's very kid friendly (pizza buffet and game room), so just allowing a kid to approach an hit my vape while in uniform wouldn't have been good."
14924,"But you could tell she was comfortable approaching people like this, and it really made me nervous for her."
14925,I'm a very protective person and just the whole situation made me uncomfortable.
14926,"Yee, same goes for tall girls, they pwetty"
14927,I hope so.
14928,"Oh I've got stuff, it just doesn't always work."
14929,"Once I get to sleep I'm usually fine, it's just that sometimes my body refuses to go to sleep despite taking the meds."
14930,So I end up awake for 26 hours before I crash hard.
14931,"And no diagnosis unfortunately, my sleep study came back perfectly normal."
14932,You're welcome dear.
14933,Agree with this 100%.
14934,It took a while but I found out a lot of physical self defense tips and techniques on the internet are utter bullshit unless either the attacker is extremely weak or you are extremely jacked yourself.
14935,"Of course try them if you think it can help you be safer, but it’s probably best to take a class in a gym than to self-teach at home."
14936,I once heard from an interview with a thief that calls from loved ones scare them because that tells them that the person on the other end can and will call the police if anything bad were to happen.
14937,I know it’s not the same but I think a call with someone can act similar.
14938,"If you’re on a call, I’d recommend constantly stating your location to them so if anything happens they know exactly where to call the police to."
14939,"I’m not sure if this is a good mindset to have, but I sometimes think to myself if I get raped or murdered someone better know about it and rope law enforcement into it."
14940,"Also the thing about getting contacts from an MMA gym or a gun range is smart, cause I can’t imagine how intimidating it must be to hear “Hey just making sure, but do we have mixed martial arts training/gun shooting training today?"
14941,"Oh, well can we be on call still?"
14942,I’m at [insert location here] and I’m pretty much alone by myself and bored so I’m wondering if you can stay on call until I get home?
14943,"Haha thanks, see this is why you befriend the best martial artist/shooter in your training sessions.” (Even if they aren’t the best)

Also thanks for the idea of getting a CCW."
14944,"I was originally going to just have pepper spray and a pocket knife, but it might be better to have a carry as well just in case, especially since I’m a petite Asian women who can’t build muscle if my life depended on it, so I know I’m literally a walking target for sexual assault."
14945,I’m glad I never had to encounter anything but that might be due to me being sheltered and not going out much unless I’m with someone.
14946,The more I can defend myself the better
14947,Someone told me seraquil is good.
14948,It's a antidepressant anti psychotic.
14949,This person sleeps well.
14950,"I feel you, I sleep 5 hours maybe normally."
14951,Ambien I slept 4 hours and woke up so awake it was like coke or something.
14952,Exercise?
14953,Run until I was tired (1.5 hours).
14954,5 hours sleep.
14955,"Yeah, if you do go for pepper spray, get pepper gel instead, pepper spray can become friendly fire in a windy area, you'll attack them and yourself."
14956,Knives imply they're already up close and personal and within range to grab you.
14957,"If you have people you can really trust, there are location sharing apps and/or GPS locations tags that you can basically just have on your key ring."
14958,"Hell if you have the money and a roommate, a GPS hunting dog collar would be great just to have in your purse."
14959,They can work a few miles in range and give exact location.
14960,"As far as the MMA/gun range, it even more than physical, another thing is freezing and panicking in a situation, so it can help with a different mindset/ confidence."
14961,Also teaches you what to look out for.
14962,"But if you want a crash course based on a few words, then here:

Target the eyes, esophagus, a good knee or punch to the sternum, these should buy you a few seconds, but nothing is better than getting actually experience/ contacts/ a weapon that  will protect you at a distance."
14963,"if you’re grabbed, fingers are also good to target."
14964,"fighting against a person’s entire grip strength is difficult, *especially* if they’re bigger than you."
14965,it’s easier to get your hand around one finger and snap it
14966,"Yeah, if you can grab any of the fingers, wrap your first 3 fingers around the bottom 2/3 of the attackers finger (your grip should end at the bottom of the 2nd bendy knuckle) grip hard and use your thumb to push the fingers tip to the side."
14967,"With a good enough push, it'll break, but just a little pressure this way is still quite painful."
14968,"The only thing is not to depend on one thing as a stand alone technique, the more you can have in your bag of tricks, the better your chances."

15967,You have brought me loads of joy.
15968,I love you so much.
15969,*i remember this feeling*.
15970,There's nothing like opening that first box of things you were able to afford for your place.
15971,I remember crying when I opened up my new set of stainless steel pots (tip: do not ever purchase aluminum or non-stick pans.
15972,They wear out and will need to be replaced within 5-10 years.
15973,This means you will spend considerably more money replacing them than if you would have if you got cast iron or stainless.
15974,"For stainless to be non-stick, you must heat it up to ripping heat and then pour oil on it."
15975,This will close the pores of the pan and make it less sticky.
15976,You can often find stainless and cast iron that need just a little bit of love in thrift stores.
15977,Please feel free to private message me for more details on how to restore older cookware if needed.
15978,It should be noted that if you have a hard time affording dark vegetables and leafy greens that you should do your best to obtain a cast iron to cook as much as you can in as it greatly increases the serum levels of iron in your body which is incredibly important for menstruating woman if you are menstruating).
15979,"Then came the curtains, a cover for an old ratty couch, and the towels."
15980,"Oh, the towels!!"
15981,"New and soft 🥹 

Reminder to everyone: universal basic income fixes this problem so that no one ever has to cry over a box of basic necessities for survival."
15982,The only way for universal income to enter the United States is with the active pressure of as many citizens as possible.
15983,"Please consider contacting politicians or signing petitions about universal income, And VOTE locally."
15984,Well done honey!!
15985,I couldn't be more proud of you for your strength.
15986,"It takes so much strength to leave, and the fear may never go away..."
15987,But you are looking after yourself and staying safe.
15988,You're doing everything right.
15989,"You didn't deserve such hardship, but you're on the best side of it now :-) Well done, you."
15990,Proud of you!
15991,My daughter and I stayed at one for 4 months nov 2019-Feb 2020… it’s hard starting back over but it’s such a sense of accomplishment when you do.. each little baby step feels like a giant leap forward.

16353,The first tiny studio apartment I ever got after I left my abusive ex could have been a mansion for how happy I was to be in it.
16354,"Buying my own cheap food, setting up a thrift store lamp with a handmade shade of parchment paper, finally getting my cat back from his temporary home and going to sleep that first night with him purring on my bed... And locking my front door and knowing I was safe."
16355,No one could get me.
16356,No one would yell at me.
16357,It was magical.

16426,You've come so far.
16427,"If you have an Amazon wishlist, I'd be happy to buy something for you 💚"
16428,"This is the purest form of spirituality, of raising one’s vibrational frequency- making “little” choices out of LOVE- I know how hard it is to have any possessions in a residential type setting, and how I wanted to blow my (incredibly hard earned and very minimal) money on Red Bull instead of a mirror bc I struggled w the instant gratification…

Anyway."
16429,what I mean to say is that those little choices that ultimately come from love include ourselves!
16430,And I am so fucking proud of how high you must be buzzing with your achievements because I’m buzzin for you!!
16431,and I hope you continue to flourish and receive the things you need and some that you want - can I perhaps send a care package to the shelter with some things to decorate your space with?
16432,"I’m actually moving out west and downsizing and would love to give some things to someone who could use them…the gratitude your post invoked within me will be my daily reflection and knowing you’re better off than you were yesterday has made my day, and I’d love to help more if I can."
16433,I am so proud!
16434,You are doing amazing.
16435,You are so much stronger than you think.
16436,Keep it up!
16437,This post has me tearing up.
16438,Almost exactly a year ago I remember moving into my first bedroom after escaping an abusive partner and buying my very first blanket for my bed.
16439,"It's an amazing feeling, and this is *yours*."
16440,These items are the personal things that are making the space you're in *your home*.
16441,"I'm so so proud of you, you've got so much happiness ahead of you!"

16458,"Darlin', you've worked so hard and overcome so much."
16459,I can't tell you how proud of you I am.
16460,"Oh darling, I'm sooo happy and dancing for you!"
16461,I was a victim of domestic violence.
16462,I got out with my daughter.
16463,"I moved from our home while he was at work, with the help of only one person."
16464,"I remember the feeling of anxiety, fear still to this day."
16465,"I remember the first night in my new place, safe for the first time in years."
16466,I slept like I hadn't in sooo long.
16467,"I remember the feeling of buying things that I had missed, left behind, and the joy that brought me."

16478,Heya sis!
16479,"Gotta be honest when I left my ex, I was very low."

16492,Isn't it amazing how so many little things can bring joy just because they are *yours*!
16493,"Keep looking forward sweetie...life will only get better and as you know, your first step (to freedom) was the hardest and biggest."
16494,The fact you were able to do that shows you're already winning your life.
16495,I am so incredibly proud of you!
16496,"I am so proud of you ❤ 
I remember my first set of towels after I got into a hostel, I cried for an hour."
16497,"It's always a special moment, I'm so pleased for you love, keep treasuring these little moments."

16517,"Darlin girl, I've been there too."
16518,I remember celebrating over a 4 pack of forks and spoons.
16519,"I'd spent the rest of my money on a 10$ fishbowl, and a 12$ fish I named sushi."
16520,"We all start somewhere, I'm so proud of you for getting on your feet and persevering!"
16521,I know it can be hard.

16542,thank you so much Mom!
16543,It does feel good to finally acknowledge me as a person and care for myself as one.
16544,I love the chance to do it.
16545,"I needed this today, thank you!!"
16546,💓
16547,OMG A GOLD
16548,What does this mean?
16549,Is there an award with monetary value?
16550,wait… can you make money from awards people give you?
16551,lol
16552,thank you!
16553,I'm still amazed I did it too sometimes.
16554,I forget how much i can do.
16555,"It was terrifying, but i remember going for it with everything."
16556,"It's been up and down, this week in particular has been confusing."
16557,But I know i can do hard things.
16558,I can get through this too and find happiness in all the moments.
16559,"I needed to hear that today, I needed to remind myself why I started this journey by escaping- because I am worthy of love and kindness and care."
16560,"thank you so much,  i was feeling lost today until reading your message"
16561,thank you so much mom!
16562,"That's so sweet, I needed that today."
16563,and I'm so glad to hear my happiness spread  💚 That's such a gift when I have little to give.
16564,I did get a journal and pen like you said!
16565,I write about everything in it.
16566,"All my victories and bad days, all my feelings, but mainly all my gratitude for all of this."
16567,it's so sweet and joyous.
16568,the pen even as a little red pom pom on the end.
16569,"I sit in the park and journal after a long day of exploring and fun  💙 thank you for my smile Mom, I love you too"
16570,Quick question do you need to heat the pans up and pour oil on it every single time to make them less sticky or is this a one time thing?
16571,"I remember finally getting curtains in my bedroom, the new soft towels, a clothing rack and later a closet."
16572,It was so nice to hang up my clothes after living out of my suitcase for a full year
16573,this is so importnant!
16574,and thank you for sharing all of that!
16575,It's sad that most of us don't know this and need to learn for kind internet mom's like you who really care.
16576,someone recently bought me some stuff of my amazon wish list.
16577,The \*joy\* of knowing I'll have fresh towels for the first time in years tomorrow.
16578,and a new phone case to replace the now sentimental but still literally falling apart case I've been holding on to.
16579,there's so much bliss everytime i walk across my floor and realize it's clean and I get to keep it that way because I finally have lysol wipes!
16580,but tomorrow I'm getting a swiffer!
16581,which means no more dirty knees from scrubbing with my hands!
16582,"I've gotten so used to getting by, i forgot what it's like to not think like that

thank you for caring and speaking up."
16583,I've been advocating for universal income and healthcare too.
16584,necessities and essentials shouldn't be luxuries.
16585,"many countries already have universal income and nearly eradicated homelessness through it, especially after the pandemic hit  


We need people to speak up and share and vote otherwise the cycle continues"
16586,that's so kind thank you!
16587,"I'm in NYC, it was my dream to live here and it's a couple hours away from my previous residence so more safety from the abusers  


Yes starting over is something commendable in everyone."
16588,"Only the strongest get through and happily, the strongest are also the kindest usually because we know how hard it is and don't want to see others struggle the same way   


Thank you for the sweet comment, and congratulations on starting over too!"
16589,\*happy dances\* thank you sib!
16590,happy dancing for you too!
16591,it was a lovely evening of pure joy that kept building on itself everytime I saw my brand new amazing stuff around my room.
16592,Who new something as simple as a mirror and a laundry basket would throw me into a jib every time I see it and walk by it.
16593,"It never gets old and is such a treat on the rougher days  


Yes, I've been journaling my progress and it's amazing to see how far I've come and how leaving an abusive environment had a huge effect on my progress and healing."
16594,I'm a completely different person than I was just a few months ago when I got here.
16595,And a happier grounded one too.
16596,It's a gift that I earned with a lot of hard work.
16597,"thank you, I'm grateful every day for these little comforts and joy they give."

16762,"Unlike cast iron which ""seasons"" by oils undergoing a polymerase chain reaction that creates an anti-stick coating at high heat, Stainless doesn't do this."
16763,"It shouldn't because the pores contract and expand at different temps, which would result in an uneven cooking surface."
16764,"Bonus info: 

 The **most** nonstick pan is a well seasoned cast iron pan."
16765,To season a new (it will say preseasoned if it's brand new.
16766,Ignore it.)
16767,"Pan, preheat your oven to 350."
16768,"Get crisco (though many cast iron enthusiasts choose different oils, this is a good high temp beginner, cheap oil) and a paper towel and spread a *thin* layer of crisco,then buff well with the towel until the oil looks smooth and shiny."
16769,Pop into oven (it's fine if it's not totally preheated) and let bake for an hour.
16770,Turn off oven and let pan cool inside.
16771,Repeat this process three times.
16772,This pan will now have eggs glide around.
16773,"You also need to preheat, but tbh you should be preheating anything that isn't Teflon non-stick."
16774,We think we shouldn't cuz of Teflon lol.
16775,Teflon makes poison when you do that 🤮.
16776,"Do not wash cash iron with soap, unless you want to go through that seasoning process again."
16777,"Use hot water, a Scrub Daddy/Scrub Sponge and baking soda or salt to buff out food."
16778,Place wet pan on stove and turn on until it's dry or dry well with paper towels.
16779,Spread a thin layer of crisco for protection and itd clean and ready to store and use.
16780,"That last layer of Crisco events any areas that may have missed polymerizing from resting in which case you wouldn't need to refinish the entire cast iron 😮‍💨 if you use your cast iron frequently with oil, you will not need to reseason it ever but if you don't use it frequently you might want to re-season it if it gets less non stick."
16781,You can use any and all tools including metal with them.
16782,"To reseason and restore cast iron found at garage sales, estate sales, rummage sales, and thrift stores, message me."
16783,I am so proud of you.

16785,Having wipes.

16787,I really wish that no one ever had to find a moment like this amazing.

16803,They’ll be worn down and unusable but sometimes you’ll open the box and smell the cedar and smile at them.
16804,"And the first time you get to tell some other young woman the same thing, and get to slip her some money and tell her she’ll be ok, you’ll cry and go and open the box again."

16838,You’re welcome!
16839,💓 Seriously.
16840,I still flinch every time I hear a door open.
16841,But I’m learning to breathe through it and remind myself that they can’t hurt me anymore.
16842,And I made sure of that by taking a leap of faith.
16843,Having my own place is such a blessing.
16844,My mental health improved so much when I’m just alone chilling on the couch knowing no one else is allowed in this space without my consent 💚
16845,Received!

16847,this is one of the sweetest things I've read.
16848,I can't imagine the peace and joy you get from that every time.
16849,I can't wait to know what it feels like.
16850,To never worry again and really know that everything is better than okay now and I can take it all in without fear of losing it.
16851,I feel that more and more lately but there's still a part of me that wonders sometimes if it's too good to be true.
16852,But i know it's not.
16853,I'm living it and the past is in the past.
16854,I think I'm gonna make a point to have a little box like this.
16855,Because I want to have that experience often.
16856,I'm honestly so happy for you reading this though.
16857,I'm so happy you know what that feels like and get to experience it often.
16858,I'm so happy that my post about dancing around in front of my first mirror will bring you back to your little box and remind you how far you've come and how proud of you should be of everything you went through to have a better life.
16859,You deserve to celebrate yourself too every time you open your little box and see another young woman on this path.
16860,Thank you for making me so happy and calm.
16861,"There's a lot of crazy things in the world but these little moment, make everything worth it for me."

16875,"I never thought it would get so much support, but it just added to my happiness."
16876,I never actually thought I could be this happy.
16877,At least before I escaped.
16878,"It's incredible to be here now, and be overjoyed by the little things and all the love I've gotten."
16879,"These message do heal some trauma, at least the fear that I'd never know what a mom's love would feel like."
16880,I'm so glad I do now.
16881,Lots of love and hugs to you Mom

16884,"My opinion strongly is that if everyone was just a tiny bit kinder to everyone every day, the world would become a place we all enjoy living and within a few years."
16885,"So, kiddo, be kinder to everyone everyday."
16886,Just a little.
16887,And you'll find that your mindset changes with that.
16888,♥️♥️

16897,Thank you so much 💛 This is really sweet
16898,I made it one whole year today and I'm over the moon proud of myself.
16899,I would like to share my story a little bit though.
16900,My drug journey started on a trip around Halloween to my long distance (now ex) girlfriends place.
16901,She had picked me up and we had a 7 hour drive back to her place.
16902,On the drive she asked me if I'd like to do some drugs this week.
16903,"Now I'd never done anything more than smoke weed by this point but I was curious so I said ""sure!"""
16904,"We end up doing some pressed psilocybin, that she called ""silly caps""."
16905,"These made her trip much like one would expect, but I got nothing other than super sad on them, and didn't really enjoy the experience."
16906,After that a few months later she was in my hometown to visit and on that week she had brought more silly caps and a couple of presses of Molly.
16907,"The silly caps gave the same reaction as last time and I didn't enjoy it, but the Molly had me feeling better than I ever had before and I loved that feeling."
16908,"Fast forward a few weeks and I found a local connect for lsd and ""Molly"" (quotes here are important and I'll explain in a bit)."
16909,After that I spent probably 6-8 months just fucked at every opportunity that I had.
16910,"The days not eating acid were spent swallowing ""Molly"", and staying up waaay to late alone in my room."
16911,"Until one day I decided to stop swallowing the ""Molly"" and snorting it bc it worked faster and felt better."
16912,"I did this for maybe a month or two idk the exact time, those days are really blurry in my memory."
16913,Eventually I was like I should but a test kit and be a little safer with my consumption.
16914,"I had already finished 1g of ""Molly"" and had bought another gram."
16915,"I test it and it's methamphetamine, and probably had been the entire time I had been doing ""Molly"" locally."
16916,"I got scared and I knew how addictive meth could be, but by that point it was too late, I was hooked and couldn't stop."
16917,"I binged for three days, till my body ran out of dopamine and each subsequent hit wasn't doing anything for me."
16918,"No sleep barely any food, and no clue how I got through a day of work in the middle of it."
16919,"But I ended up at this girl's house that I had been talking to for a while, I confessed what was going on and how powerless I felt to stop and I asked her to flush the rest of the crystal I had."
16920,"We went to bed together that night, and she helped me get to work the next day and through the withdrawals and recovery from partying over the coming weeks."
16921,She loved me at my lowest and for that I'm always going to be grateful.
16922,"In the subsequent year after that night, I haven't had anything harder than weed at all."
16923,"And have turned down the opportunity on two occasions to do anything stronger, one was an old dealer hitting me up saying he had LSD and ""Molly"" and an acquaintance offering me a Xanax."
16924,So I feel like if I could be strong in those moments I can continue to be strong as time goes by.
16925,"Good luck to everyone else doing the sober thing, I believe in all of us, and thanks for reading and letting me get this off my chest."
16926,You were so smart to test those drugs.
16927,And you were so strong to want to stop.
16928,"Your girlfriend helped you, but make no mistake: YOU are the hero of the story,  my darling."
16929,I'm proud of you.
16930,"There will no doubt be moments where you feel weak...in those times, lean on friends and remember how strong your heart, mind, and spirit are."
16931,Hey there kiddo.
16932,"I'm so, so proud of you."
16933,Know that the strength to do what's right for you is always there.
16934,"Remember it when you don't think you have the strength, or God forbid a relapse, or when tough times, or even good ones worth celebrating, come to you."
16935,Way to go!
16936,I am so proud of you!
16937,"Stay strong hun, you got this!"
16938,"OP, I have to think about how long I've been clean... wow, thirty-two years."
16939,I want you to know that it gets easier to maintain sobriety as the decades go by and you may scarcely remember your old life.
16940,"When I look back on my twenties, I hardly recognize my old self."
16941,I am SO PROUD of you and want to encourage you to keep going!
16942,Life gets better when you're clean.
16943,"Haha, just realized I made a mistake: it's been thirty-three years."
16944,I'm not who I was then.
16945,Keep going.
16946,It's worth it.
16947,Sending hugs!
16948,HONEY I AM SO PROUD OF YOU!
16949,"I feel kinda weird commenting on this since I’m not a female (but honestly it doesn’t matter, I’m just processing it) but honestly good for you!"
16950,Kicking this kind of stuff in the butt is hard to do but oh so satisfying.
16951,Keep it up!
16952,"Also, what app is this?"
16953,I’m so damn proud of you!!

17024,You got this!
17025,Continue being awesome!
17026,God damn I'm proud of you.
17027,I'm not the type to normally comment on these posts but this one struck me.
17028,When I was about 22 I was at my mother's ex-husbands house (he was my father growing up) drinking alone in the spare bedroom.
17029,My best friend who I hadn't seen or heard from in a few months (this was normal) showed up and confessed to me that she had been shooting Roxicets.
17030,Next thing I know(after an hour of talking) she is sticking me with a needle (consented to).
17031,I continued doing this for about 6 months and then at the end of that time frame I lost 4 friends in 2 days to fentynal overdoses.
17032,I went cold turkey for about 6 months and then relapsed.
17033,Went cold turkey again for another few months and then relapsed again.
17034,I went about 2 years clean and then got addicted to popping Roxicets for a few months.
17035,I've now been clean going on 8 years.
17036,Couldn’t be more proud of you!
17037,You’ve overcome something so difficult and I’m glad you’re here and healthy.

17179,"I am so proud of you, honey."
17180,"You asked for help when you needed it, you've been strong when you had to say no; you've done everything right in this process, and this milestone is well earned."
17181,Keep it up -- you're doing awesome!
17182,Sister here and I wanted to say how super proud of you I am.
17183,"Like, I am beaming here, sis."
17184,I’m glad you took the step to test those drugs because sadly sometimes they get contaminated or mixed with other crap.
17185,My sweet younger cousin died of a meth OD a month ago along with heart damage from prolonged stimulant use.
17186,"We were besties and talked daily, went to school together, all that jazz."
17187,The call from my mom destroyed me and I had to book it back home ASAP.
17188,"Most people had no idea because it’s an easy one to hide and I do not want to see someone else succumb to this drug, it eats at your soul and takes everything from you."
17189,"I also want you to know that it’s OK if you slip up, shit happens and I won’t judge you for it."
17190,❤️ But please reach out to someone close to you if you need help.
17191,You’re loved more than you know.
17192,And thank you for sharing your story ❤️
17193,"Brother here, fucking proud of you bud"
17194,It’s already been said but for anyone using and buying street drugs now it’s very dangerous because of the addition of fentanyl in the mix.
17195,I'm so super proud of you well done!
17196,!
17197,"The acid and shrooms (shrooms more than acid) arent the issue but I definitely understand just wanting to stay away from all hard drugs, ive never done meth but I wanted to for a really long time, I do acid and shrooms and they help me more than make things worst for me imo but they still can be abused and overdone, more than 1-2 times a month max and even then its pushing it, also good on you for not doing xanax, its really addictive and hard to stop and I was and am still into it."
17198,"Alot of drugs arent what they say they are, alot of xanax and meth are cut with fentanyl which can easily kill you, acid you only have to worry about Nbomes because that is lethal if you take too much wheras acid is completely safe (physically)."
17199,"Most molly isnt molly isnt molly at all, which this site  has alot of test of street drugs and you can see that over the past few years there is about a 25 percent chance what you get is real, few years ago it was 50 and before that it was like 12, it depends on whose selling and manufacturing it and how long it takes for them to be caught and seized which when that does happen people start to make fake pills to trick people like you who dont know what to look for and just get that euphoric rush that everyone was talking about so they assumed it was molly, molly is also an amphetamine in its own sense to there are probably many people like you who had no idea what to expect or that you could even test it at home and confirm what it is, I believe certain drugs have their purpose and can be great tools when used properly but when abused it becomes an issue."
17200,"Meth was used in ww2 for soldiers to get energy and stay awake and if it did that safely without the long term effects or addiction then it would probably still be used today, psychedelics are legal/decriminalized in many places in the world and is starting to become decriminalized here, Molly has been used in psychotherapy and has been seen to help cure depression (when its actually pure 100% molly), ketamine (horse tranquilizer) has been shown to help people who suffer with depression and ptsd (again when its ketamine and not cut with meth)."
17201,"As someone who suffers from addiction themselves I wish you the best and hope you keep on with your hard work, it can be extremely difficult especially when you let your world start falling down."
17202,"Quitzilla, I think it's paid but was worth the few bucks for me"
17203,What app is it?
17204,"Your other brother here, omg we are so proud of you."
17205,That must have been so hard.
17206,"Seriously, that is amazing."
17207,"Fentanyl is the worse, even in medical controlled areas it is dangerous, a rehab center almost killed my grandmother with it."
17208,Idk why you're getting downvoted
17209,Because encouraging someone who's sober to try some drugs is a bad idea.
17210,"Yea, some drugs are safer and less addictive than others, but there's no reason to push it like that."
17211,Especially if the way they got into the drug scene in the first case was with lighter drugs which escalated.
17212,"I didnt even notice, maybe cuz im not a mom and some dumb 18 year old."
17213,"I understand what drug addictions like and am the youngest of 3 older drug addicts and a drug addict dad, all are sober now (as far as I know) but it still shows through and I still have lots of trust issues cuz of it and dont really like my family (mom either cuz she pretended like it didnt happen and about how I dont have any clue the type of stuff she had to go through and im just overreacting."
17214,"Id like to be able to be sober and achieve the same things that he did but some days I honestly dont know if I could live without them, ive come to rely on weed, alcohol and xanax and dont know what id do without them, Shrooms and acid are the only 2 that I can genuinely say I have no shame in doing becuase they literally saved my life (at least I feel like they did), something changed the day I did them and I became happier, more optimistic, looked at things from another perspective (and yet still get to extremely depressive states)."
17215,Obviously im not going to have the same views as him an was just trying to inform him how drugs can be used for genuinely good purposes but they also do cross a line eventually and many people have a hard time knowing where that line is.
17216,I know I do and I have friends who dont either that I have had to help pull back to reality.
17217,Ah okay.
17218,I thought they were more just telling their own experiences and about things they've read about them rather than pushing OP to take them.
17219,"Maybe im reading the tone wrong tho

Edit: spelling"
17220,"Yeah, for me personally, shrooms have helped me with my mental health more than anything"
17221,"It was more informing yes, I'm not gonna push you to take anything you don't wanna, I could say everyone should go eat some shrooms and you'll be happy but that's not the case and not everyone should."
17222,"I read it the same way—honest about personal experiences, no “encouragement” to do any kind of drugs."
17223,"yeah, alot better than any antidepressant could do thats for sure, at least for me."
17224,"Oh okay good, glad it wasnt just me haha"
17225,"Absolutely, same for me as well."
17226,"I tried 3 different therapists (one was cool, but ive since moved away) and several different antidepressant meds for my depression/anxiety/likely undiagnosed ADHD, and truly and honestly, shrooms have helped me so much more."
17227,"Obviously everyone is different and has different reactions to different chemicals, but shrooms have definitely helped my mental health immensely, as it has you, and many others as well."
17228,"Ive had a couple therapeutic LSD trips, but I have had some bad trips on LSD and i always feel ""hungover"" in a way the next day."
17229,"With shrooms, i feel SO much love and emotion in general, and even though I have had a few ""bad"" trips on shrooms, none of them were close to how bad my bad LSD trips were, and I truly feel as though ive learned things from my ""bad"" shroom trips as well."
17230,"Sorry, i could talk about shrooms/fungi forever lol."
17231,They really helped me change my life and helped me to start retraining/rewiring my brain into healthier thoughts/behaviors and i will be forever grateful.
17232,"I would say the ""bad trips"" I had were all shroom trips but all my bad trips I've learned from the most so to me they were actually good."
17233,"Acid is more of a party drug imo and is alot more physical than emotional, I like acid with others and shrooms by myself."
17234,I wish I could find a meaning for why they do what they do like so many other people can but I just know they've helped me and kinda made me happier.
17235,Yeah i agree about acid being more of a party drug and being more physical.
17236,I just hate the vasoconstriction i get from acid.
17237,I don't start feeling it til the the beginning-middle of the comedown tho.
17238,And then the next day my body is sore af.
17239,With shrooms i feel so refreshed the next day i love it haha.
17240,"Ive been on a break from acid for a few years; was doing it a bit too often (like once every 2-3 weeks for a month or so, and then like once a month/every other month or so for like 6 mos) which may have played a factor in my bad trips on it."
17241,"I think a lot of it for me is also i think i really dont like how the comedown feels on acid toward the end of the trip, and i think i get freaked out by my dreams/nightmares starting when i try to finally go to sleep at the end, and/or i hate the feeling of being Soooo sleepy but not being able to sleep cause acid."
17242,"Cause any time that ive started drinking alcohol or took a quarter bar of xanax near the end of my acid trip when i start feeling all... Bad trippy lol idk how to explain it like just severe anxiety and really negative intrusive thoughts and shit, both the alcohol and xanax (separate occasions) helped IMMENSELY."
17243,"Not encouraging anyone to do this, ive just found that it helps me in that situation."
17244,"But i also prefer to go out and do things and socialize with people on acid, while on shrooms i prefer to only be with my husband."
17245,"If we had a close friend that was kindhearted and we enjoyed spending time with and trusted and who liked tripping too, then I would also enjoy shroom tripping with my husband and our described nonexistent friend sometimes as well tho."
17246,I have definitely found meaning in shrooms/fungi.
17247,"Acid, like I agreed, feels like more of a party drug tho."
17248,"Xanax has helped me but I like it too much, it helps my anxiety and allows me to talk to people (especially women) and open up much more, alcohol does the same thing but it impairs me more, I have and do combine them just try to keep it at a minimum cuz it is dangerous."
17249,I've tripped with some close friends and some of them were awesome and we connected and opened up and others they kinda showed their true colors (one was an emotionally and semi physically abusive (intimidation tactics) to my best friend who is still with him.
17250,"Ik why she's with him which is why i try to be supportive of her but its hard sometimes, especially with how trauma bonded she is and how much she tells herself everything's ok, but thats a whole other story."
17251,"Okay, I've scanned the comments."
17252,"Please, remember that if you've come here from another community, you are responsible for reading and observing our rules."
17253,"Ducklings, I'm counting on you to report anything that isn't appropriate so we can review it."
17254,💙
17255,They have told you who they are.
17256,Believe them.
17257,I'm sorry you had to find out the hard way how terrible they are capable of being.
17258,Oh darling.
17259,You don't need to pay for maternal love.
17260,"I saw some of that thread and it seems you have a lovely, supportive wife."
17261,That letter must have hurt you lots.
17262,Are you ok?
17263,PS I'm really proud of you!
17264,"I love the fact she is trying to charge “loan interest” lol 
A minor cannot take out a loan, but don’t worry she added an “xoxo :)” so it’s okay!"
17265,Oh my goodness.
17266,"This is not ok. People should only raise kids with the understanding they're never going to ""get back"" the money they spent on them."
17267,"This post would probably also do well on r/insaneparents, for what it's worth."
17268,"Charging you for your entire childhood, including presents, is just bizarre!"
17269,"I couldn't imagine ever doing this to one of my kids, and I'm dirt poor!"
17270,I'm so sorry they're doing this to you.
17271,"Curious, if they hadn't sent you this invoice, *would* you have gifted them any money?"
17272,Are they charging you for…Google?
17273,"Sweetie, when the shock wears off just know we’ve got your back."
17274,They are making a ridiculous request and you don’t owe them anything.
17275,Sending you lots of strength as you navigate this.
17276,You can do it!
17277,I was abused and to this day wish I had parents.
17278,But I learned the hard way i don't.
17279,Cutting all contact was the most freeing healing thing I've ever done.
17280,Your wife's parents are yours now.
17281,And I promise you're so much better for it.
17282,"Since your birth mother doesn't understand what being a mom is, I'm your mom now."
17283,I already have two sons so you have brothers.
17284,All I ask is you send me pics of my grand babies (I love kids!)
17285,"And call me once in awhile so I can congratulate you on all your recent accomplishments,  talk you through anything you wish to talk about,  and tell you the very same things I tell your little brothers every single day."
17286,You are smart.
17287,You are beautiful.
17288,You are perfect just as you are and by just being my baby you matter and are the most loved human to exist.
17289,Nothing you ever do will change that.
17290,I'm proud of you.
17291,You've turned into such a good man all on your own.
17292,To get such a good woman.
17293,To do so w well in business.
17294,To be such a caring and loving human.
17295,You did all that by yourself.
17296,You are magic all on your own.
17297,I'm so fucking proud of you.
17298,And I love you.
17299,Just because you're my son now.
17300,❤❤
17301,You should be so proud of yourself and what you've achieved in life and it sounds like you have a good wife.
17302,I hope you are able to take that money and help people who deserve it while having an amazing life
17303,"Just casually mention that if she wanted money instead of a child, she should’ve decided that about 9 months before you were born."
17304,"Seriously, who invoices their child for the cost of raising them?"
17305,You didn’t ask to be born.
17306,F that noise.
17307,I don't get it.
17308,I don't really understand the itemized list.
17309,Are they asking repayment of money they loaned to you as an adult?
17310,What a longwinded way for mom to say “my love is conditional” :/
17311,"I used to work as a flight attendant, due to the nature of the work itself I had 4 really high life insurance policies, I started working when I was 22, when I filled the beneficiaries I remember thinking ""I will put my uncle as my parents would be devastated to think about it"", once my mother was at my house going through my stuff and she found the policies, she started yelling that I was the worst human on earth, I explained that my uncle had precise instructions on how to divide the money, she became even more infuriated and yelled she was entitled to all of it, then I told her ""do you even realize that for you to cash in the insurance I have to be dead and if you want more money my death has to be terrible"", her answer ""but I deserve the money""."
17312,"Your post brought back memories when I was a child and I used to have what now I can understand were anxiety attacks, due my mother always saying I have to pay her for the food, home, school, etc."
17313,"(The first time I remember this I was 6), I remember I used to wear second hand clothes, hole ridden shoes, only eat 1 time a day, never asked for anything, I truly believed we were poor, in reality my mother drove a very nice and brand new car, she dressed in Dior and used to have dine out daily."
17314,"Run away from that kind of mother, invest on your family."
17315,I’m sorry and I understand your pain.
17316,Im literally mindblown reading all this.
17317,I can’t get over charging interest on “money loaned”.
17318,Has she been keeping a tally for years ?
17319,"Aw sib, mom’s crazy."
17320,"But not fun, let’s run around and make some noise crazy."
17321,"Nope, she’s the kind of crazy that’s mean, abusive, and totally self-centered."
17322,Please pay her no mind.
17323,That letter is the ravings of someone who is not living in reality with the rest of us.
17324,Listen to your darling sensible wife and don’t give your “mother” a dime.
17325,"Instead, take the time and resources you need to continue on that tough, tough journey of recovering from an abusive childhood."
17326,"You’re a brave soul, stay strong!"
17327,Xoxo
17328,"I have to ask, how much have they paid your grandparents?"
17329,You can't be expected to pay for your basic needs as a child.
17330,Even some non essential needs like a phone I wouldn't expect to pay for until I turn 18.
17331,"oh honey

that's just not right."
17332,"get some therapy or talk with someone you trust - right now, you're probably a bit numb and gobsmacked at this ""invoice""."
17333,"Soon enough it's going to hit you that your ""mom"" is a monster, and that's going to hurt like hell."
17334,"Don't give her a dime, and honestly - I'd never speak to her again."
17335,"I would NEVER think to do this to my own kid, who's 28 as well."
17336,"You don't ""owe"" her for raising you."
17337,I just...can't even...
17338,Honey you didn’t ask to be born and you didn’t ask to be born into a society where you would cost money.
17339,They decided to have sex and produce you.
17340,"You owe them nothing, even if they were good parents you would owe them nothing."
17341,The fact that they care more about money and being paid back than you shows that they don’t deserve you.
17342,You enjoy your money and take peace in knowing that you are undoubtedly happier than they ever were or will be.
17343,It’s tacky and shameful they’ve done this.
17344,"On a less maternal note: She can fucking shove it and go for a long walk, off a short pier straight to hell."
17345,I'm very sorry that this happened to you.
17346,"I'll be your mum and tell you that all you need is a warm hug from fun-sized me (I'm barely 5 feet), your dad & I will feed you a lot so don't worry about coming over with your family for dinner twice a week."
17347,I've been told I'm a great cook so I'll probably make you gain a few pounds.
17348,"I guess I'm lucky my parents aren't like yours but if it happened to me and I won a million dollars after taxes, I'd probably sit them down, tell them I'd pay the invoice but in exchange, cut all ties with them because they treated me like they raised me while expecting to get paid for it someday."
17349,"That's not love and parents are expected to provide for their children, it's a societal norm that establishes an investment into the future."
17350,"Of course, they might have done this because money is really tight for them but they essentially sold their relationship with you in exchange for their own comfort."
17351,"Yeah, I'd probably go nuclear."
17352,"If they chose the money over their relationship with you, you have every right to abandon them and tell them you were speaking theoretically so, no handout but you've peaced out."
17353,That's killing the goose that laid the golden eggs right there.
17354,-_-
17355,Jesus this is awful!
17356,I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this.
17357,"I really can’t imagine expecting my children to pay me back for taking care of them, they didn’t ask to be born."
17358,You do not owe this money and it offends me so much that there are parents who do this.
17359,"Yeah, my mom tried to bill me too."
17360,It's a cry laughing (as you tear it up and tell them to get bent) sort of situation.
17361,"My bill was presented to me on my 18th birthday, as I was moving out - no cars or anything like that - just an itemized bill for my childhood expenses (food, clothes, vacations, school stuff, etc) with a handy monthly payment plan."
17362,She never got a fucking dime of that out of me.
17363,"At first she was outraged that I wasn't taking it seriously and spent a few months stomping around being mad, saying shit like, ""So what!?"
17364,"I'm just OUT all that money!?"""
17365,But turns out it's widely considered batshit and monstrous to expect to be paid back so she eventually shut up about it.
17366,"By the time we stopped speaking completely, it was one of those things she didn't like being brought up because it made her look so stupid and mean."
17367,"The only thing I'd be ""discussing about what works/doesn't for all of us"" about this bullshit is that provided they never so much as fucking mention it again, I will pretend they never did anything so ugly and shitty."
17368,"Hi, Dad here over from r/DadForAMinute,

I'm proud of you."
17369,"Your mom's way out of line there, and I apologize for her."
17370,You're doing well for yourself and that's what's important.
17371,"Your parents financial responsibility, or lack thereof, is not yours."
17372,"Keep up the good work, and live *your* life for you, not others!"
17373,"Sincerely,
Dad"
17374,"I’m so sorry sib, my mom used to always jokingly threaten me with the hospital bill from when I was born."
17375,"She had it, and would say I will pay her when I get older."
17376,I would always say I didn’t ask to be born anyway but it messes with you in the back of your mind.
17377,She’s passed away now but that was part of the ways she was very tough with her love.
17378,"Most of our parents are also hurt children, they may not intend to pass along that hurt but they do."
17379,This is nutty.
17380,I’m a mom of 2 and I only want them to have a good life.
17381,If I could have made it so they didn’t have college debt I would.
17382,I hope to pay for my daughter’s wedding and help both of them with down payments on their houses.
17383,And of course be involved with my grandchildren and give them money as well.
17384,Isn’t that what all ‘normal’ parents do?
17385,Are your parents “of faith?” By which I really mean; do they have an actual church/building where they attend weekly services?
17386,"I say: Nail it to the door ala Martin Luther’s ‘Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of [the] Indulgences’ of [insert your parents’ names here]

Super Snark

Some people deserve to be publicly shamed."
17387,"I hope it's OK for me to post here since I'm only a few years older than you and have a toddler, but I'd just like to tell you that you don't owe your parents anything."
17388,"Neither money nor your time, energy or love."
17389,As a single mother coming from a dysfunctional family myself the only thing I want in return for raising my child is for him to grow up as a happy and healthy person and I hope I'll be able to continue to support him financially when he does.
17390,"I know this is hard for you right now and I only have a big internet hug to offer you, but I'm sure after some time you'll be alright."
17391,Take care and don't let them guilt you into anything.
17392,This is emotional blackmail.
17393,"OP, I am **so** sorry."
17394,I don’t know whether I could forgive my parents for pulling a stunt like this.
17395,"Maybe give them a little money, and then not associate with them anymore."
17396,They must have known that they were trading their relationship with you for cash.
17397,The “XOXO” makes my stomach turn.
17398,"I’m so lost , is this from adulthood?"
17399,Like a time period when you were living with them?
17400,I’m so sorry.
17401,I grew up with a girl who got billed when she turned 18.
17402,"Her parents had her watch her three siblings every weekend and various times through out her teens, and would pay her allowance for it and her chores."
17403,They were on the bank account with her where they forced her to only save her allowance.
17404,Once she turned 18 she got the same kind of sheet of paper.
17405,It had everything from shampoo to the food she ate growing up.
17406,They wiped out her savings that had a few thousand and expected more from her.
17407,This is NOT what a loving parent does.
17408,"Please seek counseling trying to navigate this, I cannot even fathom the hurt."
17409,You owe them nothing.
17410,I’m so sorry you are dealing with this
17411,Is Google in the list?
17412,Is your mom ok?
17413,"It does seem pretty insane, I can't help but wonder if she's suffering from some mental health issue"
17414,I could NEVER imagine doing this to either one of my sons they never asked to be born I made that decision and they deserve my unconditional love and support no matter what I am here to care for them not the other way around smh
17415,"when you have a child, you choose to take on their care until they grow up and are ready to start their adult life on their own."
17416,"and even then, you never stop supporting them."
17417,this is low and you deserve better because you are a beautiful human being.
17418,cut the toxic people out of your life that aren’t part of your joy and success.
17419,go no contact.
17420,I am confused ; is your mother Tom Nook?
17421,Gross.
17422,You don't owe anyone for choosing to raise you.
17423,"If they didn't want to pay that, they had options."
17424,If my kid came into money I'd be happy for them that they get to have an easier time in life.
17425,"I might hope for a nice gift, but this?"
17426,This is not ok.  *hugs* This is why my teenager is liberal with her hugs.
17427,She's seen how cruel some parents can be.
17428,"Don't pay them a damn penny, and you might want to get a lawyer to send them a quick cease and desist letter."
17429,‘Invoice’ my ass.
17430,Burn that shit and cut her off.
17431,"You don't owe you're parents for looking after you, that is LITERALLY the job of a parent"
17432,"I really like the ""various"" charges and ""expenses""."
17433,Is that charging for Netflix and google?
17434,"I'm sorry this is happening to you, as others have said, it's not a very maternal action."
17435,How old are you?
17436,You deserve so much better than the hand you were dealt.
17437,I'm so happy you found a good partner and have some money you can use for yourselves.
17438,I want you to be healthy and happy.
17439,You deserve that.
17440,Someone opportunistically taking advantage of you is a horrible feeling; it’s even worse when it’s a close family member.
17441,"It’s a very difficult situation, OP, and I am sorry you have to go through this."
17442,"And by “difficult situation”, I mean in terms of navigating the relationship moving forward now that this has happened."
17443,"What isn’t difficult is knowing you should not pay them a single penny, even though it sounds like you originally were going to share some."
17444,"Trust me, it will never end if you give them anything."
17445,You will forever become a human ATM and the resentment you feel will only get worse.
17446,"For something like this, my advice would be to make sure you are firm and non-emotional in your response, making clear you’re not paying them and it is not something up for further discussion."
17447,"Cutting it off at the pass will likely lead them to blow up, probably stop speaking to you for at least a little while, and perhaps even cause them to paint you out to be some sort of monster to other friends and family members."
17448,All of that is still preferable to paying them anything and forever feeling indebted.
17449,"(Besides, the second they tell anyone they tried to invoice you for your childhood and you wouldn’t pay, it’s them that will be the obvious monster and not you.)"
17450,Internet hugs to you!
17451,"Just in case you weren’t aware, this is called financial abuse."
17452,Children don’t owe their parents for being raised.
17453,You didn’t choose to be born; they chose to be parents.
17454,You didn’t force the responsibility on them.
17455,They made the choice and *they are responsible for the consequences of their choices.
17456,* They’re adults and they should start acting like it.
17457,"You are not obligated to pay this, legally or emotionally."
17458,"If she didn’t have a pre-existing agreement with you that any of these things would be given to you on the grounds you repay her, then she has no legal standing."
17459,"No sane lawyer would represent her, and any sane judge would laugh her out of the courtroom, if not denounce her audacity."
17460,Remember: you are allowed to be your own person and live your own life.
17461,Good parents don’t birth children for obligation.
17462,"Edit: Also, you can check out r/JUSTNOMIL (it’s for people with toxic moms too) if you want more advice or just to lurk."
17463,"I'm so sorry to see this, sweetheart."
17464,Idk what's wrong with your mom but it's not about you.
17465,Sounds like your wife is awesome.
17466,I'm happy for you for that and I wish the two of you a wonderful life together!
17467,"(far far away from that crazy lady who has lost her mind, hurting you like this)."
17468,Big hugs sweetheart and congratulations on your windfall!
17469,"Love, mom"
17470,"Even if you were thinking of gifting her a portion of your money, this is... beyond ridiculous."
17471,"I'm sorry, love."
17472,You deserve better.
17473,"You don’t owe her, and it’s ok to throw the list away."
17474,"Work on getting yours and your wife’s finances set, and then use the rest to do good for others in the community."
17475,"Oh sweetie, I’m so sorry."
17476,"Also, your other mom sucks at math."
17477,"When I clicked this, I seriously thought your mom was playing a prank on you -- it was unthinkable to me that your parents would invoice you like this!"
17478,"When I realized it was real, and saw all the comments that are rightfully angry about her request, I agreed with them."
17479,I still do.
17480,But...
17481,I had another thought when I saw the note about retirement.
17482,"I'm in my late 20s, and personally I worry a lot about my parents in the future if/when they retire, because due to some setbacks and their unique situation (trying not to go into too many personal details!"
17483,"), I'm not sure they have saved enough, even though they've worked all their lives, and are still working."
17484,"They'd never ask me for money, however, out of fear of limiting my ability to develop my own career/life *in any way."
17485,"* But to me, this is part of the issue."
17486,They were thrifty so that they could give me all the opportunities I've had -- much more than they did growing up --  and at times paid for me when they could have saved (i.e.
17487,"at university, they paid more so I could do less workstudy and focus on schoolwork; later I realized that my peers whose parents earned much more did not, and felt guilty about it)."
17488,So I actually wish they would be open with me about their finances and the gap between what they have and what they need to live comfortably when they do retire.
17489,"If it turned out that they needed a lot more help than I can help with, it's still possible for me to change careers (love my job now but know I can earn more doing smth I like less), but I'm pretty sure it's bc they're worried I'll do that that they don't tell me."
17490,"Although it's so touching that they always want to maximize rather than limit my freedom to choose how I live my life in the way I find happiest, I simply wouldn't be happy seeing them short on money in retirement or unable to retire and not being able to help."
17491,"So thinking in terms of my family, if it were really an issue of retirement budgeting, and I could afford it, I'd help out in a heartbeat."
17492,But our family situations may be very different -- only you can be the judge of that!
17493,How much did her parents charge her for her upbringing?
17494,More like r/insaneparents
17495,"I’ve spent more than 116k on therapy, I’d be guessing based on this stellar letter from your mum that you could easily rack up an equal or higher amount."
17496,Good on you for becoming an awesome human despite having asshole parents xx
17497,I have a feeling they claimed you for as long as possible on their taxes as well.
17498,I’m petty and if it was my mom I would figure out the  deductions and credits she got and send her a invoice for that.
17499,Or tell her to write me out of her will and call it even.
17500,My mom has been really horrible to me regarding money my whole life so I feel your disgust and shock.
17501,The xoxo and smiley face in the signature make it for me.
17502,Raises it from simple crazy to bat-s@$# crazy.
17503,You should offer to pay for her funeral and a big party afterwards.
17504,One thing a lot of people learn late in life but is true nonetheless.
17505,You don't owe family ANYTHING just for being family.
17506,This hurts my heart.
17507,I’m sorry.
17508,"“Thanks mum, since you want to put everything in money terms, I’d like to default on my debt."
17509,Goodbye forever”
17510,Tell your mom you already paid in full from your childhood trauma
17511,"Heyo, seems that document is written in pencil."
17512,Burn it and say you never got the envelope!
17513,😂😂
17514,I would write her back because I'm petty.
17515,"Thank you for the invoice, this was a real eye opener."
17516,"I was planning on gifting you money but after seeing this, you will receive nothing."
17517,A child is not responsible for the cost incurred for bring brought into existence.
17518,With this being said if the cost is so upsetting then maybe you should have never reproduced.
17519,Get a job and piss off.
17520,....
17521,If you pay she will only ask for more.
17522,A parent who loves unconditionally does not request payment for being a parent.
17523,"I'm sorry you are dealing with this, don't let your mom treat you poorly."
17524,"Sadly, I could see my mom doing this type of thing to me."
17525,She’s a big manipulator with money.
17526,"I know it may be hard to hear people call your mom a narcissist, esp if you’ve never considered it."
17527,My mom is and it’s still hard to swallow sometimes.
17528,Wishing you all the best my friend—you do not deserve this type of bs at all
17529,I understand.
17530,My Mother is like this too.
17531,We love you here.
17532,Do not feel less than anything because your parent sent you such an awful letter.
17533,I’m here for you if you need support.
17534,🤍
17535,Big hugs.
17536,Sweetie life is 30% what is done to you and 70% how you *choose* to react.
17537,As I see it you can either frame it and use it as a reminder that there will be toxic people that live in a swamp of their own making but whether you dip your toe in and join them is entirely up to you.
17538,"Or take a seat and calculate how much life is going to cost you, then invoice your parents - after all you didn't ask to be born and life is expensive 😉  don't forget to include therapy for their parental failings."
17539,"It's not wrong to walk away, particularly if it is the only way to live in peace."
17540,I did and I've never looked back.
17541,"Oh my baby, no."
17542,Just no.
17543,You don't deserve this nonsense.
17544,"Nothing about this letter is ok. 

You have my blessing to walk away, far and fast."
17545,Write back; sue me for it.
17546,No judge on earth isn’t gonna laugh her ass out if it even makes it that far
17547,Unbelievable cruelty.
17548,I am surprised she didnt include the Hospital bill from your Birth and cost of Nappies etc.
17549,This woman does not deserve to be called your Mother.
17550,You deserve better- ditch the witch.
17551,Sucks when your family shows their true colors.
17552,I’m sorry to read about this and can only imagine the sick feeling in your stomach.
17553,I did have this happen to a friend of a friend (not in writing though) and they counter billed for all their services.
17554,They said that they would be happy to settle if either party could produce a copy of the signed contract that was agreed to prior to the undertaking.
17555,There was a period of about a year where there was no communication before the parents realised how shit they were.
17556,Good luck
17557,"My Dear, a mother’s love is free."
17558,"The only payback I want to see is you thriving and living a happy, free and independent life!"
17559,Sending you the biggest hugs!
17560,Tell her to to fuck herself
17561,Send her a bill for non concentual birthing of you into existence
17562,"I’m a mum, and I can’t think of any circumstances under which I’d ask my kids for money."
17563,"(And your mom isn’t asking, she’s demanding)."
17564,I think I’d have to be completely desperate (I.e.
17565,hungry and about to lose my home).
17566,Cutting off your abusive parent:PRICELESS
17567,By what contract can she invoice you?
17568,Absurd.
17569,"Tell her no, and point out that she has no legal leg to stand on."
17570,"Then go to a bank and make sure that she has no access to your savings, by placing a strict no-exceptions condition on withdrawal."
17571,"Finally, be kind to yourself because you didn't create this awkward mess."
17572,"My wife's mother at least provided a spreadsheet

Edit: and included the cost of gifts, not only given to my wife , but me and our kids as well"
17573,Nope.
17574,Moms do not charge their children for childhood.
17575,I’m so sorry.
17576,Id laugh at this so hard if my parents tried that with me.
17577,If i agreed to any loans with my parents i would pay them back those and nothing more.
17578,Id then turn to them and id say i had planned on gifting you x ammount but since you are such scumbags and decided in your insanity to hand write out some garbage invoice for my childhood you can now thank yourselves as that has been reduced now by 75%.
17579,"Hand them a cheque for that ammount, tell them you never thought they would be such scummy human beings to have the idea its remotely ok to invoice you for your childhood and then dont speak to them for 6 months or so."
17580,"No baby, you don’t need to pay this, and this is a horrible thing to do."
17581,Congrats on coming into some money.
17582,Please enjoy the freedom and safety it gives you!
17583,Buy some hollywood/movie/prop money.
17584,Stuff a brief case or bag with it.
17585,Hand that to them.
17586,I’d let them know that you didn’t sign any documents.
17587,"Additionally, you’re not legally able to sign a contract below 18."
17588,"Therefore, those expenses are your parents."
17589,You’re probably going to have to move out because it looks like they slipped and we’re knocked out during Parenting 101.
17590,"My boy, throw dis shit away!"
17591,"HAHAHAAAHHAAA

In what world can a person RETROACTIVELY re-define the financial support of their own child as a fucking loan???"
17592,Honestly fuck these dumbasses
17593,"I would start with the old ""by forwarding this bill you are admiting no family ties are between us."
17594,In such events I will have to refer you to my lawyer who takes care of financial disputes.
17595,"Until this matter is settled I will be radio silent."""
17596,If they want to act like debtors instead of family this is about all you need to say.
17597,You should tell her you were going to give her some money but your so disgusted by this you’ve changed your mind.
17598,Okay.
17599,You do not have to pay this.
17600,You do not have to pay for love and you do not have to pay for the care your parents gave you.
17601,When people get desperate they will hurt anyone to try and survive.
17602,My mom did this to me for money she gave me and I didn’t ask for 15 years after the fact.
17603,It will probably ruin your relationship and I highly recommend therapy to deal with this kind of hurt because you realize the people who are suppose to love you unconditionally just put a price on their love.
17604,It is wrong but do not pay this you are worth more than this and sadly your mom is flawed like mine is.
17605,Best wishes.
17606,One more thing wanted to add.
17607,This is so messed up on so many levels.
17608,You do not deserve this.
17609,I am furious for you.
17610,"And other are correct, they have shown you who they are."
17611,"Hey sweetie, as many have said please do not give these people one red cent and absolutely consider going no contact."
17612,Per some of your comments it seems this relationship has not served you well over the years.
17613,Just because someone had a hand in making you does not mean they get continued access to break you.
17614,It also seems like you’ve got quite the wife.
17615,Use that money to build towards you guys’ future together.
17616,You don’t owe anyone anything for existing.
17617,A real mom would congratulate you and at worst make a joke about where are you taking her now that you’re loaded but you’d know she doesn’t actually expect anything in return because raising you was her pleasure.
17618,If you’re still seeing a therapist please bring this up and explore what drove you to almost pay them back.
17619,So it sounds like your parents didn't plan well for their own future and want to take part of yours.
17620,Please invest the money in your family.
17621,"As a mom of four, I spent as much as I could on them and have never regretted a penny."
17622,Ask her if this is her way of letting you know they need a loan.
17623,"Since you have come into some money, you assume this is why she would point the sacrifices she has made for you."
17624,"Such a rude, uncalled for thing for a mom to do."
17625,"I'm so sorry, sweetie!"
17626,Love you❤️
17627,"you do not need to ""repay"" her for being a PARENT."
17628,If she didn't want to provide those things she could have adopted you out or aborted.
17629,"YOU as a CHILD owe your PARENT nothing, they forced you into this world, you did not ask to be here."
17630,I’m so sorry OP.
17631,Ask her to provide the original loan agreement you signed.
17632,She doesn’t have it?
17633,Then there was no loan.
17634,Tell mom to eff off.
17635,They either didn’t plan for their futures or are being greedy with money that’s not theirs.
17636,They had children.
17637,They knew the costs involved.
17638,I just can’t even believe you have to deal with this.
17639,This is vile beyond belief.
17640,Everyone deserves an unconditional maternal figure that doesn't see them as a cash cow.
17641,I do not keep track of expenses spent on my children and everything spent is given willingly and with love.
17642,I'm so sorry that you've had to receive something so traumatic and so telling.
17643,Please avoid all contact for the sake of your mental health.
17644,"Blood makes you related to this woman, but she is not your family."
17645,Your wife sounds fantastic and I'm so glad she is there to help you see clearly.
17646,"Edit: should you ever speak to her again, ask her how much her parents and your father's parents billed them and when they made the payments."
17647,I'd be interested to hear a response
17648,Tell them to take you to court.
17649,They will get laughed out of any lawyers office in minutes.
17650,Children do not ask to be born and raised.
17651,That is a decision your parents made.
17652,You owe them nothing.
17653,I’m so so sorry this happened to you.
17654,❤️
17655,"If you don’t send her back an invoice for emotional damages in the sum of $116,088.22… I swear"
17656,My parents did this to me when they found out I had some money.
17657,Decided they were entitled to some of it.
17658,Became a huge enough thing I had to cut them out of my life for a while.
17659,You do not owe them anything.
17660,You do not exist for their retirement plan.
17661,"I would never, ever, in a million years invoice my son."
17662,Would not even occur to me.
17663,"I am the parent, it is my responsibility to care for him."
17664,I will ask his help with things ie take me to urgent care when I can’t drive myself but that’s part of being a family.
17665,And he knows he can count on me.
17666,Anyone who invoices you is being a narcissist gaslighting manipulator and you should put up some hard boundaries.
17667,If those don’t work go no contact for a while.
17668,"You deserve to be loved and cherished for who you are, not your wallet."
17669,My mom has done this to me since I was a kid.
17670,It’s financial abuse
17671,What in the WORLD??
17672,Oh my lord the ENTITLEMENT of this woman!
17673,"You probably don't need to hear this for the thousandth time, but DO NOT give her or your dad any money (for *anything*, because they'll construe it as an ""acceptance of debt"" now,) and DO cut them off completely before their behavior gets even more outrageous."
17674,You don't owe your parents anything.
17675,They CHOSE to take on those expenses when they CHOSE to become parents.
17676,"All they've earned with this behavior is a cold, cold shoulder, period."
17677,I would kindly let your mom know with a letter that this “invoice” has cost you a relationship with her and her current (or future) grandkids.
17678,The cost of parenting is a choice you make when you decide to raise kids.
17679,I’m assuming when you were 9 she didn’t let you know you would have to pay back everything she spent on you?
17680,This is so toxic and I’m so sorry.
17681,I do not quite agree with everybody else here.
17682,"You say you are 28, and this invoice covers the last seven years, so from you being 21 up to now."
17683,"So we're not quite talking ""costs of bringing up a minor"" here but ""costs of a young adult living at home""."
17684,"Don't get me wrong - I have kids of my own, some of them being adults, too, and while I would never write them such a ridiculous invoice - I do expect them to contribute financially to our household, like rent and food, BUT only because they have a financial income."
17685,"And we had a talk that was clearly labeled as such, ""Talk about contributing financially"", and I give them a roundup of our costs each month."
17686,In a way we are more like room mates sharing a flat - with the special perk that I cook and do more of the chores.
17687,I do this because I want to prepare them for the moment they make enough money to move out.
17688,"To be used to the need to pay money for rent, to budget, to have a look into the monthly costs of living."
17689,"So, to make this short: I \*\*could\*\* understand your parents wanting to contribute financially to the costs of living, but to just spring this ridiculous invoice at you... is pitiful, at the least."
17690,"I don't know if you ever negotiated about you contributing, if you had some sort of income or not, if these amounts were something out of the ordinary."
17691,"But I'd say:

If there was no earlier negotiation about you paying them back for anything on this list, this is ridiculous and shameful and you should NOT pay them."
17692,"Cause, as already said, it will open the flood gates."
17693,It is good on you that you wanted to gift them some part of the money anyway.
17694,"Maybe you still feel like it, maybe you want to re-label that money as ""reimbursement"" for their general generosity."
17695,But I understand how much this has to have hurt you.
17696,Hugs from me.
17697,Why is it redacted though?
17698,"I would like to point you towards r/raisedbynarcissists 

You don't have to pay this."
17699,She certainly sounds like my narcissist mother...
17700,Treating us like business transactions/ATMs that work for them.
17701,The fact she paid you that just to make you repay her that back.
17702,I'm so confused.
17703,"She ""gifted"" you money so you could pay it all back."
17704,For what?
17705,My reaction to this billing nonsense was anger.
17706,How DARE she??
17707,Just move on with your life and leave her in the dust.
17708,Invoice her back for every household chore you’ve ever done or errand you ever ran for her + interest.
17709,This seems a bit shady... some of this looks like stuff you borrowed money from your parents for with the understanding that you'd pay it back.... are you sure there isn't more to this than you've stated?
17710,"Also, honestly, if you've come into a lot of money and your parents have come to you needing help.... what's wrong with helping them?"
17711,I'm not suggesting you put yourself in a bad position by helping but if you have the means then why not be a helping hand?
17712,"I really do think you're not being honest with us or your wife or yourself here... 🤨

Edit: Why can't we see the entire letter from your mom?"
17713,"Other than personal info, of course, is there more that explains her position in that letter?"
17714,I am so proud of you for surviving an upbringing with parents like this and coming out of the other side.
17715,"You don’t owe these people anything, and if you don’t already see a therapist then I would recommend talking to someone now that you have the means to fund this."
17716,You are worth far more than any monetary value they have placed on your upbringing
17717,"Ick, I'm so sorry you're going through this 😔 

I didn't read the invoice letter because this topic/narc moms are still super triggering."
17718,"But all it took was reading the first pic and the ""love mom, xoxo, exclamation point"" to know exactly how it was meant."
17719,Sending you virtual hugs
17720,Charging family money is an immediate or agreed-upon thing.
17721,You don't just get to randomly decide what they owe you out of the blue.
17722,"It's unfortunate that they didn't account for their own retirement budgets, but that isn't on you."
17723,"Shallow though it might seem, I'd cut family out of my life for that sort of bs."
17724,"If they budgeted as she said they do, she would have never done those things for you without making it clear it was a debt to be owed."
17725,I'm sorry.
17726,Send her a bill for being born and all negative experiences you can think of that resulted in you being born.
17727,Not like you chose to have you as a baby
17728,Send her a return invoice for any picture taken of you because you did not provide written consent.
17729,Issue late fees starting from birth.
17730,Follow up with any chores or family activities you had to attend.
17731,And then bill them for more than they asked for.
17732,"That's insane, I'm sorry your mother's such an asshole OP

You should make sure you keep all interactions between you and them recorded,  Then photocopy the invoice so you have duplicates."
17733,I'd also asked for proof of a signed contract ( all three signatures) that you agreed to pay to be born.
17734,Maybe speak to a lawyer just to double check she's no leg to stand on.
17735,Just incase she goes full crazy and tried to sue you for the money.
17736,"It's ridiculous though, clearly they failed to save for their retirement and are now trying to make you pay for it"
17737,"Not a mom, sorry."
17738,"But as a hypothetical sibling in this sub, I’ll let you know of how I dealt with it."
17739,"This happened to me growing up (my mother kept an ever-growing excel spreadsheet) and it just *barely* ended 2 months ago when I had to cut all ties completely with her and the rest of my family, all of whom apparently saw my actions as disrespectful and harmful to our mother’s mental health."
17740,"Be strong, and just know they can’t actually enforce this and it’s also what everyone would call “obviously manipulative.” Stay strong and stand your ground."
17741,You deserve better - and they don’t deserve your payments
17742,It's odd when you get blindsided by someone who is supposed to give you *unconditional* love.
17743,"Sib, I'm so sorry this is happening to you."
17744,This is tangible evidence that your mother sees your relationship as transactional.
17745,"And that's a really crappy thing to realise about someone who's supposed to love you, no matter what."
17746,"I don't know what else I can offer apart from ""aw yeah f\*ck buddy""s on my end, and strength to help dealing with this level of narcissism."
17747,Be sure to invoice her for your therapist
17748,"I just want to give you a hug and tell you your mom is wrong on so many levels, I can’t even begin to count them."
17749,Don’t give her a dime or you will be opening the door for future extortion.
17750,"Because that’s what this is, emotional extortion."
17751,I have loaned my adult children money but with the agreement that they would pay me back which they have.
17752,"I have also paid for their college, bought them furniture and things they needed when they were first starting out."
17753,I hesitate to call them gifts because it was something I wanted to do as a parent to help my kids but they were gifts in the sense there was never any expectation to be paid back.
17754,My kids have paid me back by being self-sufficient and having a good life.
17755,"The point is, when they did these things for you was there an agreement that you would pay them back?"
17756,I doubt it.
17757,Would they have asked you for this money if you hadn’t come into some money?
17758,Also doubtful.
17759,Mourn the fact that your parents aren’t perfect and do what you need for own peace of mind but don’t give them a dime.
17760,"If you decide to cut contact, remember they were the ones who handed you the scissors."
17761,"If they press for money, tell them it’s already being invested for the future…your children if you haveany."
17762,Oh buddy.. this is painful.
17763,How any parent can charge their own child for their childhood is beyond me.
17764,"If your parents think they can demand something like this from you, I would suggest getting some legal advice."
17765,"Maybe get a letter written up, in case they start getting real shitty."
17766,"Oh bud, that’s so hard to receive :(
Take some time and keep on talking to your wife about how it’s affecting you and what you’re feeling."
17767,You’re a good person and deserve to have someone that cares about you.
17768,"I also know you’ll be tempted to respond to your mother out of your anger and hurt to make them feel the hurt that you feel, but OP, please hear me when I tell you, while this will feel good in the moment, it won’t in the long run."
17769,How you respond is about one thing - what type of person do you want to find looking back at you when you look in a mirror?
17770,Do you want to see a vindictive person that acts out of hurt?
17771,Or do you want to see a generous person who’s kind and generous even when people hurt them?
17772,"You can’t change who your mother is or how she acts, but you can change who you are and how you acts."
17773,And you’re a kind and generous person!
17774,"I already saw it, when you said you were planning to give them money!"
17775,"Be that person, don’t let their behavior change who you are, continue to be the person you already - kind, thoughtful, inquisitive, and generous."
17776,"And while being that person, you can still tell your mother how you felt when receiving her invoice."
17777,"Also know that I’ll support you and be proud of you whatever you decide to do, good or bad or in between, simply because I’m proud of you!"
17778,You matter so much and always will!
17779,"To modify the quote of the father from Dune, “the only thing I require of you is to be my SonForAMinute” and you’ve always done that!"
17780,I’m proud of you.
17781,I trust you.
17782,You don’t owe them anything.
17783,Not even a penny.
17784,Don’t pay them.
17785,They signed up to be parents.
17786,You didn’t ask to be born.
17787,Loving parents do not expect their kids to pay them back.
17788,Oh honey.
17789,You don't owe your mother or father a single cent for raising you.
17790,That was a choice made by them.
17791,No one owes their parents for raising them.
17792,No one.
17793,"For real tho, don't give them a gd cent."
17794,That is UNBELIEVABLE.
17795,I would NEVER.
17796,Imagine.
17797,I can't even...I'm so upset on your behalf.
17798,"If I were you, and I'm being 100% honest right now - I would tell my mother to pound sand, and to sue me."
17799,Then I'd let her think long and hard about how our relationship is worth 116 grand while I never speak to her again.
17800,Was the loan she’s referencing an agreed upon loan or is she just calling it that now?
17801,I thought you said this was being asked to be paid back for your childhood but these look like adult expenses?
17802,"Don't send any money, fuck them for doing this."
17803,I’d try out another sub called raised by narcissists.
17804,This is….wow
17805,"Like I said before, fuck that and fuck her."
17806,We don’t expect our children to “pay us back” for having raised them.
17807,Tell her you’re certain the State run nursing home she’ll be in eventually will be quite adequate to her needs.
17808,The fact that she had been working up the nerve to give you this since Sept shows that she knows just how fucked up it is….and still chose to do so.
17809,To her child.
17810,That blows my mind.
17811,I wouldn’t give her anything.
17812,Money is more important to her than not hurting you.
17813,So she will keep hurting you.
17814,Don’t open the door for her to do so by giving in to this.
17815,I learned someone from this aweful man.
17816,He would make promises to his employees (raises or bonuses for unmoral and unethical deeds) and they would do it.
17817,"They would come asking for payment and he would reply,

""Did you get it in writing?"""
17818,"See, he would promise verbally, which in the state we lived in did not constitute a legal agreement."
17819,"He could promise anything, but he never signed any paper or made offers in writing, so it wasn't legally binding."
17820,"They couldn't take him to court because there's no legal contact (plus because of the content of the request, they'd likely be fined or jailed, but that's beside the point)."
17821,"This man likely falls into the clinical diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, so I hate that I learned this valuable legal and business trick from him."
17822,"In the world of money, if you want a promise kept (payment for a loan, services, or product) you must sign a contract before the exchange of goods."
17823,"I'm betting your mom didn't have you sign a contract 2003 (when the invoice began), 2014 (when the interest began), or now upon request of repayment."
17824,"Perhaps she typed up an agreement for just the loan, but I didn't see that mentioned anywhere."
17825,"Even if she did, a minor cannot legally sign this kind of contact."
17826,The parent cannot approve the signature of such document if they're the other party and I doubt she got you a legal representative and did it in front of a notary.
17827,She wants to play hardball?
17828,Put on you pads and hit back.
17829,"""I see you are interested in payment, may I see the contract where I legally agreed to pay this back?"""
17830,"Seeing as this is family, it could be difficult to get over emotions but this document isn't being considerate of yours, so just a view point to consider."
17831,Playing hardball with anyone is tough but it's harder with your parents.
17832,You may want to try other routes but keep this logic in your pack pocket if things escalate.
17833,"Note: I'm not a lawyer, in the justice field, or in the financial field at all."
17834,"This is simply stuff I've learned through life experiences and is not adequate legal/financial advice, just an relatable life lesson I've learned."
17835,"If you are truly worried, you may want to talk to a legal professional about your rights and obligations."
17836,"Even if my child ended up a complete fuck up in adulthood, I wouldn’t even dream of “charging” them for being raised."
17837,Did you sign a legal document before you were even conceived asking them to birth you and be your parents?
17838,The only money your mom should get from you is whatever you are willing to expend on her psychiatric bill.
17839,"Well seeing how their care for you was purely transactional, then it’s safe to say your relationship with them isn’t going to be the same after this."
17840,Just obviously don’t pay them and then distance yourself from them.
17841,"If they ask, just tell them that you were unaware of how they felt about you in the family but now that you know of the burden you choose to separate from that."
17842,Don’t pay them what are they going to do sue you?
17843,Lmao
17844,I think your mom is going to have a hard time explaining how she could have entered a legally binding contract with an infant.
17845,"Whatever your decision is, you aren't repaying your parents anything."
17846,You never owe your parents a dime.
17847,"Love the little psychological manipulation by writing ""it may not seem like a lot of money to you"" to try and make it sound like they're not asking for much, when it's clearly alot of money for anyone."
17848,Obviously unsure if real because internet.
17849,Do not pay a cent.
17850,This is not legal.
17851,Go to a lawyer who can at least advise you on how to frame your response.
17852,Keep documentation of everything you receive and everything you send in reply.
17853,"Because you should not, and hopefully will not, pay this, they might cut off communication - consider the benefit of never receiving stressful bullshit like this again."
17854,"If you won the lottery, this is very common for people who are like your family members to ""cash in"" their previously unconditional love and support."
17855,It's more tragic because obviously you planned to share your windfall but they couldn't help themselves and got impatient.
17856,"I can't imagine how it feels knowing your parents are this insensitive, delusional and mean-spirited."
17857,Pay them in Monopoly money.
17858,You owe her nothing.
17859,Maternal love and general parenting is not debt for the child to repay.
17860,"If she wanted to be paid to parent, she should have been a nanny or babysitter."
17861,Dont send a penny
17862,Crossing out the big ticket items makes me suspicious.
17863,Children don’t pay their parents for being a parent.
17864,Parenting isn’t a job that pays.
17865,I’m sorry.
17866,"This is *exactly* like something mom mom would do—and did, although for a much lower amount."
17867,I’m so sorry your mom did this to you.
17868,I understand how you feel.
17869,"Although I did pay my mom her request (because I had already been intending to pay her even though there was no agreement to do so beforehand), I don’t think you have any obligation to pay her."
17870,This is just ridiculous.
17871,you didnt choose to be born or to have such a selfish mother.
17872,you never signed up for any of this so just laugh in her face and tell her to take you to court & you will countersue for court costs when you most definitely win.
17873,Wow.
17874,Just wow.
17875,You don't OWE anyone anything.
17876,I do think you need a good therapist because you have been abused.
17877,This must have been such a shock to receive.
17878,Can you maybe put together a statement of what it is going to cost to care for them when they are no longer able to care for themselves?
17879,PLUS INTEREST.
17880,I am so sorry this happened to you.
17881,So how'd you come into money?
17882,Can I have some?
17883,"/s

Hopefully this doesn't turn into a prolonged crapfest, as these things sometimes do..."
17884,"Omg she charged you 13,000 of interest!!!"
17885,!
17886,Nope.
17887,Tip that up and throw it away.
17888,That’s gross of your mom to expect you to pay her back for things she’s gotten you throughout the years.
17889,Love with demands and conditions are things you will not find here.
17890,There's not enough money in the world that equate to how amazing and valuable you are.
17891,You are priceless.
17892,You already know what kind of conditions your love had with your mom but now you have the receipts.
17893,"Consider this invoice the ""final notice"" on the mom/child relationship."
17894,I hope you're in therapy and install the healthy boundaries you need to move on from this destructive and truly awful thing.
17895,You got this.
17896,She’s given you the cost of raising a child.
17897,I dearly wish that instead she’d looked at all the priceless rewards.
17898,You should never have to feel as though you were ever a burden or an expense.
17899,I’m so sorry.
17900,My mama heart breaks for you.
17901,Please don’t give her any money—not after this.
17902,"You deserve better, and I hope you have people in your life who make you feel that way."
17903,I’m a dad but felt compelled to comment.
17904,My kids are  not even teens yet but I cannot fathom ever wanting to take from them.
17905,Jesus Christ you greedy miserable waste of space let your children prosper.
17906,You have been so irresponsible that you’ve gone into late adulthood so unaccomplished that now you want to take from a child you brought into the world.
17907,I’d bet you owe the child everything on that list.
17908,The child owes you nothing.
17909,They’re not an employee.
17910,I can’t comprehend this thought process.
17911,Oh hun we would never charge you for that.
17912,Being a mom is all about raising you and loving you and doing whatever we got in our power to give you as many tools to be a happy adult.
17913,Love isn't a transaction.
17914,"Search your own feelings of course, and as always we encourage you to reach your own conclusions."
17915,But our money is on this not being a very loving thing.
17916,"My mother did something similar to me once, and I had NOT come into money."
17917,"I have four kids, myself—some of whom have cost me $$$ as adults."
17918,"Money I didn’t want to dish out, and wouldn’t have had to for myself."
17919,"Having said all that, I can’t bring myself to think of any circumstance that would cause me to present my child with a bill."
17920,"If I had to ask for money, it would be over dinner and I would be sad to have to do it."
17921,"Like, I would really have to need it and know my kid could afford it."
17922,All I want for my kids is to learn how to build good futures for themselves.
17923,Start saving for retirement young.
17924,Learn how to invest.
17925,Gain emotional intelligence.
17926,Dumping an invoice on a kid for things he or she didn’t realize I considered “loans” doesn’t work with that philosophy.
17927,My mother did it to hurt me.
17928,She didn’t even need the money.
17929,She was just trying to be mean.
17930,(It worked.)
17931,"I’m not telling you what you should do, because as your mom4amin, I want you to make that decision, yourself."
17932,It’s important to me that you know you followed your own sense of right and wrong.
17933,"So, I am a teacher who could be a handwriting analyst with the crap I have to decode."
17934,And the-woman-who-claims-to-be-your-mom's handwriting hurts my head.
17935,"As for how to handle this, tell her 'no.'"
17936,"Tell her there were no contracts or agreements, and she is not entitled to this money."
17937,You will be using it to help your family.
17938,And tell her to get her crap together or there will be no further correspondence.
17939,"Urgh, my son is 1 and I’m already planning for all of the money/things we plan to give him for the rest of his life."
17940,(Also trying to make up for what we didn’t have) You owe your parents nothing.
17941,I’m so happy you have your wife by your side to let you know how effed up this is.
17942,Don’t give them one penny.
17943,Your birth certificate was not a contractual agreement.
17944,"She has no moral, legal, nor ethical leg to stand on, and she is in fact an absolute hag."
17945,I am so sorry.
17946,"I have a narcissist for a mother and had to go no contact, and this was the flavor of her abuse."
17947,"If this is any indication of your relationship with her, I can’t imagine what else she’s put you through."
17948,I am so sorry.
17949,Oh hell no.
17950,It's the parent's job to provide for their children.
17951,"It took me a while to understand the invoice is something you had to pay her and not the other way around…

Bro, don’t pay this, you don’t have to pay for this to deserve your mother’s love."
17952,"And if she needs you to pay for it, than it was never love in the first place"
17953,Interest??
17954,Don’t tell me she’s charging you interest on this so called “loan” she gave you omg wow.
17955,"Laugh about it, throw it in the trash and give no response."
17956,You’re stronger than you think you are.
17957,Sounds like you would fit in with r/raisedbynarcissists
17958,"This is awful of course, but it's just hilarious she sent you a gigantic bill handwritten in chickenscratch."
17959,If you're going to extort someone at least have the courtesy to itemize it in excel.
17960,My Dad told me I was his retirement plan.
17961,"That I needed to care for him after he quit working because ""everything he did in life he did for his kids and we owe him""."
17962,I grew up with this so it was my normal.
17963,My husband's parents showed me what family really could be.
17964,How beautiful and great.
17965,It hurts to hear your parents say that raising you was a burden you need to repay them for.
17966,You weren't/aren't a burden.
17967,"You are a gift, a blessing, and I for one an happy you are here."
17968,"Sometimes, walking away from your blood and finding ""your family"" to fill with people who love and support you and don't obligate you repay them for being your family."
17969,It took me 20 adult years to learn this and implement it in me life.
17970,I still miss my parents but my life is much happier and fuller now.
17971,"Take this money, set aside some to enjoy, find a financial advisor or someone who has done well with their money and get their guidance."
17972,Invest in your future and love a life worth living.
17973,You are a gift!
17974,My daughter has friends who have created their own families because their blood relations behaved so badly.
17975,"It’s a very healthy response- you are now free to do that, too."
17976,"You will find lovely, loving people who will vue you and you can celebrate each other."
17977,Put this behind you.
17978,It’s sad- but it’s done.
17979,"I'm sorry, it sounds like it's time to cut your parents out."
17980,I love my babies and everything I do is because I chose to have them and raise them.
17981,"My Mothering isn't a loan, it's a gift."
17982,"I hope you are okay, or will be okay."
17983,"I would not engage on this ""request""."
17984,They’ve shown you exactly who they are.
17985,Time to go no contact and block them on everything.
17986,Oh honey.
17987,This belongs on r/entitledparents as well.
17988,I'm so sorry you're going through this.
17989,"I need more context, OP says these are charges from childhood but car #1, car #2, rent, car repairs, gas etc sound more like things an adult would need money for, not a child."
17990,If this is explained already I apologize.
17991,"Reading that it looks more like an adult child that never paid back their parents for them helping them out, A LOT!"
17992,"It’s possible that your mom thought that by trying to “itemize” a large amount of money into an invoice format would give some justification for asking you for money, where her pride could not just simply ask."
17993,Ok but did you really borrrow 2-3k every year for 4 years and had no intention of paying it back?
17994,Hugs.
17995,this is fd up.
17996,You could also create an invoice for all rhe chores they made you do.
17997,It was child labor.
17998,All the emotional stress as a child when you were grounded.
17999,Im sorry.
18000,You deserve better than this.
18001,Brother here.
18002,"So I read your first post and couldn't respond there, I'm glad you have a good wife and brother-in-law, write them out of your life and ignore them."
18003,Don't give them a dime.
18004,Peace.
18005,"Lots of ideas here, reddit can be supportive."
18006,"Even so, I think you’d do well to take all these ideas to a psychologist and/or psychiatrist and talk through all the conflicting thoughts and emotions, to sort out how you really feel about this situation, and how to respond in a way that you’ll be content with for the rest of your life."
18007,"My parents were good to me and they’re long gone now, but I still have some regrets."
18008,"I wouldn’t want them to dominate my life, I just want them to make me a better parent and grandparent."
18009,Take the long view!
18010,A psych** professional can really do that.
18011,"If you’re religious (I am) you might also talk to a clergyperson, but I’d still say talk to a psych** first because in that relationship their responsibility is more tightly focussed on you as an individual."
18012,Best wishes!
18013,Sorry I am calling massive BS and entitlement.
18014,"&#x200B;

You claim to be 28."
18015,The pictures you have provided for the most part start in 2014.
18016,"By my very basic understanding of math, you would have been 20 years old in 2014."
18017,You claim your car was totaled by a deer.. so ?
18018,They paid insurance ?
18019,"Looking at this we have Cars, Internet Subscriptions, Gas, Tickets, Phone, Computers, Repairs, Towing."
18020,"&#x200B;

Nothing I see on this list is from prior to 2014."
18021,"Looks like you had an entitled and privileged support system that helped you get on your feet from 2014-2021, you moved on whilst you parents are stressing for money."
18022,Either that or they are narcissistic and you never noticed till now.
18023,"Pay your bills and tell you parents that of course, any burden you placed upon them whilst you was an adult ""finding yourself"", you will try to help them feel whole again."
18024,"Anything before 18, was an obligation they had when they decided to have children."
18025,Is she... Is she basically charging you for raising you?
18026,I'm guessing that the 50k + is legal/lawyers fees?
18027,"Not sure what else parents would take out a loan for you for that size for, other than private school or a very, VERY nice university."
18028,"Man, it's so sad you just lost both your parents."
18029,Some of this stuff is legit.
18030,"Like if you got a ticket, yeah give them some money for that."
18031,But if these expenses were paid with no expectation you would pay back fuck that.
18032,"I borrowed money here and there from my folks, but it was always with ""this is a loan, I need a little help, but I will pay it back""."
18033,"If it wasn't like that, then no."
18034,[removed]
18035,"Perhaps you should invoice her for the therapy you need after this...

Don't pay this."
18036,"Seriously rethink your relationship with her, keep your distance, and actually therapy would be a good idea."
18037,Sorry you're having to deal with this.
18038,It’s better than what my now x husband (me 67F).
18039,Did .
18040,"I worked and saved over 120,00 all my life."
18041,"He being the head of the household spent over 75,000."
18042,"Ilent some to my daughter to buy a home,she is paying me back."
18043,All that money was for retirement and for my children when I die.
18044,You my friend have someone looking out for you!
18045,[removed]
18046,It’s your mother … give her the money
18047,"I mean they did give you a TON of shit, I didn't get 99.9% of this."
18048,Had to fend for my own.
18049,I would repay them without them even having to ask....I cant wait until my parents retire and I can take care of them.
18050,Just my culture though.
18051,Yea.
18052,You owe your parents more than that.
18053,But it’s a good start.
18054,"I just came into money and decided to retire my mother, the least I could do."
18055,"$800k later, she’s a happy momma pursuing her old hobbies and interests she had given up for me for 25 years."
18056,[removed]
18057,"Personally I'd just buy $100 ish in pennies then just throw the rolls at her

1 you're still giving her money

2 they hurt

3 she'll have to clean it up"
18058,"Cool, your Mom’s a Doctor!"
18059,"Thus, good news is she will do fine without you paying her a dime 😉"
18060,I am so so sorry this happened
18061,Generation X retirement plan.
18062,I’m so sorry she is doing this to you.
18063,"Just ignore her as much as possible, and you may also be able to find some support over at r\raisedbynarcissists."
18064,"Additionally, has her handwriting always been that bad?"
18065,Tough titty!
18066,If she wants money then she just needs to pull her bootstraps up and get a job!
18067,Lol
18068,Just send her a copy of this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PiaY2GQuuzA
18069,Are those charges for google in the second pic?
18070,?
18071,Shit let me hold 1000 we're best friends from elementary
18072,Invoice her 116088.21 as charges for your soul incarnating into this world and then another note saying that you’re happy to adjust that against her invoice.
18073,"My mom did not only get me in financial trouble before I was 20, she also demanded that I paid her back for having my 18th and 20th birthday parties."
18074,"Parties she initiated and held, with mostly her friends."
18075,"The financial trouble she got me in, was for a gasoline debit card I got her, because I worked at a gas station at the time."
18076,And she just stopped paying the bills.
18077,"When she wanted me to pay for the birthdays, I told her to shut the f up."
18078,That I would pay the gas card bill and she would never mention this again.
18079,"My brother got a lot of money gifted when he was 13, and he has never seen these money."
18080,"She just toke them from him, telling me that she would loan them and pay him back."
18081,"She never did, and now both me and him gone NC with her."
18082,"Tell them that you're morally bankrupt, can only pay them pennies on the dollar as a result, and send them a cheque for $1,160 dollars"
18083,My aunts and sister and pretty much everyone did this to me when my dad died.
18084,People are awful
18085,"Light a fat blunt with a burning $100 in front of her and show off your fresh back tat, then jump into your iroc and burn rubber."
18086,"😂😂😂😂 well, that makes it so much easier not to ever talk to them again."
18087,"Many many years ago, i heard my best friend’s mom say something like: “the fact that we’re related by blood was just a coincidence, I’m sane enough to chose my own family now”."
18088,"If my mother tried to invoice me, that would be it."
18089,I would never speak to her again.
18090,Oh my!
18091,Parents make the choice to have children and being a parent comes with expenses that are your own responsibility.
18092,Your mom sending you a bill for the expenses of raising you is so incredibly out of line.
18093,This Mumma's heart hurts for you.
18094,"A mom should be a loving and supportive force in your life, making space for your disappointments and celebrating your successes."
18095,It's not a position of entitlement.
18096,"You don't owe her money, accolades, or anything else for your upbringing, period."
18097,Hugs to you.
18098,I'm having a hard time understanding these charges.
18099,Several cars and loans or something?
18100,At what age and what was the context?
18101,I’m just want a picture of a god dang hot dog.
18102,No words
18103,I’m so sorry dear.
18104,I know how bad that must have felt.
18105,My mother did something similar to with money she gave me for school and to help with a down payment on a mortgage but it wasn’t near this bad.
18106,"I tried to pay her back slowly, like $200 a month."
18107,"And when my husband got very sick, I told her I need to halt payments."
18108,At which point she said “You’re still paying me?
18109,!” That made me feel even worse!
18110,She didn’t even know I was putting money into her account.
18111,So I just stopped and never started after my husband got better.
18112,I promised myself I would never ask her for money ever again even if I was going to be homeless.
18113,I still love my mother.
18114,But I have to be very selective with how I trust her.
18115,Tbh it’s the same with my sister.
18116,It’s tough when the people who should be there for you no matter what do stuff like this to you.
18117,A piece you of you dies inside.
18118,Try to focus on the relationships in you life that are fulfilling and worth you time (and money).
18119,Send an invoice back for your time.
18120,I’m confused.
18121,Did they just send you a bill for your childhood?
18122,No.
18123,No.
18124,No.
18125,"Send them a letter stating you need original receipts, spread sheet, original contract etc."
18126,State you’ve reached the end of the contract and will no longer be using their services and to put you on their fo not call list.
18127,"Should they call you they will be sued for harassment 

When a person has kids they expect to pay for everything."
18128,And it makes us happy to do so
18129,Send her a invoice back where she owes you the same amount plus one dollar.
18130,"My mom threatened to sue me, when I turned 18, for certain costs of raising me."
18131,"I was scared and hurt and surprised, to say the least."
18132,"Intellectually I knew she couldn’t pull it off, but I was still scared and unsure."
18133,What I did was put together a statement that I would pay her X money in return for her claim to be dropped.
18134,It was all the money I had saved from working the last year.
18135,"(And, to add context, she had kicked me out a year earlier, and she was just doing that to get cash - she was a pos no-job drunk who had been recently dumped, and i was a convenient mark.)"
18136,"so, I emptied my savings, took her to a notary and she had to sign for the cash."
18137,I paid it and went no-contact for years.
18138,"To me, parents are just more strangers who will treat you like it at their convenience."
18139,Next time we spoke- guess why?
18140,Of course- she needed money and saving.
18141,———- oh——- I see you used their credit card as a grown adult - - of course you pay them back for that.
18142,You made choices.
18143,"""When you have a child, you gotta raise that child."
18144,I will generously consider this towards the debt owed to me for birthing me without consent and having legal authority over me for 18 years.
18145,I am also willing to write off the rest of that debt.
18146,"As always, I love you"""
18147,This is the perfect time to remind your mother that as an adult she made a decision to have unprotected sex with your father and the actions & money she is invoicing you for are the results of her decision not to abort you and not your concern
18148,How do you take pictures of documents without that shadow?
18149,"I had to send some paperwork to the state, and r  FB Rey told me to eff off they hate teachers so much so they use any excuse to destroy our lives."
18150,I ended up having to pay for scans at a UPS store them the state of Washington kept lying and claiming they never revived them.
18151,Do NOT PAY ANYTHING.
18152,You will never win on this.
18153,Your mom has dementia
18154,"These ""expenses"" come with the territory of having and raising children."
18155,"Parents do things like pay for housing and food and car repairs because they want to make sure that their children are always safe, happy, and healthy, certainly NOT because they want some kind of repayment."
18156,"Your parents probably did these things originally because they felt an obligation too, but to now put it in your face for repayment shows 2 people who are greedy and manipulative."
18157,"I know it's easier said than done, but listen to your wife and do not entertain this."
18158,"If your parents cause a fuss about it, cut them off, you're an adult now who can choose who you deal with....you're no longer a child that is forced to bend to their will."
18159,Set boundaries.
18160,Cut 'em a check for 10K and never talk to them again.
18161,Don’t give them a dime
18162,What the hell?!
18163,"I would never invoice my kids like this, how callous and cruel."
18164,I’m so sorry she did this to you.
18165,Oh wow.
18166,I’m so sorry.
18167,This is not ok and your mother is greedy and mentally ill. My mom did a similar thing asking me to pay her mortgage.
18168,Long story but I stopped talking to her several years ago and recommend you think about doing the same.
18169,I don't know how much money you happened upon but if it's enough to pay this comfortably I'll tell you what I'd do in this situation.
18170,I'd pay her the money and never speak to her again.
18171,If that is the conclusion my own parent came to and I could afford it then fine...
18172,But I would be gravely offended.
18173,Firstly though I'd likely ask my mother why she presented it this way and ask why she would treat me like this and explain why it offended me.
18174,Then I would ask why she didn't just ASK for money if she needs financial help instead of demanding it in such a cold and offensive way.
18175,Walmart.com 😝
18176,Shitty bro.
18177,Do not give anything.
18178,Nothing.
18179,"Honestly, I would cut off all contact and tell them how deep that cut."
18180,Honestly if you came into a lot of money and can pay em for the loans And cars they bought you I don’t see the problem at all.
18181,you don’t have to pay that.
18182,i’m so sorry your mom is pushing that on you.
18183,"Sweetheart,  I will be your mom."
18184,"You know the ""Free hugs"" sign?"
18185,All the  mom hugs are always free.
18186,I'm so sorry that this person wants money more than she wants to be your mom.
18187,How hurtful!
18188,Please don't give those people any money.
18189,A person who thinks that it is okay to charge her son money *_with INTEREST_* for doing her parental duties is the type of person who will never be satisfied with what they get.
18190,Charging interest as if this was an agreed-upon loan is the part where this really becomes super insane.
18191,"This is not appropriate,  not reasonable,  not loving, not  acceptable,  just overall WRONG."
18192,You deserve much better.
18193,"Anytime you need some love from some internet moms with the occasional internet dad and some internet siblings, we are here."
18194,"What you should have heard instead of getting a @$#!&+ invoice was, ""Oh my son!"
18195,Mom is so excited for you!
18196,How wonderful!
18197,What are you going to be able to do?
18198,"Any dreams you've always had that you can work on now?"""
18199,This internet mom is very excited for you and I hope that you can find a way to bring joy to yourself and your wife with the windfall.
18200,Keep it away from rotten people who just want to use you.
18201,All i see here is a couple parents guaranteeing that they aren't going to the nice retirement home
18202,This is insane!
18203,Is this a bill for your whole childhood?
18204,I’m so confused about the random google and square space charges and why she chose to add a few random gas expenditures??
18205,I’m sorry that your parents did this.
18206,"But as folks said before, at least they gave you a clear picture that your relationship is transactional and you can begin to grieve and heal ❤️"
18207,"Oh my lord, honey, I’m so sorry."
18208,This is wrong for so many reasons.
18209,You have a lot of good advice about not paying this demand so I won’t add to it except to say I agree.
18210,"What I want to press though is that you are a wonderful, valuable human and worthy of love and care and attention simply for being who you are."
18211,The fact that your mother has made her love into a business transaction reflects only on her.
18212,You are loved.
18213,You are cherished.
18214,You are important.
18215,You are worthy.
18216,You are worth more and simply ARE more than this invoice tries to make you!
18217,I'm so sorry your parents are like this.
18218,I wouldn't dignify that with a response and I would not talk to them anymore either.
18219,I’m so sorry.
18220,This must feel awful and you don’t deserve to be treated like this at all.
18221,It sounds like you have a wonderful partner now despite having grown up with abusive behavior like this.
18222,You are loved because you deserve to be.
18223,"What a sad, miserable, and loveless life your parents choose for themselves."
18224,Proud of you for choosing otherwise.
18225,It’s not easy.
18226,Why does your moms handwriting look like it was done by a serial killer writing a ransom note?
18227,Did your mom give this to you in person?
18228,"If not, I'd check in on her, she might be chained up on her basement by some guy trying to extort a very specific amount of money to pay off a sports gambling debt"
18229,Your mother has some dogshit handwriting
18230,Send her Monopoly money
18231,"And if you don’t, dad and I will be forced to sue."
18232,Love you!
18233,"Emotional abuse, run far away!"
18234,Why does she think you owe her this particular amount?
18235,"There’s so much blacked out, there’s no way to tell if some of this is loans that she gave you or your dad gave you."
18236,"A lot of it is nonsense, but all of the blacked out stuff?"
18237,That’s seriously messed up.
18238,Check out r/bogleheads for financial advice.
18239,Send back a pamphlet on the consequences of unsafe sex and never take any bs from her again
18240,Oh boy.
18241,"Do not give her anything, including a relationship with you."
18242,She is a vulture.
18243,I wanna see the receipts on how she repaid her parents.
18244,I'm so sorry honey.
18245,"When a parent chooses to have a child, they accepted all the responsibilities for that child themselves."
18246,"It's the same as agreeing to sign for a loan, or agreeing to take in a pet."
18247,"When you made the decision, the responsibility became yours alone."
18248,Honey you owe your parents nothing here.
18249,"If your mom needed money, well, I think it shouldn't need to be said that there are better ways to ask for it than this demand letter."
18250,"I only can hope that this is something your mom will realize was foolish, that she saw dollar signs and lost her head for a bit, and that at some point she'll remember that your relationship should be about more than money and offer an apology."
18251,I'm happy for you getting a good break and wish you well in the future =)
18252,That's parents these days
18253,This looks like something my mother would do.
18254,"I havnt come into some money like you but if I did, there is no chance in hell I'm telling my mother."
18255,Or family.
18256,I feel your pain.
18257,My mom died of dementia a couple weeks ago and going through her stuff I came across a couple of her journals where she mentioned cognitive issues she started experiencing more than 20 years ago but never told anyone.
18258,We only noticed her problems six or seven years ago.
18259,"But now — knowing how far back her problems began — some of her decisions, particularly as they relate to the damage she did to her interpersonal relationships, really make a lot more sense."
18260,Has your mom’s handwriting changed over time?
18261,It looks wobbly.
18262,Get her to a neurologist.
18263,Yeah no this is not ok or normal.
18264,"Not only was it her job to make sure you live a happy and comfortable life, there is absolutely *no* reason to have that much need to control your kids finances."
18265,"This whole thing is bullshit, excommunicate your mom if she presses this issue."
18266,"I would charge her $116,000 for reading that atrocious handwriting."
18267,They could be great doctors with that shit handwriting
18268,Did they find out that you make and/or made a lot of money?
18269,Gold digger
18270,Wow.
18271,LOL.
18272,Looks like something my mother would do.
18273,Still love the lady but the obsession with money is unreal.
18274,"Yeah, if there was no communication in advance that these were meant to be paid back, this is absurd."
18275,"I’m so sorry, because I see no way to resolve this without rancor, and family is so important."
18276,"Invest the $116,000."
18277,Tell mom and dad to suck it.
18278,"Yes, raising  child is difficult and expensive."
18279,But you didn’t ask to be born and raised.
18280,That’s a financial risk they took.
18281,"Sad part is, depending on how much money you came into, you would’ve probably given them a nice financial gift."
18282,Them hitting you with an “invoice” is just parental financial abuse.
18283,You should just buy new parents.
18284,Can I ask how old you are?
18285,I feel like this doesn’t need to be said ….
18286,But you don’t expect repayment from your kid for raising them.
18287,"As a Mom, I’m happy to be able to provide for my kids."
18288,I certainly won’t be invoicing them.
18289,And the fact that this goes back to when you were 9?
18290,Please don’t give them any money.
18291,This is not how parents behave.
18292,Lol wiggly ass hands
18293,Give her 5000 and cut her out of your life for good
18294,That'd be a great way for me never to talk to my parents again if it was serious
18295,Did you do any chores as a child?
18296,We're you reimbursed at a standard minimum wage?
18297,"I don't know what all the items are as they are redacted, but if they are trying to charge you for basic necessities make sure you invoice then for all the hours you did chores as a child."
18298,"Wtf, did they just give you a bill for raising you?"
18299,And where tf did these numbers come from?
18300,Putting specific amounts ($5k something twice for ‘various’?🙄) does not make it real.
18301,They don’t even have receipts lol.
18302,"I’m guessing you make a decent amount of money, so mom thinks she can leech off you?"
18303,Also just curious if your mom is older?
18304,Older people always have this same writing style.
18305,I’m sorry she’s like this.
18306,I sympathize.
18307,"My mom only loves money, too."
18308,"Pull an aziz ansari and buy her a 100,000$ cake instead"
18309,I’m so sorry :/ this is shitty.
18310,Obviously you don’t owe her any money.
18311,She chose to have a child.
18312,It was a choice on her end.
18313,Choosing to have a child means you are choosing to spend lots of money in them.
18314,Even after they’re 18.
18315,"I hope you can find love and supper in other places, because this can definitely be triggering"
18316,Absolutely not.
18317,"Parents choose to bring children into the world, they don't owe anything except the love and respect they themselves received in childhood."
18318,And most adults give it willingly when they had good parents.
18319,This isn't it.
18320,"All those years ago she made a baby, not an investment at JPMorgan."
18321,Why are so many of the expense blacked out?
18322,Why the fuck they charging you for square space?
18323,What is that even a reference to did you make a website at one point or something?
18324,Disown them!
18325,Not even got the decency to have the conversation face to face.
18326,You don't need people like that!
18327,Glad to see you here!!
18328,Look at the hundreds of moms who would never in a million years treat their child the way your mom has treated you.
18329,"She is not the norm, she is an anomaly and a horrible one at that."
18330,"Keep being your wonderful self, sweetheart 💜  
  
Edit: just saw the loan interest line."
18331,I'm seething.
18332,Imagine charging interest on your son for raising him??
18333,The audacity.
18334,I hope you go No Contact for this.
18335,She doesn't deserve you.
18336,If it ever goes to court counter sue for being brought into this world without your consent!
18337,Get a new parent.
18338,"I don't know anything more than what you've shared here, but this is a challenging message she's sharing with you."
18339,"If your parents sacrificed a lot to help you succeed, then finding ways to help them out is pretty standard."
18340,"But if she's listing what they'd provide for all of their children without sacrifice, or without a shared goal of you moving to a different level of success, then this is a true dick move."
18341,My psycho aunt tried to do this to me after my mother died.
18342,A 55K bill for helping at all with her dying sister.
18343,Including costs of sandwiches fed to dying sister.
18344,I told her to fuck right the hell off.
18345,So sorry some families suck.
18346,"It never feels better, but you live and learn."
18347,You didn't ask to be born or to have her as your mom.
18348,Don't pay shit.
18349,You do not owe your parents for having you.
18350,They chose to have a kid.
18351,They pay for kid.
18352,Kid does not owe it back.
18353,Kid did not agree to be born.
18354,Do not pay them
18355,"Haha, my mom literally did this to me when I received a settlement from a car accident."
18356,"She didn’t go through and give me a list of things I owed, just told me she was getting half."
18357,She did not get half.
18358,"As a mom, this hurts my heart."
18359,"My children are still very young, and I love to buy them things and do things for them."
18360,"We don’t have a whole lot of money, but I do what I can, and so does my husband."
18361,I can NOT imagine billing them down the road????
18362,"They’re parents, not scorekeepers????"
18363,Blows my mind.
18364,If people don’t want to take financial responsibility for raising a child…wear a condom.
18365,Do not pay it!
18366,!
18367,"Unless you and your mom had written (maaaybe verbal) agreement to some of those expenses, don’t do a thing with it."
18368,"It’s okay if this hurts, allow yourself to grieve the loss of a maternal figure."
18369,"She may be alive, but that’s not the type of relationship you have with her."
18370,You can utilize Gestalt letter-writing technique about your thoughts/feelings of the situation.
18371,"You can then either destroy the letter, keep it, or send it if you choose."
18372,The therapy is primarily in the writing.
18373,"No one deserves to have parents like that and I hope you have better, more stable, people in your life now."
18374,"I wouldn’t pay it back, if they gave you money and y’all didn’t sign any agreements, you don’t owe them anything."
18375,"Out of principal, they don’t deserve to be paid back by doing this kind of sneaky shit."
18376,You don't ever owe your parents a dime for giving you anything needed or not.
18377,You didn't ask to be their child.
18378,They are adults that made a decision.
18379,I am so sorry they're acting like this but you owe them NOTHING.
18380,"I know you're probably not okay, but i hope you're able to get past it because this isn't a YOU problem."
18381,This is a THEM problem.
18382,If it were me I'd burn it and tell them they'll get their money on February 30th.
18383,"r/raisedbynarcissists moment right here
Also I hope you aren't planning on giving them a penny ever again."
18384,"Depends on how old you are when the money came in, 29 or younger...possibly a gift."
18385,"30 or older, pull up your big boy pants and pay for the computers, walmart and Netflix yourself and pay them the money."
18386,I will be your new pop-op.
18387,"I require no money, only a ""world's best dad"" apron to wear while I work the clean burning propane barbecue."
18388,Buy 2 [fn] dragonlore 4x titan(holo) kato 2014
18389,The only time I’ve ever heard of *anything* like this was in The Simpson’s when Principal Skinner said he didn’t have much money because he* was still paying his mother back for food he ate as a child!
18390,"r/randomsimpsons 


(*And it wasn’t even him, Tamzarian was a good soldier)"
18391,My god that’s rough.
18392,"The audacity is absolutely exceptional, it’s one of them situations where it’s so astoundingly shocking that you just have to laugh it off, I’d personally be breaking contact from them for that sort of behaviour, they’d never get a penny or an ounce of my time from then on in."
18393,To rub it in the face even more I’d send them a receipt of a donation made on their behalf to a charity of the exact same amount.
18394,(Subject to actually the amount of money you came into of course).
18395,"Oh, man."
18396,"An invoice... Welp, looks like you'll have to pay."
18397,Make sure you get a copy of the contracts you signed before you start paying though.
18398,You have to validate the signatures.
18399,I will never understand this as a parent of three who works everyday of the week to hope to build generational wealth I just can’t be mad my kids got some dough.
18400,That’s kind of the point have and raise productive independent children and then hope u can leave ur family better off then when u became head of the family so to speak.
18401,My whole life revolves around making money I may never spend in an attempt to pull my entire family out of poverty.
18402,And then - Accepting this twisted scenario - what happens when you ‘pay this debt off’ what - your business together is done?
18403,"They have been paid for raising you, so no further contact needed?"
18404,As a parent with grown adult kids I would never think of sending them something like this.
18405,I am sorry my man..
18406,I have a dad who is pulling this same thing on me right now.
18407,Here's what has helped me.
18408,"If and when you come into money, only tell family that would be genuinely happy for you."
18409,Not the ones who see you as a source of free money.
18410,I hope you find peace in this messed up situation.
18411,Don't give them a dollar.
18412,I'm so sorry this happened to you OP.
18413,Adult relationships with your parents can be very difficult to navigate when they have money problems.
18414,I'm living that life as well but I will say this is on a nother level.
18415,I hope your mother realizes how fucked up this is and you two can repair the damage done.
18416,Write them a letter back telling them how awful this letter is.
18417,Give them a choice between 25k or having you in their life.
18418,"If they choose you, never give them a cent."
18419,"Not a mom, but this popped up in my feed."
18420,"I don’t have the healthiest relationship with my parents, but since I’ve started doing well for myself, they haven’t pulled anything like this on me."
18421,"I’m sorry, bud."
18422,"People shouldn’t treat their children like high yield investments, hoping they make their money back (and more, fucking interest???)"
18423,off of them.
18424,"I’m sure you love them, but I hope you recognize this as awful."
18425,I hope you don’t fault yourself for it.
18426,"You’re not an asset, you’re their kid."
18427,"That’s good enough, dude."
18428,I think a nice “I didn’t ask to be born” teenager response would justified in this situation
18429,Dear god!!!
18430,When I had my son I accepted the cost there and then.
18431,I would never expect me to pay me back other than sending a card on my birthday lol.
18432,I am sorry to see this.
18433,Don’t pay it!!!!
18434,Not even a cent.
18435,Otherwise she will come for more.
18436,"Respond with “no thanks, good luck with retirement”"
18437,This is my worse fear.
18438,I am SO sorry
18439,Either I can’t read her writing but she’s charged you for Google??
18440,Am I reading that right?
18441,What a garbage mom.
18442,I’d cut off all ties with my mom if she ever sent me a list.
18443,I am sorry you have to deal with this.
18444,I had a very similar thing happen with my mom.
18445,I got sick with a kidney disease at 15.
18446,"I tried to work, go to collage, etc."
18447,; and had issues with health where I couldn't last.
18448,My parents helped me financially often for that reason.
18449,"I ended up married with my daughters on the way, and I got disability due to my disease and inability to work."
18450,My mother wanted me to pay her back for things she paid for to help me as I struggled to be on my own.
18451,It was my father that stepped in and stopped her.
18452,My father told her it was their duty to help me in need.
18453,I had a family now to think of and care for.
18454,"And I should use my pack pay for my family, not to pay them back anything."
18455,"I also want to add my father was making 100K- 80K roughly a year, and my mother was making 25k- 60K in the time frame of my help."
18456,Dad was working upper management in a company over transportation section till the business side collapsed and then he went to help run a smaller transportation company.
18457,"Mother was college educated and went from a private sector rehab counselor job, to drug prevention with a government agency."
18458,"And she wanted me to pay back rent for 3-4 months, and help with other bills in that time period."
18459,"Along with ""other"" things....

&#x200B;

I suggest to you two things."
18460,"One, if your parents are in need of help, do so."
18461,"But not in the amount ""mother"" is asking."
18462,"Second, talk with both parents."
18463,Father might not know nothing.
18464,"And if so, he could be very mad over this."
18465,"Also I would suggest saying you have no issue helping out, but when it comes to paying things back for raising you as ""mother"" is demanding is out of the question."
18466,And as such is also extremally hurtful to think your parents want money back for being your parents.
18467,"But also state you have no issue with helping out since you want to if needed, but not because it is being demanded or required."
18468,OP— here is an idea for a sassy reply (if you feel like being sassy).
18469,Reply with a bill for charging them for care for when they are elderly.
18470,If they view taking care of a dependent family member as a financial loan—then let them have it.
18471,"Let them know you won’t take care of them, unless they pay you."
18472,"(Except if you do that, that is fair."
18473,What they did to you is a million times worse.
18474,You were a CHILD.
18475,Parents are supposed to pay the expenses to take care of their children.
18476,That’s the law.
18477,It’s also the only morally correct thing to do.
18478,You didn’t sign up for these expenses— they did.
18479,"If they didn’t want these expenses, they shouldn’t have had a kid.)"
18480,Taking care of these horrible excuses for “parents” in their old age is being too merciful.
18481,"Clearly these monsters don’t view a family relationship as family, they view it as business."
18482,(Worse: non-consensual business they’re enforcing on a child that they brought into the world.
18483,The kid never signed up for these expenses.)
18484,If these people view “taking care of a dependent family member person” as a business transaction—then business transactions they shall indeed have.
18485,I would charge them if they ask me to take care of them in their elderly years.
18486,"You charged me rent, food, utilities, care, etc, for when I was a child and unable to work, you expect to get paid for taking care of me when I was able to work."
18487,Fair is fair.
18488,"I expect to get paid for taking care of you, when you are unable to work."
18489,"Except you requesting to charge them money to take care of family is 100x nicer and more legal, because at least it is legal to give loans and financial contracts to adults."
18490,You cannot do that to a child.
18491,Especially without consent.
18492,"It’s like kidnapping someone, holding them hostage for 18 years, and then expecting them to pay all the expenses acquired during that time frame they were there against their will."
18493,"Like, ummmm, I didn’t ask to be here."
18494,"I’ll say here what I said there: 

Your reply should be a very short “lol :)”

If she asks why you said that, say, “It’s normal to reply ‘lol’ when someone makes a joke, and this, clearly, is a joke.” 

If she insists she’s being serious, say (in a light, laughing tone), “I mean, you’re dedicated to the bit!"
18495,"I’m gonna tell everyone about the funny joke invoice my mom sent, trying to bill me for the normal cost of raising a child."
18496,The thing that parents decide to do when having a baby.
18497,Of their own free will.
18498,Over which the child has no say.
18499,…They’re gonna laugh as hard as I’m laughing!
18500,"Seriously, this is hilarious."
18501,Gotta run!”
18502,Nope.
18503,Absolutely not.
18504,"Bye, mom and dad, we’re done here."
18505,"Nope, I wouldn’t want money for being a mom I decided to have kids which means they’re my responsibility to take care of."
18506,This is awful.
18507,I’m wondering if your parents are religious in any way?
18508,The fact that they kept track of all this is horrifying.
18509,The fact that they kept track while you were a child is worse.
18510,The fact that they are charging interest when you never agreed to loan terms is illegal but also evil.
18511,"I would put some distance between yourself and them for a while, if not for good."
18512,"i’m so sorry, she is beyond wrong to do this."
18513,Yikes!
18514,Talk about money grabbing!
18515,"Am I just crazy or are you being charged for ""google"" several times?"
18516,So many questions....
18517,I’d like to have a talk with your mother.
18518,Sorry not sorry.
18519,What a horrible thing to do to your child.
18520,Block ‘em this is crazy.
18521,You deserve better!
18522,I am late to the thread but my heart is breaking for you.
18523,Who does this?
18524,I can’t conceive of “keeping score” like this.
18525,This feels like it comes from fear.
18526,"As in she is so scared of being homeless or having to eat cat food that this was some
sort of weird coping tactic."
18527,"If you can stand it,I’d talk to her about it."
18528,"If she is adamant and just goes with “you OWE me” 
I’d pay her but break off any and all contact."
18529,Because this is deeply disturbing.
18530,"Best of luck,OP."
18531,..and have this little award thing.
18532,I like how she typed out the letter part but then gave the budget writing job to a blind chicken with a pencil taped to one leg.
18533,"Hmm... not to be disrespectful or anything..

Tell them to kick rocks and write it off to the game."
18534,"✍️  

You'll have to take me out if you want that money if yanno what I'm saying😌 #lifeinsurance

As I sit ahead on most bills but playing catch up on a few."
18535,Seriously.
18536,🤣
18537,What even is this?
18538,Darling.
18539,I saw your original post.
18540,It's helpful seeing the full thing because that handwriting alone gives me the heebie jeebies.
18541,Such a shaky hand she can't write a 1 straight.
18542,Anyway.
18543,You deserved to have parents who love you unconditionally.
18544,Love is not just a contract.
18545,Parents are not supposed to get something back at the end of the day.
18546,As a mom you give and you give and the only thing you ask for in return is love.
18547,Not money.
18548,The only parents who ever expect things back from their child are abusing and selfish.
18549,It sounds like your wife and her parents are wonderful people.
18550,I hope you can meet up with them soon and share with them how all of this is making you feel.
18551,"I really really hope they can, with time, become like parents to you."
18552,Because I know in my soul you deserve better.
18553,Speak to a lawyer with your wife present.
18554,An initial consultation should not be too expensive.
18555,Having some professional advice will also help you feel a bit more solid about this.
18556,You are not going to pay one cent of that.
18557,You don't owe them anything.
18558,If they are going to treat you like a cash cow they don't even deserve your attention.
18559,"It's sad, because if they hadn't done this, maybe you would have bought them nice gifts at Christmas time."
18560,Maybe you could have bought a holiday for them in return.
18561,Now they will get nothing.
18562,Their greed and disrespect for you is palpable.
18563,Hope you are getting lots of hugs at the moment.
18564,Make sure to hold them for 15 seconds for your body to register it properly.
18565,"It's okay to cry about this, because you've been betrayed."
18566,"It's okay to laugh about this, because it's ridiculous."
18567,"It's okay to be angry about this, because they don't have the right."
18568,"It's okay to be embarrassed about this, it's a little humiliating."
18569,But it's not okay to let them win.
18570,Not this time.
18571,Wow.
18572,I can understand a parent asking or even borrowing money from their child when things are rough.
18573,But this is next level.
18574,Your mum has been keeping a tally and sent you an itemized bill??
18575,"You need to go NC or very LC with them, for your own sanity."
18576,This doesn't sound normal at all.
18577,Sending you many hugs!
18578,This is unreal.
18579,"I would understand if they are going through a rough spot to ask you for a loan, or straight up to gift them money..."
18580,But back charging you for spending money raising you?
18581,That's just cruel.
18582,Parent-child is not a transactional relationship.
18583,"I'm sorry they somehow thought this was an appropriate approach to the matter.They are the parents, it was their duty to raise you and provide for you."
18584,It would be nice to get some acknowledgement and appreciation afterwards as gifts or monetary help once you are independent and in a position to provide it.
18585,This is absurdly appalling.
18586,Hugs OP.
18587,I cannot imagine sending my children a bill for ANYTHING.
18588,I am so sorry!
18589,"Hey sibling,

I don't think they have any right to do that."
18590,"Parents take care of the child out of their own volition, it's nothing a child have any say in."
18591,"Plus, they do that because that's what LAW requires of them."
18592,"You'd need to check that, buy I highly doubt they have any grounds to enforce you to pay that off."
18593,Oh honey I’m so sorry.
18594,"A child is a gift, the cost of which is impossible to calculate."
18595,I’m sorry your abuser cannot see how much of an amazing child she had.
18596,I’m so proud of you.
18597,Despite your abusive childhood look how amazing you turned out.
18598,"You’re successful and sounds like have a healthy, loving relationship with your wife!"
18599,You seem like a kind and empathetic person.
18600,That is an incredible feat.
18601,"I’m so glad you came into money, that will be such a great think for you and your wife."
18602,A loving mother would be relieved and happy that her child is going to have such a good financial situation in their 20s.
18603,You’re going to get through this.
18604,❤️❤️❤️
18605,I’m so sorry you are going through this.
18606,It’s insulting.
18607,Bewildering.
18608,Hugs to you.
18609,I would certainly not pay this.
18610,While you process this- don’t let anyone know you have money.
18611,It’s a private matter.
18612,This too shall pass.
18613,It will get better.
18614,This definitely belongs on r/insaneparents too
18615,I’m so sorry.

18618,I can’t imagine EVER asking for even a fraction of this from my parents
18619,I’m sorry you’re going through this.
18620,"I wish I had advice for you, but I don’t."
18621,"It might not be a bad idea to hire a lawyer, Though."
18622,They even included interest 💀💀💀💀
18623,[removed]
18624,OP is looking at this wrong.
18625,"Neglecting your parents is a crime, so this might be a good opportunity to pay the parents off before shit gets REALLY expensive."
18626,I feel like a complete dick for typing this and for thinking it’s funny.
18627,.
18628,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKwt6bvnmew
18629,Same thing happened with me.
18630,I ended up giving half of what they asked for to preserve the relationship.
18631,"Legally, are you obligated to pay this in any way what so ever?"
18632,100% agree.
18633,This is about as clear of a flag as you will ever get.
18634,I am still processing.
18635,"Oddly enough, readily 10,000+ “voices” saying that the situation was awful helped a lot."
18636,"I don’t think I am okay, but I am not feeling it yet."
18637,Does that make sense?
18638,What the FRESH HECK?!
18639,"This comment warmed me right up from the inside, what a lovely thing."
18640,"I'm gonna call my mom right now, damn."
18641,and from as far back as 2015!!
18642,that’s ridiculous
18643,"The smiley face threw me off so far, I though it was her giving HIM money"
18644,"OP is 27, to me it seems like they took out a college loan for them."
18645,OP would be around 19-20 in 2014
18646,How do you know that?
18647,I'd love know more details but can only see the final paragraph and the sign off.
18648,[deleted]
18649,Already posted there; got locked as it isn’t a text message.
18650,"My dad said he'll ""get back"" the money by me spending my money on my son, like a pay it forward thing... and sure enough, he's right."
18651,"I remember wasting his money, and now my son ""really wanted"" those super expensive glasses... and the two hundred dollar retainers he swears he'll use (never used, teeth went back lol)... e.t.c, blah, blah, blah."
18652,"Figure eventually my kid will be spoiling my future grandkids and I can sit back and be like ""chyea, they didnt really need those hologram xbox gogo trap sites now did they?!"""
18653,Lmao
18654,"Children are brought into the world against their will, by their parents decision."
18655,Paying for everything they need until they are an adult is part of having one.
18656,Exactly.
18657,My only hope is that I raised my kids well enough and with enough love and support that they will let me live with them when I'm too old rather than stick me in a home.
18658,"It was on the front page of that sub yesterday, can’t double up ya know"
18659,"I mean if your kids get rich enough then some sharing isn't out of the question imo, but it's always optional and never in a way like this"
18660,"Already planned on it (they didn’t know this), but now I am unsure."
18661,Lol time to gift her something expensive and then sending her the invoice straight from the shop
18662,"I am terrible with understanding handwritten texts, and maybe understood 30% of this, but I was able to identify the word google, so I was convinced I was misreading and did like four double takes to be sure."
18663,Wtf?
18664,It seems like op had been using the parents cc.
18665,Look at the square charged and what not.
18666,This looks like someone who had turned 18+ and used the parents credit cards for personal reasons without paying them back.
18667,ie they literally went through months and years of statements to justify any charge to milk you for each and every penny to ease their (lack of) conscience
18668,I feel much more free after cutting contact.
18669,"Dad was an abusive drunk, mom was a gaslighting manipulative bitch, and brother suffered from addiction because my dad partied with him and couldn't care less for his well being."
18670,It was the best decision I ever made.
18671,"I don't care about how they are because they continue to do things out of spite against me, like when my grandmother died they weren't going to call me."
18672,"And my dad somehow ""forgot"" I was her favorite grandchild after joking about it for years when I was home."
18673,I had to hear by text that she died.
18674,I didn't even feel comfortable going to the funeral because of them and that will bother me the rest of my life.
18675,Take my faux 🥇 this is the answer
18676,Set the cap at the cost of an abortion she should have had.
18677,Nope; since childhood.
18678,"Interest started when I was 18, stopped when I started college, then began again when I graduated (2014)."
18679,[removed]
18680,Decades.
18681,Like this goes back until the age of roughly 9 (also roughly the time when she left work).
18682,"So, she had been, allegedly, keeping receipts since I was 9."
18683,I am now convinced that she determined that she hated me at that age and saw me as a simple way to make money/pay for their retirement.
18684,That’s like especially crazy
18685,"But who set the interest rate and could you have gotten a broker to find you a better set of lenders, er, parents?"
18686,Oh nice one lol
18687,Pleaaaase ask your mother this
18688,My wife is encouraging me to talk to my therapist about this.
18689,I posted to Reddit as I still do not know how to process this.
18690,"Due to years of abuse, some sick voice in me is saying, “well, they did raise you…”."
18691,Glad to have her by my side.
18692,"I read some of your previous comments and got the from-50,000-feet-POV."
18693,"First, you'll still get a warm hug plus your dad & I will feed you & your wife dinner twice a week or more; second, don't ever pay your egg donor a cent, it's horrific that she even expected you to and that her spouse won't stand up to her; third, I'm so proud you got the rank of Eagle Scout; fourth, go incommunicado with your egg donor and give yourself peace of mind; lastly, you have a great wife who is a wonderful champion for your well-being."
18694,"My spouse & I don't have kids, although we had planned on raising a family and I've always loved children, except life works in mysterious ways - believe me, no decent mum would even think for a moment that sending an invoice for doing what is morally required of parents is normal or acceptable."
18695,"I'm sure many of us are lining up to be your mum, so feel the love."
18696,"❤️ I'll send you a weekly pulse check if you want me to make sure you are ok and I promise, you'll never get an invoice of any sort from me."
18697,I learned this term recently from a pastor friend I have: My parents are CEO Christians.
18698,Christmas and Easter Only.
18699,Nope.
18700,Between the ages of 9 and when I graduated college.
18701,"Boy Scout trips, gas money for dates when I was 16, annualized estimates for room and board between 9 and 18 (when I officially moved out), college dorm (tuition was free), the time I got a speeding ticket at 17… Everything."
18702,"Interest began at 18, stopped when I began college, and started again (unbeknownst to me) after I graduated."
18703,Google is on that list.
18704,No idea why.
18705,"Last time I checked, Google was free."
18706,At least Nook was cute and didn’t charge interest.
18707,The irony is that any good child with decent parents (sometimes not even decent parents) would absolutely gift their parents some money if they came into a very large sum.
18708,"It’s kinda just natural, and it seems like OP was ready to do that themselves."
18709,Then the mom decided the gift wasn’t coming quick enough I guess lmao.
18710,Fuck people like this.
18711,Funny thing?
18712,"I was sharing a Netflix account with them at the time, but apparently it was MY Netflix account all along."
18713,28
18714,All.
18715,Of.
18716,This.
18717,It’s a photocopy of pencil otherwise I would be 100% with you!
18718,Yes to the loans.
18719,Come on.
18720,Pay those back.
18721,I was starting to think I was crazy.
18722,It seems like these are all expenses (and mostly big ones at that) in which the parents covered it.
18723,"Netflix might be a bit petty, but the cars definitely are not."
18724,Plus there's a ton on here that is blacked out.
18725,"Interest isn't entirely fair if it hasn't been agreed upon, but I agree that op should be paying back these expenses."
18726,"It looks like most of the expenses listed are things the parents paid when OP was ages 9 to about age 21, judging from comments."
18727,The only items charged in the last 7 years are “interest” for those childhood and college expenses.
18728,"If you look at OP’s other comments, he said that the bill is from the ages of nine through 18, and the interest was charged after he turned 18, his parents are awful people."
18729,Because it was meticulously documented.
18730,"Rather than saying “College dorm”, she listed the building."
18731,"Rather than writing “Boy Scout Trip”, she listed the troop number and the campsite."
18732,"Rather than “Annual Food Estimate”, she listed the name of the local chain where she purchased the food when I lived there."
18733,Lots of things that could easily identify me as an individual.
18734,"The entire invoice was age 9 to 20; interest began anytime I was not in school (18 - 18.5, 20 - present)."
18735,"I had a deer destroy my car, they held my insurance, they paid the deductible."
18736,"Every time I got gas money for dates when I was 16, every Boy Scout Trip, field trip, estimates for groceries and board between 9 to 18, everything is in here."
18737,My father has a roughly $2MM retirement account.
18738,"They live in a 6,000sqft McMansion."
18739,They were talking about moving to Florida and really wanted a beach-side house.
18740,"When they originally began talking about this (September, before my money came), this seemed like an easy math assignment."
18741,"Sell the large house, use that money to buy a smaller 3-bedroom house on the beach."
18742,"My father liked that idea, my mother was distressed as it wasn’t enough space for her antiques."
18743,I believe that desire for the beach McMansion upgrade was the catalyst for this invoice.
18744,"That, and the deep seated resentment she apparently feels towards me."
18745,[deleted]
18746,50k was grocery estimate between age 9 and 18.
18747,"It was listed as a local, identifiable chain, hence the redaction."
18748,"When I was 16, I worked as a graphic designer."
18749,They got me the laptop for Christmas.
18750,The car was my father’s and got it when I was 16 as well.
18751,"It died (head gasket), so I was “gifted” another one (~$1,700)."
18752,This is really your take?
18753,Is it also your culture to try and subtley put others down and miss the point of a post?
18754,I felt the same way.
18755,"My family was broke as hell so I got a job at 16 to buy clothes, furniture for my bedroom, stuff my mum couldn’t afford."
18756,She couldn’t even buy me a Tupperware box for my food.
18757,It was always my wish to take care of her one day.
18758,I wonder why OP’s mother went about it in this way.
18759,Why did she feel this was an appropriate way to ask for some money?
18760,Nobody owes their parents anything.
18761,It’s your choice to help your mother.
18762,She can’t demand anything for having and raising you.
18763,"She chose to have a baby, no one chooses to be born."
18764,"First, who pays for porn?"
18765,"Second, I redacted identifiable stores to the small town."
18766,"window lighting, avoid bright light sources"

^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)"
18769,"Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`"
18770,time and place...
18771,Why would you want to preserve the relationship with someone that charged you for your upbringing?
18772,They chose to have you and they charged you for that.
18773,"That’s saying you were born into indentured servitude, like a slave."
18774,Extortion for parental love?
18775,"Fuck so many people in this thread and their greedy, grubby parents."
18776,Wtf?
18777,Wow.
18778,This is just awful.
18779,I’m truly sorry that your mom sent this to you.
18780,There is a silver lining here to consider:  she just defined your relationship as a transaction.
18781,It’s no different from when you go to a store and pay for a good or service.
18782,"When you receive a faulty product or a bad service, you are well within your rights to refuse payment."
18783,"It’s also helpful to remember that we do not generally invite the salespeople, checkout attendants Or waitstaff (or anyone else involved in some commercial transaction) into our homes, into our personal lives, into our holidays, etc."
18784,and we don’t really think twice about it (or even feel guilty about it for that matter).
18785,As sad as it it…and it truly is…this is a gift.
18786,She clearly defined the relationship for you.
18787,Please believe her when she tells you that she’s nothing more than the person on the other side of a financial transaction.
18788,And then refuse payment for awful service.
18789,Then you can begin the hard work of the grieving process.
18790,"Hang in there, kiddo!"
18791,Sending hugs and love your way❤️
18792,This is 100% a thing where a mom might hope secretly you would decide to shower her with $ after knowing that you had come into a bunch of it… but a mom sending an invoice to their child??
18793,A child she chose to give those things to?!?
18794,"Nah… if she didn’t make an agreement all those times that she was only LOANING you money, then those were gifts, and it’s super messed up to ask for gifts to be given back"
18795,"Yes, it makes sense."
18796,"If a place as mean as the internet has your back, it can help you start to process things."
18797,Something as big as this might take some time before your feelings can catch up.
18798,You take your time.
18799,"Yeah my parents did something similar and I said  “fine sue me and good luck without a contract and me being a minor when many of these costs were incurred, a minor you didn’t fully inform to make it a viable verbal contract.” 

Don’t pay that shit back that’s petty as Fuck."
18800,Plus you’ll be the one taking care of them in their old age paying out of pocket because they didn’t account for rising costs of care
18801,"At first I was reading it like ""oh, just 1xx dollars"" this is okay, but I realized my fault when I looked through what she actually wrote down."
18802,I would have accepted if it was for a repair or something got broken and needed to get bought new again.
18803,But look at what she actually stated there.
18804,It's not even like you caused it or are responsible for ther fatal householding.
18805,"Keep your money for yourself and ""your"" family."
18806,"Take some days off with your wife and tell your mother ""sorry mom I can't do this"", we have put this in a safe spot for our kids so we can pay for college."
18807,"If you don't have kids yet, it's for the ""someday"" kids you are planning to have one day."
18808,Be a dick like her.
18809,Jumping in to say: DO NOT PAY THEM A PENNY.
18810,"In some places, agreeing to any payment is an acceptance of their terms."
18811,Don’t pay them shit for being shit.
18812,Hijacking top comment to reply to yours.
18813,SHOOT HER BACK A PREINSTALLMENT FOR HER RETIREMENT HOME EXPENSES.
18814,If she wants to play this game you can easily shoot back an equally rediculous letter.
18815,How is she gonna pull this shit when in reality it's her ass that's on the line.
18816,"I'd charge her for emotional trauma, future retirement home budgets, and for sure visits during her stay at the old folks home."
18817,She wants to charge for maternal love?
18818,Well that means you get to charge for giving them attention and comfort when they're too old not to accidentally soil themselves.
18819,*Plus OP I hope you're doing okay.
18820,"Money truly makes people show their true colors, and it sucks when it uncovers aweful things in people you thought you knew."
18821,*
18822,Block them and never talk to them again.
18823,I swear toxic family will never change.
18824,I’m so angry for you.
18825,"I know you’re shaken right now, but I know that deep down you too know that what she did was so messed up, otherwise I don’t think you would’ve asked."
18826,This is unquestionably messed up.
18827,It takes a lot to accept that your parents and your your experiences aren’t normal.
18828,I know I was and still am in a sort of denial.
18829,"It was seven years ago, I was 14 or 15 but I knew something was deeply wrong even back then."
18830,Lean on your supportive spouse and trust yourself.
18831,"You don’t need to accept it right away, you don’t need to overthink it, but always trust yourself and your intuition"
18832,Reverse it and give ‘em an invoice for all the emotional abuse.
18833,I don’t know your situation beyond what you have posted.
18834,"I do understand abusive parents like this, glad you got a boost in life, hope those funds help."
18835,Op: Is your mom an N-mom btw?
18836,(Narcissist) mom?
18837,"Only asking bc my own mother pulls this shit with us kids, me, lil bro, and sis."
18838,And when my brother passed away unexpectedly she pulled out this budgeted sheet and demanded to be paid back the money he owed her out of his estate.
18839,"(Mind you he was in serious debt had a home about it be foreclosed on, had no life insurance policy, nothing to bury himself with, and most accident money went to his two very young children from a previous short marriage)."
18840,My mother demanding to be paid back from my brother DYING and pulling this crap with my sister and I proved how much of a n-mom we have.
18841,and she’s aparently got a tally going on both me and my sister too for all the “years we lived at home”.
18842,That’s some care right?
18843,Heh.
18844,This was something she Apparently learnt from HER mother (her mother did it to her and them too) and I swear to high heavens I am NOT pulling this on my own two children.
18845,I love them more then saddling them with failure as a parent (debt) their lives.
18846,Money can make some people temporarily insane.
18847,I’d tel her off for that one and give her an out from the oncoming embarrassment she hopefully feels.
18848,A response you might use here is the fact that if she hadn't paid to raise you she'd be in jail.
18849,She can't charge you for keeping the law.
18850,She was legally required to take care of you.
18851,"If my parents tried to recoup what they've spent on me during my upbringing, I'd reply with a printed letter with a single word: ""lol."""
18852,"Incidentally, my parents have indeed tried to make me feel as if I owed them somehow for them taking care of me, to which I replied ""that's not how it works."
18853,"You took care of me, I'll take care of my kids  and my kids will take of their kids."
18854,"So... you can stop with that argument now."""
18855,Sweetie it completely makes sense.
18856,It hurts when our parents show us we're aren't or never were a priority.
18857,It will come and go your feelings about this.
18858,Realizing my parents were more harmful than good in my life took time.
18859,It's the 5 stages of grief because you are getting the relationship you don't have and deserve.
18860,It will take time and be gentle weight with yourself.
18861,100% remember you don't owe them any money for raising you.
18862,They chose to have a child/children.
18863,Part of it is the costs of raising them.
18864,I am so sorry your parents are behaving this way.
18865,It makes complete sense!
18866,And I want you to know this is so completely awful of your mom.
18867,I'm an adult with a kid and I've loaned money from my parents when money is tight or something expensive comes up.
18868,My dad NEVER lets me pay him back even though I try.
18869,He is always just happy to help and see me healthy and happy.
18870,Tells me I'm only allowed to pay him by spending more time with him.
18871,I couldn't imagine dealing with this and I'm so incredibly sorry that you have to.
18872,I'm glad your wife is being supportive and showing you that you deserve better.
18873,🤗 first and foremost.
18874,Give your hugs from me too.
18875,"Now, imma let my mamma bear out."
18876,Don’t let her make you feel bad or selfish or guiltily what this bull shit letter.
18877,"I can’t imagine charging my 22 y/o like that, and he’s bipolar- hell I should get a star - anyway untangle any shared legal dealings and then block her."
18878,"I salted and burned my family tree in 12/17, km still not ok, lean on your tribe, that’s what they are there for."
18879,"It’s hard, but better in the long run."
18880,Proud of how maturely you are dealing with this
18881,Deleted
18882,Hows your relationship with them?
18883,If they are good parents and are down on their luck explain why it hurt you and help them out if you can.
18884,If they are terrible parents send them a bill for all the bull shot they put you threw ...just because reddit says something doesn't male it true
18885,Send back a written note that just says “k” and then never respond again
18886,"Send her an invoice back for providing ""child experience"" for $117k + interest"
18887,"you never signed a contract, so they ain't got anything for a court to see."
18888,"I know its your mom and all, but its a parents responsibility to their child to raise them, no matter how much it costs."
18889,so in short... tell them to go fuck themselves.
18890,It goes back to 2003.
18891,Interest began in 2014.
18892,"That is when the interest began, not the expenses."
18893,Expenses began in roughly 2004
18894,There’s 4 photos.
18895,Swipe left.
18896,Oh I saw their other post in a different subreddit and the OP responded to some other people.
18897,They made a “bill” for a bunch of expenses in childhood and only started charging interest from the time they turned 18 if I am understanding correctly (I believe they said they were either 26 or 28 right now).
18898,"So like $102,000 for childhood expenses and like $14,000 total or so in “interest” for the time the bill wasn’t paid after age 18."
18899,That’s assuming I am understanding the posts correctly
18900,Oh wow I wasn't a aware that sub was only texts.
18901,That's ridiculous.
18902,r/raisedbynarcissists?
18903,r/entitledparents is a good one lol
18904,...
18905,"Isn't it just an analog text, though?"
18906,I think it should totally count!
18907,You can always post it in r/narcissisticparents too if that applies to you.
18908,Those kinds of arbitrary rules and the people they follow them hurt my brain.
18909,The message is literally text.
18910,Mods there are dumb.
18911,But it is a text message.
18912,It's handwritten text on paper and it's a message
18913,So…counter-offer.
18914,"Tell your mom she can have the $116,000 now, when they can still take care of themselves, or they can be taken care of at the end of their life when they *actually* really need it."
18915,"Tell her if you have to pay her this now, you’ll have no option but to put them in a “Home” later (retirement home, old people facility where you abandon your parents)."
18916,"Regardless of any truth to this, it might make her shut the fuck up a little bit."
18917,"The standard rules for paying back your parents are as follows: you change my diapers, I change yours; unless you suck."
18918,"From this point on, you have the upper hand."
18919,Don’t let your parents forget that.
18920,Or just stop talking to them and they’ll figure it out when they turn 80 lol do what’s healthy for you
18921,"Try r/raisedbynarcissists

Your invoice will blend in very well there"
18922,"My father once told me that if he’d only slammed his dick in the door, when he was seventeen, he’d be a millionaire."
18923,Your father sounds nice.
18924,Hologram Xbox gogo trap sites!
18925,Omg I'm dead.
18926,This is the way.
18927,"You raise your kids so that if they come into money, they *want* to spend some on you."
18928,The funny thing is that I was planning on helping them out.
18929,Literally was working on the tax stuff as you can’t easily give someone thousands of dollars without also giving them a major tax bill.
18930,"That being said, there are methodologies you can use to do this."
18931,"Buy a house, in your name, and let them stay there for a $1/mo., set up a trust, etc.."
18932,Exactly.
18933,I make way more than my parents and help them out a lot... and yet they always want to help me out.
18934,Oh sweetie.
18935,"I hate to say this, but don’t do it."
18936,"She’ll just invoice you again for more money, and keep doing it until you have no more to give."
18937,Edit: fixed wording
18938,Ouch that just makes it even worse.
18939,It's so passive agressive to give your child an invoice like this and just be like 🤭xoxo Mom.
18940,"This is seriously messed up and what is she talking about that 100,000 might not be a lot to you."
18941,What!?
18942,Didn't you just get this money recently!?
18943,You know it sucks because I've heard that coming into money will show you very quickly who really cares about you and who just wants to use you.
18944,"I'm sorry, you don't deserve that kind of treatment."
18945,Don’t do it!
18946,Don’t reward this type of entitlement!
18947,I came into a small amount of money and decided to just buy people stuff (that they wanted) instead of giving them money.
18948,It worked better all the way round.
18949,"It didn't go for bills, alcohol, cigs or drugs."
18950,Just stuff they wanted.
18951,More like giving presents.
18952,:)
18953,That’s what I was thinking!
18954,"That if I came into a lot of money I would WANT to give my parents some, but that want would absolutely disappear if they ASKED for it as payment for RAISING ME."
18955,It would be one thing if they asked to like pay off a debt but for presents?
18956,Awful.
18957,Please don't.
18958,"I mean honestly, they don't *deserve* anything now."
18959,"No one, no matter how much money the kid ends up having, and how poor the parents end up being, no kid **owes** their parents a single penny for raising them."
18960,"If a parent and child has a good relationship, and the kid comes into a large sum of money, a reasonable person would assume that the kid would *gift* them some money, but it certainly wouldn't be *owed* to them."
18961,"Another reason not to give them anything now is this:

>My attorney says if I pay a single dollar, I am accepting the bill."
18962,"I can't imagine a judge looking at someone and telling them *""Hey remember when you were a baby and needed diapers?"
18963,Remember all those clothes and shoes you needed growing up?
18964,Remember all the soap and water you needed to take baths as a kid?
18965,Remember all those birthday and Christmas presents your parents got you throughout your life?
18966,"Guess what son, every cent your parents spent on you growing up, now you owe that back to them!"
18967,"""* I know IANAL, but I just can't imagine anyone in their right mind thinking that's right."
18968,"I saw that you and your wife are going to donate 90% of the money you received, and I also saw you talking about being abused as a child."
18969,(Which I'm so very sorry for btw!)
18970,"I'd take the $116k that you're mom wants, donate it to a charity for abused kids, and then send her the receipt telling her how you hope that money can help prevent some kids from going through what *you* had to go through, as a kid."
18971,"Send them a note:

Money I planned to gift you: 100k

Deductions for trauma: 99k

Shipping and handling: 1k


Grand total: 0"
18972,She proved shes unworthy of it.
18973,Your mom is supposed to have unconditional love for you.
18974,This is wildly conditional.
18975,"Sorry my friend, use it as a lesson to do right by your own kids in the future (should you have any)"
18976,I wouldn’t.
18977,This is just gross.
18978,I can’t believe they want you to pay back what they spent in your child hood.
18979,"That is not normal, not fair, and not legal."
18980,"It's your decision, but I hope you don't."
18981,Dont give them anything.
18982,Dont agree to anything where they can say there was a verbal agreement and they take you to court.
18983,Donate to a good cause in her name instead :)
18984,"Man, if you give her ANY money I’ll be seriously disappointed."
18985,"Reply that the distress you experienced at receiving the letter caused you emotional damages equal to the value of <entire sum> and graciously, you have called it even."
18986,Don't gift them anything.
18987,Just cut ties and move on.
18988,"Where I live, the government sends monthly a bit of money to the parents of a child that lives with them."
18989,"If that child's money exists where you live, how about you invoice her back."
18990,Please don't.
18991,Don't feed this unhealthy sense of entitlement.
18992,I'm sorry you're facing this.
18993,Don't let her emotionally blackmail you about this.
18994,We have your back.
18995,It needs to be a solid No now.
18996,Learn from this.
18997,You can't reward shitty behavior.
18998,[deleted]
18999,"Yeah, this was just wrong… my mom recently came into $$$, and of course there’s this human part in all of us that wishes we might get a little bit.. but a freaking invoice?"
19000,I’m worried about her.
19001,"Even if you paid this, it wouldn’t stop there."
19002,"She would guilt you into buying things for her and then nothing from you would ever be a true heartfelt gift to her, but just an obligation."
19003,It would deprive the giver and receiver of the true joy in doing good for others.
19004,"Thought… the most gracious one I can muster in response to her not deserving anything from you anyway, but especially after this..
if you were going to give her a larger sum than what is on this sheet anyway, then perhaps you can gift it to her with a carefully worded letter where you tell her this was the amount that you were planning to give to her anyway."
19005,"The invoice was pitiful and you’re worried about her mental health and your relationship, which you had hoped was built on love that didn’t revolve around keeping a financial score."
19006,But this (the original amount you intended to give her) will be the only money you will give her because you can see that the $ has gotten in the way of having a healthy relationship.
19007,"You will love her and still spend time as you did before, but you will never grant her any requests for money or gifts."
19008,"And your gift is not in any way a response to her asking you for $, because it took all your will not to deny her so much as a penny after she let money become more important than your relationship."
19009,The joy of the gift you wanted to give was gone the moment she made it a demand instead.
19010,Edit: I’ve definitely heard that getting $ makes a lot of people around you go crazy.
19011,Maybe be careful who you tell.
19012,"Hoping for a better result and sorry she was like that

Last Edit: I said the joy of the gift was gone the moment she made it a demand.. but really, the more I think about it, generosity is it’s own gift despite whether or not the receiver deserves it."
19013,It was so kind of you to want to give to her in the first place.
19014,NOTHING can undo the goodness of giving from a gracious heart.
19015,You rock.
19016,Please don't 🙏
19017,I agree with: Don’t!
19018,But if you *must* … $10k is sufficient.
19019,"“If I pay you this money, then I don’t owe you anything."
19020,"No visits on holidays, no visits with your grandchildren, etc."
19021,"If you still want the money over a relationship, let me know, I’m happy to pay it”"
19022,OP ....send them this reddit thread.
19023,People like this tend to be very socially unaware.
19024,Since they invoice you all of your childhood and cost of upbringing I would see 2 possibilities going forward.
19025,1.
19026,"You could pay the money and since you then ""cleared the debt"" of your childhood cut all ties to them after that, since you're not owing them anything after that."
19027,Literally nothing.
19028,And also tell your parents why you're paying the money.
19029,Or 2. you could choose to not pay it and leave it as it is?...
19030,"I'm not sure since I don't know what kind of relationship you have with them, but it does seem to be pretty toxic."
19031,"If you ever thought about cutting ties with them, but would feel guilty about it, because they still brought you up, that would be the ideal situation to clear your conscience and move on."
19032,You're owing them literally nothing after you've been through that.
19033,Make sure you let her know this at some point.
19034,"I’m sorry that this happened to you, op."
19035,No kid should be made to feel this way by their mother.
19036,Big hugs.
19037,Unsure?
19038,Why are you unsure?
19039,It should be a definitive no and I can guarantee you that you'd be risking your relationship with your wife if you did that
19040,I’m so sorry you’re having to experience all of these feelings.
19041,I’d strongly suggest not sending them anything now.
19042,People like this (I can relate very closely to your situation) are extremely toxic.
19043,This is not love.
19044,It’s not friendship.
19045,It will repeat with new “bills”.
19046,It will not ever satisfy the “you owe me” mentality.
19047,Parents shouldn’t ever expect their kids to pay them back.
19048,It’s absurd!
19049,"Plus, God forbid down the road you ever needed their help, it would always be a debt to repay, so put your money in savings and/or investments for your rainy days."
19050,Sending you 💜
19051,Don't.
19052,Donate the money you would have given them instead.
19053,My vote is that they get nothing.
19054,They're not genuinely caring it loving and deserve none of your kindness.
19055,Plus if you give them anything they'll feel entitled to more.
19056,Please don't.
19057,This is the biggest POS move I have seen in a long while.
19058,They don't deserve a single penny.
19059,"Save it for your own family holidays, and memories."
19060,Nope.
19061,Do not give them anything.
19062,They will use that to get more out of you.
19063,"You don’t owe them anything, but paying them something might open that door."
19064,"It’s hard to sit there when you know you’ll get judgement, for being ungrateful etc."
19065,"but if you pay thrm, you enable their behaviour saying “this is okay”
The pattern will get harder to break down the line."
19066,Greed has no limit.
19067,Absolutely don’t gift them any money.
19068,"If you are feeling extremely generous, buy them a nice gift but once and that’s it, but honestly, I wouldn’t do even that."
19069,Their greed has ruined all goodwill towards them.
19070,Nope.
19071,Not a cent!
19072,Don’t even give her any as a gift.
19073,She has clearly indicated who she is here.
19074,"When people come to spend YOUR money, that’s a blazing red flag."
19075,My littlest brother just came into millions from the sale of his company.
19076,We just had this conversation as a family with 10 siblings.
19077,None of us contributed to his gain and none of us are owed a dime.
19078,A big pile of money can make people crazy.
19079,"After much discussion where our narcissistic mother joyfully began to spend his new found wealth, she was shouted down."
19080,"As he says, we are all “grown ass adults” and can manage our own financial lives."
19081,"Now, he is not oblivious to the fact that she gave birth to him and raised him (even if it was with mostly benign neglect) so although he won’t give her a cent now, he did set up a trust for longterm care expenses for both her and our father."
19082,"Not out of appeasing our mother’s misguided feeling of entitlement, though."
19083,He did it to spare the other 9 from an expense that could bankrupt us.
19084,She has very little in savings and has several complex medical conditions that will likely mean a move to a nursing home at some point.
19085,Perhaps there’s a path there for you?
19086,"If you do feel that you should do something, maybe a longterm care trust is your answer as well?"
19087,"Hey man since you’re such a push over and don’t know how to stand up for yourself, you also owe me 116K."
19088,Yeah this seems overlooked.
19089,If he’s buying stuff on their card it’s more than normal that he pays back.
19090,"I’d be furious if he was invoiced for diapers and food during childhood but gas, tickets, squarespace, cars and computers.. that’s stuff you gotta pay for yourself as an adult."
19091,Invoicing like this is really fucking weird but it’s not like he’s paying for regular life costs as a child.
19092,there's charges for laptops and cars...
19093,This feels like miscommunication
19094,[deleted]
19095,Don't let that bother you hon.
19096,It wasn't your fault and I'm sure your grandma understands.
19097,It's honestly probably much more healing for you to have grieved how you chose instead of doing so around people who don't have your best interests at heart.
19098,I know how much it hurts to be estranged from family.
19099,I have babies who have no grandparents on my side and I hate that for them.
19100,But the alternative is so much worse its not worth going back.
19101,My heart goes out to you and know you're not alone.
19102,❤
19103,❤❤
19104,[deleted]
19105,"I saw your other thread, sweet child please listen to your wonderful wife."
19106,"You do not owe this woman for raising you, that was her choice not yours."
19107,Please maybe seek a therapist to help you through this hurt.
19108,Trust your wife to deal with this “bill.”
19109,Were you aware that they were loans?
19110,"All of the crossouts are really confusing, it's hard to understand if these are from gifts or if you borrowed a bunch of money from them"
19111,But then the interest would have started in 2012 when you turned 18.
19112,Since according to your post history states you are 28.
19113,So you would have turned 18 2012.
19114,The interest here starts in 2014.
19115,What this looked like is all loans or money borrowed after you turned 18 and since it’s for square space a business related expense and vehicles and computers etc.
19116,these were loans and money you borrowed that you told them you would pay them back and never did.
19117,Some of these things seem to be from when you’re an adult tho.
19118,A rental car can’t get those unless you’re a certain age.
19119,Square space is for a business.
19120,Me thinks there’s A LOT more to this story than what’s being said because if this was money for being “raised” there would be a lot more.
19121,This sounds off to me
19122,Crazy.
19123,Which of these items on the list are from your childhood?
19124,Just to clarify - two cars and a Squarespace account before you were 18?
19125,Sorry to be skeptical.
19126,"I guess I'm skeptical because it seems so outrageous.. 

Did they support you while you were trying to build a business?"
19127,"Some of the charges are for ""square space"" - website building?"
19128,"Also, why are you posting the info, but redacting so many items?"
19129,"No gambling, no real business expenses."
19130,"I tried to explain in so many posts, but these expenses were documented as between 2004 (age 9) and 2015 (college graduation/age 20)."
19131,"Interest began in 2014, unbeknownst to me."
19132,I'm so sorry.
19133,This is so rotten of her I don't even know what else to say.
19134,People who have kids are expected to PAY for their children.
19135,"You owe her nothing, do not give her a dime."
19136,Looks like she hasn’t kept track of anything and just did some “back of the envelope” calculations.
19137,This breaks my heart.
19138,"Of course you aren’t going to pay this insane “invoice,” but how do you move forward from this communication?"
19139,Do you go no contact?
19140,Do you tell your mom that her invoice is insane and shows she never loved you?
19141,Do you let her know that most parents never even think of keeping a tally of how much they spend on their children?
19142,Do you let her know how much this has hurt you?
19143,Do you tell her the entire internet thinks she’s a monster?
19144,"As your mom for a minute, I’m sending you an internet hug."
19145,"If you ever want to reach out to us moms for a minute, we are here for you."
19146,You deserve a moms who love you.
19147,"I am so sorry, sib."
19148,"I have seen how money can ruin relationships, and I'm sorry your mom seems to value money more than her relationship with you."
19149,(She may not be self-aware enough to realize that's the case.)
19150,I'm not hearing much about your dad on this one.
19151,Have you heard anything from him?
19152,Does he even know she sent you this?
19153,I'm glad you're taking the time to get feedback instead of immediately reaching for your wallet.
19154,I hope you will take your wife's advice and share this with your therapist.
19155,"And remember, it's okay not to be okay."
19156,"Take the time you need to process this, even if it takes a while."
19157,"Well, the good thing is it sounds like you e set yourself up nicely for the future."
19158,You have a good nest egg and what sounds like a loving home between you and your wife.
19159,I hope in a decade you can look back at this point as nothing more than a necessary hurdle.
19160,"The only power your parents (and more pointedly, your mother) is the power you allow them to have."
19161,Things that happen to us as kids reverberate throughout our lives.
19162,"Know that your internal, knee-jerk response is just your brain scrambling to quell the years of trauma from childhood."
19163,"You sound loved, truly, by those you love."
19164,"If and when things feel dark or too surreal, just remember that."
19165,"Yeah, this is definitely a tough one."
19166,"Processing this will take time - and I'm glad you've got a therapist, and it sounds like you're willing to talk about this."
19167,"&#x200B;

and for the record - that little voice is the one that your mother installed, for things like this."
19168,"The ""guilt"" voice."
19169,"again, your therapist should be able to help you ""shut it up""

She raised you because that is what parents are supposed to do."
19170,"I wish you the very best, and remember - while she birthed you, family is the people that support and loves you, not abuse you."
19171,"Yeah she raised you, but she was *supposed* to."
19172,That’s literally the bare minimum a parent needs to do for their child.
19173,The cost of parenting isn’t something that should be tallied up and then given as an adult.
19174,You didn’t ask to be born and they knew what having children would entail.
19175,She’s just being greedy and heartless because a normal parent would never do that.
19176,Also talk to a financial planner.
19177,Don’t do anything without planning the rest of your life out carefully.
19178,"wait, so was the interest known to you after turning 18 and before starting college?"
19179,i'm just trying to have a better picture painted of this situation as it's not very straightforward from where i'm standing.
19180,"especially when you bring up the room and board bits in this comment, but not the bits about the cars?"
19181,Why is she asking you to give her money?
19182,Thanks for pointing that out.
19183,But since I would have to change only one sentence anyway I'll just leave it that way.
19184,OP changed his story and is now saying cost up through age 20.
19185,"But some of these charges were clearly incurred in 2016, when he would have been around 25."
19186,"He may say that, but the last picture is a summary of expenses - clearly labeled with the years 2015 to 2021 consecutive."
19187,So make from that what you want.
19188,"Edit: yeah, I see, the years are under the category ""loan interest""."
19189,"But anyway, it doesn't change my mind."
19190,How would she even remember or have estimates of these costs?
19191,Like the Boy Scout trips??
19192,Thinking about how much time and effort she put into this makes my stomach turn.
19193,I'm so sorry.
19194,She is beyond wrong.
19195,I would need a lot of space from this person if I were in your shoes.
19196,"It doesn't seem like you took on her toxic traits, though - good for you for being better than you were raised ❤️"
19197,Damn dude.
19198,"I’m sorry, yeah that sucks…"
19199,They have all that and still have the audacity to claw for more?
19200,Don’t give em a fucking dime mate
19201,"No, between 9 and 18, then again in college she covered some (18.5 to 20)."
19202,"The interest was between 18 to 18.5, and again 20 to present."
19203,Grocery?
19204,It's their legal duty to provide you food and shelter until you come of age
19205,If they're claiming they spent 100 bucks a week to only feed *you* then they're either the world's worst shoppers or they're totally taking you for a ride.
19206,"BTW, tell them to take you to court and don't give them one single red cent."
19207,Please... give them nothing.
19208,"Use that money to set yourself free, improve your education, invest in property, travel the world (on a budget!"
19209,don't splurge!
19210,"), buy a nice, reliable, small car, pay off any credit card debt, etc."
19211,"And save, save, save the rest of it in good quality savings programs."
19212,Guess I just appreciate her sacrifice enough to sacrifice some for her.
19213,It’s unique for each of us.
19214,Next I help is my uncles.
19215,He was my father figure and has sacrificed so much for me over my life.
19216,!delete
19217,You are my hero for finding the words to name the situation so accurately.
19218,It is absolutely tragic to receive such a letter.
19219,But the silver lining you describe is also spot on.
19220,"OP, sending blessings; motherhood (or parenthood generally for that matter) is not defined biologically."
19221,"To truly be any kind of parent requires love, and love does not expect to be ""paid back"" for care; care is the very nature of love."
19222,With interest even.
19223,I have seen this type of behaviour before.
19224,"From someone that didn't think they ahd this much room to play with, financially speaking, so it was more in the order of the equivalent of $800-900."
19225,"Same type of list, on a blank printer paper."
19226,Handwritten in one go.
19227,Not a document they'd made over time to account for expenses.
19228,"Just ""hah!"
19229,I now want money!
19230,I don't know what gifts of free will means!
19231,"Even though I called them gifts, said yes when asked if I really wanted to contribute or pay for something, I am the victim ond should have money in return now!"""
19232,"In that person's list, their own gifts for their own grandchild was even written down..."
19233,"It's actually legally not okay to ask for compensation for a gift, not to mention."
19234,"Wait, I assumed those “loan interest” charges were literally loan interest payments they made for their kid’s student loans."
19235,"Like, that they had taken out a college loan, and that was the interest they had paid on the loans."
19236,"If that’s not the case, that they are charging made-up “interest” on money they loaned their kid, then Jesus Christ."
19237,That’s ridiculous.
19238,"Even if this was not a personal relationship, that’s not how loans work."
19239,You know the interest rate you’ll be expected to pay BEFORE you take out a loan.
19240,Psh.
19241,[deleted]
19242,Or better yet tell her it’s going to OP’s therapy fund to heal from that upbringing.
19243,Though that would probably start more drama than it’s worth.
19244,"Seriously, therapy can be expensive"
19245,Exactly!
19246,I need to use this money responsibly so I don’t have to try and coerce my children into paying my way in the future.
19247,Man this is infuriating to see.
19248,"I love the idea, but in reality, it might make them think that OP has a responsibility to care for them in their old age, which she doesn’t."
19249,"Better to just send back a “no, thanks” and then block."
19250,Yeah make the the prepayment add up to the exact same number she came up with.
19251,Put stuff on there monthly visits from son: 100/hr.
19252,From grandkids 25/hr.
19253,Send her the invoice or deliver it in person.
19254,And then rip up each letter like Dr Venkman in Ghostbusters.
19255,"Nah, there's no way you can play their evil game better then they can"
19256,…i’m truly astonished.
19257,no one in their right mind would ask to be repaid for expenses occurred in 2003.
19258,(also were they just keeping a paper trail of their CHILD this whole time?!)
19259,"dad didn’t sign the paper, but he’s equally as guilty as mom."
19260,both of their antics are truly obnoxious.
19261,i’m sorry you have to deal with this.
19262,you are not responsible to repay any of this handwritten nonsense.
19263,[deleted]
19264,[removed]
19265,Just send her an invoice from the day you were born for $1 million.
19266,Neither of you entered into the relationship with any financial exchange defined.
19267,That is truly obscene!
19268,"I nearly choked on my tea when I saw ""interest""... and how far back it goes!"
19269,"You don't owe anything, OP."
19270,I'm sorry you're being subjected to this from someone who is supposed to give a crap about you.
19271,"All I can say is, if you're able to limit contact with her and her toxicity, all the better."
19272,Please hang in there!

19274,this mom is greedy when she shouldn’t be.
19275,unfortunately kids are expensive.
19276,"if that were my bill it would be a lot more money, as I was in the baby ICU for 3 weeks after i was born, and had many medical appointments for various illnesses and things."
19277,"i also lived with my parents for 23 years, so i can’t imagine the rent on that!"
19278,"I think it used to be different but was getting flooded with sbitty posts or spam, 
I think there was alot of posts like,"" my mom took away my Xbox after I failed 8th grade, she's so abusive I just need a space to vent""

But I think there used to be alot of posts like that where it was totally normal parenting and kids would post trying to act like the victim."
19279,"And not actual insane parents who hear voices their kid is a demon and then tries to kill them and take their family away to ""protect"" them."
19280,"Insane parents used to be talked about the same way as tifu and truth off my chest did lol, with its all fake or bullshit karma shit."
19281,"This is the place, especially with the gaslighting… as if the “I love you” part justifies the bill for money OP should never have to pay back."
19282,"My daughter (21) is in college, but what I pay for tuition, food, health care, etc."
19283,"is a gift, since I am her PARENT."
19284,"Please know, OP, that this is so not okay… you just live your best life now, and be happy, and don’t think for a single moment that any of this “bill” is justified."
19285,"Yes, OP, definitely post it there."
19286,A very supportive community & they'll have suggestions as well as really good advice.
19287,"u/OandGTechy if you haven’t already, definitely post to r/raisedbynarcissists"
19288,thanks for all these sub links!!
19289,"my mom tells my sister and i she is going to will my brother more money than us because he’s asked for help less as an adult and given our parents more and she’s dead serious (i’m a therapist, my sister is a musician/yoga teacher/mom and my brother is a software engineer in silicon valley.. not like there’s a reason he’s never needed money and we have as adults..)"
19290,Reached out to the mods; No response.
19291,"I got a good chuckle out of this, lol."
19292,Thank you!
19293,Nah.
19294,Taking care of these horrible excuses for “parents” is being too merciful.
19295,"Clearly these monsters don’t view a family relationship as family, they view it as business."
19296,(Worse: non-consensual business they’re enforcing business on a child who ever signed up for this.)
19297,If these people view “taking care of a dependent family member person” as a business transaction—then business transactions they shall indeed have.
19298,I would charge them if they ask me to take care of them in their elderly years.
19299,"You charged me rent, food, utilities, care, etc, for when I was a child and unable to work, you expect to get paid for taking care of me when I was able to work."
19300,Fair is fair.
19301,"I expect to get paid for taking care of you, when you are unable to work."
19302,"Except you requesting to charge them money to take care of family is 100x nicer and more legal, because at least it is legal to give loans and financial contracts to adults."
19303,You cannot do that to a child.
19304,Especially without consent.
19305,"It’s like kidnapping someone, holding them hostage for 18 years, and then expecting them to pay all the expenses acquired during that time frame they were there against their will."
19306,"Like, ummmm, I didn’t ask to be here."
19307,I’m sorry but that’s hilarious
19308,[deleted]
19309,See I’m having a real hard time with this in life now.
19310,My mother beat my ass so much that it’s hard for me to support her financially although I’m well off.
19311,Yes she supported me but she also beat the brakes off me
19312,"After this stunt, they deserve nothing."
19313,"And if you give them even a cent, they will never stop hounding you for more."
19314,"Just say that after paying some debts and setting up a retirement account you don't have anything left to give, and just shrug it off."
19315,"Not that you should give anything to them, but just FYI you can give gifts of up to 12.06 million to a person tax free, you just have to report anything over fifteen thousand within a year"
19316,This is my concern at this point.
19317,"I am worried that if I pay a dollar of this, it will:

A."
19318,"Accept the bill as valid, legally
B."
19319,Give her reason to invoice more
19320,Exactly.
19321,This would make me feel extremely unloved.
19322,You dont owe them anything.
19323,!!!!!!!!!
19324,!
19325,[deleted]
19326,[deleted]
19327,A cause she disagrees with perhaps?
19328,"With her being a diehard Trumpian, I am sure I can pick a number of wonderful causes that would make her blood boil."
19329,"Not even, send her an invoice just for the invoice she sent."
19330,Bada boom you made a profit.
19331,This is the way.
19332,2014 is when the interest began.
19333,I just finished college.
19334,I personally I think paying it all in Monopoly money would be the way to go because none of what she sent is legally binding or would hold up in court.
19335,I don’t even think it would go to trial
19336,I like this response.
19337,"Gives mom a chance to do the right thing, but also sets a strong boundary."
19338,"They would scream at rage, gaslight and abuse."
19339,The first option is so true though.
19340,"If their relationship is transactional as the mother implies, then the child is no longer obligated to care for the parents in their dotage as the debt was paid in full."
19341,"Normally children care for their aging parents from a place of love, but this mother just destroyed that."
19342,"Since there’s no longer an emotional connection, and the child “paid in full”, then I guess they’re done here."
19343,Mom just FAFO.
19344,Yeah I think if it’s expenses OP used their credit card for as an adult I understand a bit more.
19345,"I think this would have worked as a face to face conversation better, perhaps with a print out of the credit card statements."
19346,Along the lines of: when you were struggling we were happy to help you out; but the truth is that these expenses have actually caused us financial hardship.
19347,"We’d never expect a handout from you; but now that you have come into some money, we’d really appreciate a discussion about if you could see your way to paying back some of the things that we bought for you.”

I wonder if they thought they were doing the “right thing” by not asking for a handout, but writing it out like this and adding things like “Loan interest” is what makes this shitty from them."
19348,"The bills started out in the early 2000s, when OP was NINE."
19349,"He is using reddit to make himself feel better, because reddit can be a safe place for people going through something."
19350,That's why he posted on THIS sub.
19351,"He isn't being deceptive, he's just hurting and his parents have mistreated him his whole life so it makes perfect sense to me that he's reaching out, feeling confused and wanting strangers to be kind to him the way his mother never was."
19352,This sub is for people who need moms in their lives.
19353,If you can't be nice to someone who is hurting then you're on the wrong sub.
19354,I’m confused.
19355,He said it goes back until about the age of nine.
19356,The censored spots are probably personally identifying items that OP didn't want to share with thousands of internet strangers.
19357,But there is no way that a minor was agreeing that their basic needs during their upbringing were loans.
19358,Parents have a duty to provide basic accommodations and care for their children while they are still minors.
19359,"Minors are not required to ""pay back"" the costs of living to their parents once they grow up and become adults."
19360,"The simple story is that OP came into a bunch of money and mommy dearest wants a piece of that pie, so mommy came up with the idea that OP owes for the costs associated with being raised by their parents."
19361,None of these were cash.
19362,"It was never a “oh, spot me $100, I will pay you back”-type situation."
19363,"Aside from, what I thought was a gift, of her handing me $20 for gas money so that I could go on a date with my high school girlfriend, I never received cash from my parents directly."
19364,It lists out items from age 9 until I finished college.
19365,"Even then, I had a job at 16 and throughout my college career, so I was covering many of my “lifestyle” costs."
19366,"Every time I asked for gas money, every time she got me a gift, even the repairs when I got into a car wreck at 16 (deer jumped onto the hood of my car from a cliff)."
19367,There was a SINGLE item on here that I was roughly agreed to that I was going to pay them back.
19368,"Dorm rooms, college apartment, a (cheap) car, gas money, movie money, Christmas gifts, rough estimates for room and board, Boy Scout trips (also redacted as it listed my troop number), everything."
19369,Op said he crossed out the names of places he staid and local businesses where his mom bought food/necessities and listed the business by name
19370,"“ these were loans and money you borrowed that you told them you would pay them back”

How can you possible know this?"
19371,It feels like people are operating off a bunch of information that I just don't see in these sheets.
19372,It's like there's a totally different set of pictures that I'm not seeing.
19373,-One sheet has a blacked out expense for 25k but it is dated 2015.
19374,Between the sheets there's like 40k on here that is explicitly dated between late 2014 and 2016.
19375,"-There's not enough there to figure everything out from the interest, but there's some information there (I'm ignoring 2014 since OP says the interest wasn't running for part of that year and I don't know exactly what that means)."
19376,"from 2015 to 2019 it grows each year by an about the amount that was the total in 2015, which is not very much compared to the size of the loan."
19377,This indicates that the amount is not growing primarily due to compounding interest but due to growth in the principle.
19378,If the principle is generated before 2014 and the interest rate is low then the total interest wouldn't change that much year to year.
19379,If the interest rate is high enough to grow the total loan that much year to year then the amount from 2015 would have been much larger.
19380,-There is another one of these itemized sheets under the first sheet has the same ledger layout with date - item - amount.
19381,So there's definitely more of that.
19382,"Given the labelling and very specific amounts it seems likely that the items at the bottom of the summary page under ""expenses"" are totals from these sheets."
19383,The items on them are mostly credit card charges for bills and some periodic ~$1500 charge.
19384,Yea I'm not sure if anyone is actually reading the line items here.
19385,"There is so much bullshit outrage about charging this ""kid"" for their upbringing lmao."
19386,"Somehow they are glossing over the square space charges, car rentals, and HUGE $10k and $20k line items and how 50% of the line items are blacked out."
19387,There is no way the parents didn't let person know it was understood this would have to be payed back.
19388,OP... did you have a successful startup and sell it?
19389,"is that how you ""came into money?"""
19390,"If your Mom had given you zero inclination that all this money she was handing you did not have to be paid back, yes... that is a bit shitty.... but a far cry from what people are running with here that she is charging you for raising you or whatever."
19391,"Yeah also, looks like interest that was charged as recent as last year."
19392,"Which makes me think they’re still paying the loans for him, but charging him for the interest."
19393,Which is a pretty good deal.
19394,I guess I’m assuming they’re student loans?
19395,Or are they saying they loaned him money and that’s the interest they’re charging?
19396,Yes.
19397,16 I was a graphic designer and was playing around with web design.
19398,One car at 16; I paid half.
19399,"Car died (head gasket), they “gifted” me a new one ~$1,700 apparently."
19400,Yeah...
19401,There's definitely more to this story than childhood expenses.
19402,"I mean that was in 2015, charging someone for a square space domain from 7 years ago is insane especially since it was only $50."
19403,Nothing here even remotely justifies what she did.
19404,"Even if she helped him with his business at 21 years old, that’s what parents do."
19405,"He seems to have been in college at the time, so he probably didn’t have a ton of disposable income and his parents charged him rent during that period too."
19406,"Worst case scenario: he wrecked a $2k car as a teenager and his parents bought him another one, asked his parents to buy him computers throughout his childhood and college years, started a business, which failed, stayed rent free while in college, was unemployed after college for a while, his parents paid for the wedding, maybe a down payment on a house too."
19407,Most parents who pay for all that don’t ask for it back in an invoice.
19408,"If they ask for some money, it’ll be as a “hey son could you help us out with our mortgage, your dad is retired now.”

This is psychotic."
19409,"The only year Netflix cost $10 a month was 2015, and she included the 59 cents of TAX in the bill."
19410,What the actual fuck is that?
19411,Unbeknownst because it's not legal to do.
19412,Because she raise me.
19413,"Sooo you’re going to surprise your kids with an itemized bill for their middle school through college expenses, with interest, about 7 years after college?"
19414,Because that’s what this is.
19415,“Yes I see that I was wrong but that doesn’t change my mind.”
19416,I paid my mum back 2000 on my first computer when I got a job at 17.
19417,"She was poor helped me out, it was only reasonable."
19418,"Let alone 2 cars, repairs etc."
19419,"As others say... We don't know the full context, but at the moment all I see is some relatively significant expenditures."
19420,We also don't know what sort of debt your parents are in.
19421,Did they borrow money to pay things for you?
19422,"You doing something nice for your mom out the kindness of your heart is one thing, her feeling entitled to said act of kindness because she raised you is a whole different one."
19423,"You seem to have given your mom money because you are grateful to her for the wonderful childhood she gave you and the sacrifices she made for that to happen, not because she presented you with an itemized bill with every expense she had with you since you were born expecting you to pay up."
19424,I could not agree with you more regarding the tragic nature of this letter.
19425,It’s truly heartbreaking.
19426,You bring up a salient point about parenting relationships being based on love without expectations.
19427,"Hugs to you, friend❤️"
19428,That part really got to me.
19429,"When my husband and I bought our first house, my parents gave us some money."
19430,"My MIL found out and then decided to ""give"" my husband remission for the interest on money they had made him lend from them years before."
19431,They never even discussed interest and he'd already paid back the money for a long time at that point.
19432,We were stunned.
19433,That’s the part that got me!
19434,Please don’t give them any money.
19435,But she presented to you is the cost of having a child.
19436,The fact that she would try to charge you loan interest absolutely blows my mind.
19437,Please save that money for yourself and your own family.
19438,"If they're Christian, point out how the Bible specifically says it's against God's rules to charge interest to family."
19439,Loony to expect interest without discussing it.. uhhh goodybye
19440,"I could be wrong, but I think they’re charging gift interest instead of loan interest 😳"
19441,Absolutely right.
19442,But some people feel that obligation regardless so I wanted to add it in but nothing in  my comment Indicates that they have an obligation at all
19443,OP should bill her for the therapy.
19444,No they weren't.
19445,"As evidenced by the handwritten list, where everything is clearly written in one go."
19446,But you can always think back and start listing things if you feel like it.
19447,"Like you say, who would want to do this?"
19448,"If they are in financially dire straits, wouldn't it be better to have a humble and honest talk, asking for help?"
19449,Normal people might do that.
19450,Maybe.
19451,Seeing if they could set up a private loan with a payment plan etc.
19452,This thing?
19453,"This thing is clearly ""I see money that I want to waste just like I've wasted my own already."""
19454,9
19455,Uh no you don’t get to give someone money and then demand it back years later just because they came into money and now you need it.
19456,"If you wanted it paid back, say something at the time."
19457,This is ridiculous
19458,Seriously!
19459,I’m surprised his mom isn’t charging for additional “pain and suffering” for when she was pregnant 😂
19460,"I bet she doesnt love anymore if OP answers ""I am not going to pay anything, love you too though"" :D"
19461,Exactly.
19462,We chose to be parents.
19463,I always tell my daughter that kids are an expensive ‘hobby’ (and she totally knows I am joking)
19464,What part of this is gaslighting?
19465,Wow your mom is a narcissistic jerk:/
19466,I’m not suggesting to actually take care of them.
19467,"I’m suggesting lying about it to drive a point, right to their face."
19468,"“Continue to be good to me or I will abandon you”…and then abandon them, if they want to."
19469,"You know, whatever’s good for OPs mental health."
19470,Millionaires love this one trick!
19471,You owe her nothing
19472,She supported you but in beating you she failed to raise you in a way that makes you want to spend money on her.
19473,"Supporting your kid is a bare minimum thing, it’s not worthy of praise it’s a part of the job of being a parent."
19474,You don’t owe her a thing.
19475,That's part of it.
19476,"She didn't provide adequately for you, you don't have to do anything for her."
19477,Just giving you food and shelter is not the full parenting job.
19478,It would open the floodgates
19479,"Debating on where your at but from what I understand (usa specific, I am not a lawyer in any way)  if you do send $$ now it has a high chance of being seen as you 'accepting' the debt and being stuck paying the entirety of this laughable extortion."
19480,If you really wanted to give them cash at this point  please do so through a lawyer.
19481,With letter stating specifically it is not for whatever this ridiculous bill is and that you do not see it as valid.
19482,(Or whatever your lawyer will suggest concerning it.)
19483,Personally seems like an awful lot of headache to give now.
19484,"Get a lawyer either way, save this in a binder cause I kinda doubt it's the last you'll receive or hear of it."
19485,"Sadly Family often gets very entitled when one comes into money, especially when they feel their owed it for whatever reason."
19486,My mother gave me a bill for 1 million dollars (CAD) back in 1986 when I turned 14.
19487,"When I told her I wasn't the one who made the choice for me to be born, she exclaimed that neither was she, and therefore I owed her."
19488,"I didn't come into money, I was just a kid trying to go to school and pick up part time jobs to pay for my needs."
19489,"I actually tried making payments to her for a while, and you know what?"
19490,Her behaviour got WORSE.
19491,"She no longer saw our relationship as transactional as she did before, she then literally saw me as her personal slave with no right to any of my own money."
19492,"Whatever I could earn, that's what I had to pay her."
19493,Every.
19494,Single.
19495,Dime.
19496,The leeching didn't stop until I finally ran away 2 years later.
19497,Don't pay her anything.
19498,You teach people how to treat you.
19499,"If you pay her, she'll treat that as her bahaviour being acceptable and she'll just keep coming back for more, tacking on more interest, etc."
19500,and it'll never end.
19501,I'm sorry you're going through this.
19502,"You're young; make plans to fill your life up with love and respectful healthy relationships, and don't waste your time with people who won't treat you with basic common decency."
19503,Best of luck.
19504,:)
19505,Make sure they know it's a gift and completely unassociated with the invoice.
19506,"If it were me, I'd let them know I got the invoice and that I'm ignoring it."
19507,Anything I would gift them would be just that: a gift.
19508,46 here and old enough to be your mom.
19509,"I would have never sent you this invoice, only a congratulations."
19510,What exactly is she charging you for?
19511,Your expenses from childhood?
19512,You owe her NOTHING.
19513,"Do not give her a dime; because if you do, then you will legally assume that debt."
19514,"Your parents chose to have a child, the expenses from raising that child are on them!"
19515,You literally cannot pay her for this reason.
19516,It will legitimize the claim.
19517,"Family members can do weird, crazy shit over money."
19518,If you don’t shut this down there will be more tactics from different relatives and more letters from your mom.
19519,Or just don't give it to her because she showed some true colors.
19520,I can't imagine my mom going so far out of her way to show me in no uncertain terms that she perceives me as a piggy bank that she's *entitled to* because she *raised you*.
19521,"Children aren't an investment, and only a shitty parent/person would look at a human being they created and be so demanding and selfish."
19522,"She chose to have you, you didn't choose to be born."
19523,"The costs of her raising you or ""loans"" or whatever is absolute bullshit, no one who bends reality the way she is in this situation is good to give money to."
19524,"It's YOUR money, and I wouldn't trust the intentions of anyone who went into the amount of effort to defraud you."
19525,"I mean Jesus Christ it was all done in the same pencil, do you *actually* think she's even keeping accurate numbers?"
19526,She's not.
19527,It's a shakedown.
19528,Question!
19529,Does your dad know she did this?
19530,"Don’t do that, it was their decision to have you as their child, and therefore it was their responsibility to raise you."
19531,"No other parent does this if it’s all about money, can’t they really be your parents?"
19532,She will just keep extorting money from you.
19533,DO NOT give them anything.
19534,"> parents that *paid* for college,

FTFY."
19535,"Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant."
19536,*The deck is yet to be payed.
19537,"*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them."
19538,*The rope is payed out!
19539,You can pull now.
19540,"*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment."
19541,"*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
19542,That's different.
19543,"But you still don't owe it to them, you just have a good relationship where you help each other financially if you need it."
19544,And that's great!
19545,But not everyone has that.
19546,Donate to something that benefits Ukraine.
19547,Or to fight the anti-trans bullshit in Texas.
19548,Seriously though - I'm sorry you're going through this.
19549,5k to BLM or Planned Parenthood!
19550,She'll be so proud of you!
19551,I just want to give you a big ole mom hug - the warm kind where I squeeze you extra tight at the end and wobble back and forth a bit because I love hugging you so much.
19552,You had mentioned abuse and now you mention them being tRump fans and now I have this gross taste in my mouth and my sorrow deepens for you.
19553,I hope you find a rad place to donate - perhaps a women's shelter or an agency for abused kids.
19554,Dang - tbh we'll more than likely need a whole new arm of the therapy industry for 'kids of abusive tRumpers' - maybe you could help make that a reality or at least help a few local kids who have experienced similar things to what you went through.
19555,"Whatever you choose, sit with it awhile and make sure it's what you *want* to do - not what guilt is making you feel like you *should* do."
19556,"And here's another big warm rocking mom hug too, congrats on the money sweetie - I hope you find ways that it can bring your life pleasure."
19557,Fuck it up!
19558,🥳
19559,That's so cold.
19560,My folks loaned me money once and I said I'd try to repay them but my funds have all been going to living expenses and they haven't asked even once about it.
19561,That's the kind of parental support you should be experiencing.
19562,More big hugs to you sweetie.
19563,Yeah left or right this really sucks.
19564,But I’m a bit annoyed by OP claiming these are ‘childhood costs’ (it’s in the post of another title) because this seems like more of a case of horrendous communication and less of a case of ‘my mother is charging me for my diapers’
19565,OP has commented before that his parents are wealthy.
19566,"Like, millionaire wealthy."
19567,"Them raising him didn't put them into any hardships, and they certainly didn't give him any indication that the things they were doing were debts they expected him to repay."
19568,My parents helped me with some bills during nursing school but it was always under the condition that I repay them.
19569,My parents paid for my brother's rehab and helped him with his first house payments and bought him his first car.
19570,"It was always a ""gift"", they went on about their generosity."
19571,"When my debts came due, it was expected."
19572,"My brother has never been asked for a cent in return, and that's what is expect."
19573,"OP is like my brothers situation, parents promised things as gifts."
19574,If they asked him to repay that now it would be a shock.
19575,OP is now 28 if that helps.
19576,Some of these charges are clearly newer than 8 years old.
19577,And there are some really big purchases redacted.
19578,"> Boy Scout trips

> Christmas gifts

I wasn't even aware that people could be this petty."
19579,[deleted]
19580,Read the items one and two OP stated the “interest” started at 18 per his account he’s 28 so the interest would have started in 2012 not 2014 like the paper states.
19581,Op stated that these where charges for parents raising him til 18.
19582,However I took a look into his profile and he is 28.
19583,Meaning he turned 18 10 years ago which would mean it was 2012.
19584,"However, the last page says interest started 2014 when he was 20(of legal age and that’s when money was given/borrowed)."
19585,Which means these aren’t charges for the cost of raising him but after he turned 18.
19586,"Second picture date 10/10 google, 10/10 tickets, 10/10 gas, 10/10 squarespace, 10/10 squarespace (which has zero to do with raising a child but everything to do with a business) 3rd page car 1 and 2   2457 computer #2 1400 and last page car 1 and 2 charges for repairs tickets car rental( which again can’t happen before the age of 18 as OP states) a charge under fall 2014 when OP would’ve been 20 not under 18 and spring 2015 where op would’ve been 21( still not 18) and the interest on the loans each year."
19587,2014 was when the interest began So it looks like either parents took out a loan or are charging him interest on a loan they gave him.
19588,But either way he was not given a bill charging him for the cost of being raised til he was 18 as he has stated and I personally believe based on him lying and trying to paint this as a completely different situation he had his parents loan him money and never paid it back and they’re asking because they need it.
19589,ETA math
19590,It itemized loan interest too.
19591,He borrowed money and never paid it back.
19592,Which is shitty seeing he bought a brand new Tesla last year his account said.
19593,Op pay your parents back the money you owe them
19594,Well plus his account says he’s 28 so the interest he says started at 18 actually started at 20 this is money he borrowed and never paid back squarespace internet utilities 2 cars 2 computers.
19595,Nah he’s a lying liar
19596,"Wow, you must have been quite the early adopter to have a Square Space account in 2010."
19597,"What about the rent and security deposits from 2015, 2016?"
19598,"Also, if this was really from your childhood - and there were charges listed on a daily basis - there should be hundreds of itemized amounts."
19599,"I would also expect things insurance, medical care, clothes, etc."
19600,I would also expect them to include costs you incurred while in college.
19601,"Sorry, this doesn't make sense as a list of items spent to raise a child."
19602,This looks like things your parents bought and paid for when you were an adult.
19603,"Whether you agreed to pay them back for these things or not, I cannot say, but I don't believe these are for childhood expenses."
19604,To note on some of these.
19605,Parents gave me dad’s car; I paid for half as that was (or I thought) the deal.
19606,"Deer jumped on that car, hence the “repair” line item."
19607,"Got another car after that one died that I thought was gifted to me ~$1,700."
19608,I got a computer at 16.
19609,Started a website to learn about web design (SquareSpace and there is another in there that wasn’t included).
19610,Worked as a graphic artist until college.
19611,"Went to college, they only paid dorm fees and a single fraternity dues fee as I was still working at the time."
19612,"They did not pay for the wedding, ring, anything of that sort."
19613,"Netflix as a family account; Turns out, I was the one stuck with the bill and I didn’t know."
19614,A large part of the bill was food-cost estimates between the ages of 9 and 18.
19615,What are you planning on doing now?
19616,You either didn't read what I wrote or you willfully ignore what I said.
19617,"So you, too, comment without reading?"
19618,"No but I had a payment plan on $14k with my mom for help with car, rent and college tuition for 1 semester."
19619,Payed that back first.
19620,Can’t live for free.
19621,In this life you either work or have someone working for you.
19622,I own a company and refuse to hire anyone because it makes me uncomfortable having someone else slave away so I can make more money.
19623,"Could just be how I was raised, I don’t use people, but when I do and have no choice, I sure as hell pay it back."
19624,Thank you and hugs back ❤️
19625,"This happened to my dad, turns out in the end it was actually his money that his mother loan him from when he would send back his pay from fighting in Vietnam…"
19626,That is SO fucked up.
19627,Gross.
19628,I hope you all didn’t pay 😅
19629,Against God's rules to charge interest to ANYBODY.
19630,USURY
19631,You deserve better.
19632,I come from an absolutely huge extended family.
19633,My husband does too and his is actually pretty dysfunctional.
19634,I don’t know ANYONE who has ever charged their child like this.
19635,It’s super crazy and don’t pay a dime.
19636,It makes me want to hug little 9 year old you because I’m pretty sure that this must be the tip of the iceberg in her crazy.
19637,"Also, I like your wife."
19638,:)
19639,I am so sorry…
19640,Oh hun.
19641,Giving you big internet hugs.
19642,You deserve better.
19643,"Your parents should be happy for you, not looking to see how they can gain from your windfall."
19644,I am so sorry.
19645,Is there a way you can see a therapist about this?
19646,"It is a lot for you to have to deal with on your own, and it might feel good to have someone slightly removed from the situation to talk about and work through feelings/develop strategies for handling all this with."
19647,Jesus.
19648,So they have the audacity to charge you money for being alive when they were the ones thst decided to have you in the first place.
19649,Absolutely ridiculous.
19650,Why 9.
19651,Why did the internet start at age 9?!
19652,?
19653,And I was 3.
19654,I’m actually very terrified my mom might do this invoice thing😅 I returned the key to the house recently..she’s broken me into a million pieces already…let’s see if we can get to one billion.
19655,uhhhhhhh so it’s literally your parents responsibility to bank roll your life until you’re 18.
19656,"Oh honey, I’d give you a hug if I could."
19657,"Ok, what the fuck."
19658,I’m so sorry.
19659,Don’t pay them anything.
19660,You need a mom?
19661,I’m here for you.
19662,We all are.
19663,I want to buy nine you old you a switch instead of charging you for stuff.
19664,Or a childbirth fee!
19665,Right.
19666,Like tacking on a 10k charge for her to go get a Mommy Makeover plastic surgery to make herself look like before she had him.
19667,🙄 I'm a mother of boys and this makes me sick.
19668,I can't imagine taking money from my sons.
19669,I can't imagine thinking about this let alone asking.
19670,If one of my babies one day comes into money and they try and give me some id have a hard time accepting tbh.
19671,"I want them to always feel secure and have a wonderful life, not worry about me."
19672,Use that money for themselves or on my hopefully one day grandbabies.
19673,This is just so disgusting all around.
19674,Bet she still does keep in contact given that OP must now be quite wealthy.
19675,She'll hope to remain in good graces so she can get some of that sweet lucre.
19676,"That whole damn thing, where she makes it seem completely normal for someone to owe their parents more than $100,000 for costs incurred while raising a child who had no input on the decision to even exist."
19677,This is Reddit.
19678,Every negative social situation is gaslighting.
19679,Waiter gets your order wrong at a restaurant?
19680,Gaslighting.
19681,"Calling out a Redditor for using ""gaslighting"" wrong?"
19682,Oh you better believe that's gaslighting.
19683,EDIT: Clearly some of you are feeling rather gaslighted by this comment.
19684,"“I recognize the parents have sent an invoice, but given that it’s a stupid-ass invoice I’ve elected to ignore it.”

~~Don’t actually say that without your lawyer’s approval~~"
19685,Awfully niche bot.
19686,Good bot!
19687,Good bot ❤️
19688,The charges go back to when op was 9????
19689,I’m pretty sure 9 year olds aren’t adults????
19690,Like if you want to play detective on a post you could read the comments from op.
19691,[removed]
19692,"I don’t see the inherent problem, though."
19693,Lots of parents give their child financial help through university and afterwards.
19694,"And regardless of age, if it was intended as a gift, asking for money back from a gift is not normal."
19695,No he redacted things like rent and stuff that would have identifying information.
19696,that changes everything.
19697,OP trying to make it sound like he’s being charged for his childhood which is not the case at all.
19698,he should’ve already paid his parents back without being asked!
19699,edit: it’s funny that this is getting downvoted.
19700,you’re not entitled to your parent’s money once you reach adulthood.
19701,even if OP didn’t agree to pay them back anything they gave him it still would’ve been decent of him to offer them something after coming into some money.
19702,i’d like to hear the parent’s side of the story.
19703,My college was free other than the dorm.
19704,The computer was given to me at 16.
19705,Food was invoiced to me between age 9 and 18.
19706,The “right thing to do” would NOT be to pay them for costs they willingly  covered with no agreement of repayment.
19707,"Yeah, OP may have had to take loans for things if his parents hadn’t paid."
19708,He would have had to apply for aid and go through education on loan terms and decide on the best rate before making a legally binding agreement.
19709,"It might have been a worse bill but it might not have, and he would’ve been able to plan his payments because he knew about the debt."
19710,His parents don’t get to play lender and set an interest rate starting from age 18 when their teenager had no idea that he was taking on a loan or the terms of that loan.
19711,"And, that’s exactly why it’s crazy?"
19712,Isn’t it?
19713,His mom gave him money that was never considered a loan and then years later she brings it up again with interest added?
19714,Why are you assuming it’s a loan?
19715,Lots of parents supper their kids through University etc and it’s not considered a loan…
19716,Yeah.
19717,Sounds like he spent their money as an adult and now that he has a good job they’re asking to be repaid.
19718,"A little weird sure the way they did it, but not totally out of the question."
19719,"Thanks for the clarification.. well, I'm still shocked at this!"
19720,"People are so strange, I've never heard of a parent doing this before so it was hard for me to believe it.."
19721,"Your mother is obviously suffering from some sort of mental illness, probably OCD."
19722,It's the only explanation that makes sense.
19723,As for you- as your mom for a minute I want to tell you how proud I am of you!!
19724,"🤩  I've read your other posts, etc.. and any parent in their RIGHT MIND would be ecstatic to have raised such an independent, ambitious, intelligent, positive man."
19725,"I don't know how you did it with your upbringing, you're amazing!"
19726,I'm so sorry that your parents are not in their RIGHT MIND.
19727,Please come back to Mom for a Minute any time you need support and love.
19728,💕 ::Hugs:: 🤗
19729,Good question.
19730,I don’t know.
19731,"Not pay her, for sure, but afterwards, I am at a loss."
19732,"I think we're just kind of shocked that you decided to expend any amount of your energy today towards defending a mother who is pretty clearly very cold and abusive, in front of her abuse victim who is clearly very hurt right now."
19733,"There are so many ""buts"" in your comment I think you should question why you felt the need to say it at all."
19734,You absolutely can ‘live for free’ when you’re nine years old which is when OP says these charges start from.
19735,Technically only fellow Israelites haha
19736,"Interest started at age 20, in 2014."
19737,"OP, I'm sorry for the pain you must feel."
19738,Hugs
19739,Gaslighting is making someone think that something that happened or was said never actually happened so they start to doubt themselves and their own perceptions.
19740,I don’t think this falls under that definition.
19741,"Man, my sister in law tried to pull this shit

We needed her to come help out for a couple of weeks, and she wanted us to pay her back for lost wages from her part time minimum wage job

I'll *give* her money, but I'm not *paying* her to be family."
19742,"What a steaming load of bullshit

She's from Japan, so it's possible it's normal there, I doubt it though"
19743,I love it.
19744,"You can see I was driving a $1,700 car."
19745,What type of lifestyle do you think I was living?
19746,I redacted some of the rent for college lines as it was listed as where I lived (name of building).
19747,"I also redacted items such as what college dorms I lived at, what Boy Scout Troop I was a part of, and some other items such as annual groceries that she purchased to raise me listed by year, but also had the business name (a semi-local chain that would be identifiable)."
19748,Don’t know what else I can say.
19749,I though this was a support sub?
19750,i’m not sure that this was agreed to be a gift.
19751,depends on the conversation that was had at the time and it doesn’t sound like we’re going to get the full story from OP.
19752,[deleted]
19753,Because this wasn’t “supporting” him thru university it was 2 cars 2 computers utilities squarespace(don’t need that for college).
19754,Also the words Interest clued me in.
19755,oh and the fact OP lied soooooo
19756,Well since interest is tacked on my guess is it was a loan and he never gave them any money and he’s buying g brand new teslas and flaunting it and now that they need the money they’re saying hey pay up and they’re probably embarrassed about needing the money
19757,this is not OCD.
19758,"I have OCD and while she may have OCD, that’s not what is causing her to do this to her child."
19759,Ask her how much her parents charged her to raise her?
19760,(Edited for grammar.)
19761,"(Hugs)

I understand how it feels to have someone you love be a crazy person, it’s happened to me.A lot but I wanted to say that if you don’t want her in your life anymore, you have the right to cut her off."
19762,I’d be curious to know how your parents were planning on making it (after your dad’s retirement) prior to you inheriting some money.
19763,"They weren’t going to bill *you* over $116K (that’s for certain)…so please don’t pay her over-the-top bat-crap insane “bill”, now."
19764,I just went through something similar to this when I told some family that I was selling my first company and taking a year off.
19765,Like... all of a sudden people had insane investment opportunities and expenses.
19766,I just went no-contact for a bit and told them my finances were personal and I couldn't get into it.
19767,Is advise to completely cut her off.
19768,This is narcissistic and outrageous.
19769,Don’t be a pushover love.
19770,"I’m 28 with a 9 year old, this is our job as parents to raise out kids!"
19771,There is no ‘give my money back’.
19772,Do NOT gift them any money either as this might be a foot in the door for them to take more from you.
19773,"Be smart my love, don’t engage and cut them off."
19774,Maybe have some therapy to help.
19775,You don’t owe them anything lovely 😊
19776,"So you didn't read it, either?"
19777,"According to the Talmud, but the bible says otherwise"
19778,It actually just means manipulate someone into questioning their own sanity.
19779,"The original story was more specific, but really it has a broader definition than that."
19780,"You can do it by denying facts, environment or feelings."
19781,"I don't know if I would say this ""document"" is gaslighting necessarily, but one *could* argue that presenting it as a normal and justified thing is bordering on gaslighting."
19782,I say this because I can easily see how someone might question their sanity when presented with this demand in this way.
19783,"That said, again I wouldn't call this gaslighting unless it was followed up by her trying to convince him this is how it is always done, or that it is normal."
19784,"Someone telling you that you owe them six figures for things which you never asked for, and providing an itemized invoice for said things in an effort to make it appear legitimate, would absolutely fall under gaslighting- especially if it made OP question whether or not they were on the hook for it."
19785,Repay this loan that you are totally responsible for.
19786,I'll be totally reasonably with payment terms and conditions.
19787,However I think you're correct in that this isn't like the movie but it is a complete fabrication that OP has any responsibility for the sum.
19788,I almost made the same typo earlier today and was confused why my phone didn’t try to correct it.
19789,Now I know!
19790,I like this bot.
19791,She changed you for Boy Scouts?!
19792,That is petty to the point of insanity.
19793,Is this new/weird behavior for your parents?
19794,"If *my* mom did something like this, I would only blink as far is it was necessary to roll my eyes."
19795,"(In fact, I looked really closely at her handwriting to make sure you weren’t one of my sisters.)"
19796,"But if my husband’s parents did something like this, I would be making immediate appointments with a neurologist, you know?"
19797,[removed]
19798,Moms also have to be pragmatic
19799,so.. i'm on the fence here.
19800,"yes, OP was an adult and his parents were not obligated to cover his expenses in college- but they did."
19801,"and if it wasn't communicated as a loan, and at the time given as a gift, and appreciated as a gift, then it's the parent's problem, not OP's."
19802,"you can't agree to something you don't know about, and shifting from 'i'm taking care of you' to 'this was a loan' only because he came into money is gross as fuck."
19803,as an adult i've lived with family when i've been struggling.
19804,"they haven't charged me rent, and they've fed me."
19805,"if, 5 years later i came into money and they DEMANDED an unagreed upon amount of rent to be paid to them, with an arbitrary amount of interest stacked on top, i'd likely not  have a relationship with them after that."
19806,"our relationship benefited from the help that they offered, so to change that when it's convenient.. fuck that."
19807,"just as i didn't demand or expect the help when i was struggling (i merely accepted when offered), they shouldn't demand or expect repayment."
19808,my mother helped greatly in my purchase of my laptop to go to college.
19809,as a gift to help me and my life.
19810,"if i graduated and she sent me a bill, i'd feel violated and betrayed."
19811,"i feel like we're missing some important details in this, but i def give the benefit of the doubt to OP."
19812,"like, who tf expects to be paying for their boy scout fees as an adult?!"
19813,with interest?
19814,!
19815,Ok but what about the largest amount on there?
19816,$50k for food between the ages of 9-18?
19817,That he's being charged a significant amount of interest for?
19818,"The boy scout troop activities, where he was clearly a minor?"
19819,"While one can argue about the college expenses...the fact that a significant amount of this ""invoice"" is for the care of a minor child is pretty messed up a not something OP should have to pay."
19820,"It doesn’t matter, though, if it was given without ever saying it was a loan."
19821,You can give someone a gift at any age.
19822,Giving someone a gift and then asking money back for it and adding interest to it is exactly why this is crazy parent material.
19823,And I’m pretty sure he had a comment that said the interest started after he left college at 20.
19824,"while on principle i mostly agree with you, the difference is how it was given at the time."
19825,and we can't know that from this post.
19826,"did the parents say 'we'll help you with it now, please pay us back when you can and you're on your feet', or was it 'we've got this for you, we want to make sure you're as set for life as possible'?"
19827,it makes a huge difference.
19828,"the squarespace makes me lean one way, and the boy scouts makes me lean the other way."
19829,That’s the thing… He has a $2MM retirement account.
19830,"They live in a 6,000sqft McMansion."
19831,This is pure greed and resentment.
19832,I did.
19833,I'm telling you I think your comment was uneccessary and tone deaf in this situation.
19834,[removed]
19835,Well it’s my opinion that he’s lying and he absolutely knew it was a loan based off of the lies and information given you don’t that’s great have a good day
19836,The squarespace 2 cars 2 computers utilities and that she started tacking on interest makes me believe it was a loan and the fact that OP tried to lie about it.
19837,That’s just my opinion tho.
19838,Thanks for your input.
19839,I think you didn't understand what I was saying.
19840,Rule 1 Warning.
19841,"If there are trolls, report, block, ignore."
19842,"Don't engage, it's never worth it."
19843,"I encourage you to consider the possibility that people can understand you but still disagree with your point, the way you expressed your point, or both."
19844,"Mostly because:

>If there was no earlier negotiation about you paying them back for anything on this list, this is ridiculous and shameful and you should NOT pay them."
19845,"OP already stated there was no earlier negotiation, no indication that they would ever be expected to pay for anything on this list (except I think OP said one car thing), that their parents were abusive growing up, and we already have the *huge red flag* of this going back to OP being nine years old."
19846,"Your whole ""Well I can see your parents side *if*"" point is clearly already moot by your own admission, so you even going down that path when talking to an abuse victim who is clearly really, really hurting right now is kind of... not the most empathetic choice."
19847,"A person in a situation like this needs support, not ""I can see your parents side under circumstances that are clearly not relevant to this situation,"" regardless of whether or not you added caveats like the one above."
19848,"In another context your comment would've been very reasonable, but I think that, in this context it is, again, just tone deaf."
19849,"Baby, I am proud of you, too!"

20973,My first birthday without my mom was so hard.
20974,I tried to think of a way to cut through the heaviness.
20975,"It had only been 6 weeks since her passing, and my friends and family knew I was struggling, so I tried to be strong."
20976,"I said to a few of them, “This us the first birthday my mom isn’t here for."
20977,"I mean, she was there when I was *born*.”   
Some of them got it and some didn’t."
20978,"But since my mom has a tricky sense of humor, I thought she’d approve."
20979,"And she’d probably say, “Well, duuuh!”  

I won’t say happy birthday because to me it looks like there are some tears gathering, despite your smile."
20980,I will say that I hope your birthday can bring you memories of better times.
20981,Happy Birthday!
20982,Wishing you happiness and love.
20983,Have a great birthday.
20984,"The happiest of birthdays to you, sweetheart."
20985,"She might not be with you physically, but she is with you mentally and emotionally."

21271,Happy birthday RP2!
21272,!
21273,Very welcome:)
21274,Cleanliness is next to godliness…..swab the deck!
21275,"Aww, don't say ""only an RP""!"
21276,I can fix someone who is physically messed up but helping people who are spiritually/psychologically messed up is a whole different challenge!
21277,Plus Chaplains are almost always a *different* lot so having to hang out with them all day is something I'm not sure I could do 😂
21278,Ah apologies I saw the Marine uniform and assumed.
21279,You know what they say I guess
21280,❤️
21281,You’re very welcome.
21282,🤗
21283,🥹❤️

21287,Thank you lol
21288,Thank you!
21289,That’s okay lol

21294,"LOVE how the design on the belt, the red shirt, and the subtle textures of the outer layer all come together."
21295,You have great taste and look fabulous!
21296,Also omg where did you get your phone case?
21297,Big sis here!
21298,You look amazing and I love the side part in your hair.
21299,Love it!!
21300,The belt is especially cute.
21301,👌🏻 you should find yourself a cute pair of earrings that kind of match the buckle for any future events!
21302,It’s very cute!
21303,What concert?
21304,Have a great time!
21305,"I like it babes, looks like you're really finding your own style and that's awesome"
21306,"Hi love, mum here."
21307,You look beautiful.
21308,I am very proud of the women you have become.
21309,Have a great time.
21310,Hey little sis!
21311,You look totally badass in that outfit!!!
21312,"I love that belt… if it goes missing, don’t come for me 😜 Your hair looks really cute like that too."
21313,You know I always wished I could get mine wavy the way yours is!
21314,Sending much love your way!
21315,💕I hope you have fun at your concert!
21316,"Please stay safe, and be sure to take lots of pictures for me!"
21317,💖
21318,You look great!
21319,Maybe as some jewelry to finish the look?
21320,You’re gorgeous sweetie!
21321,Have a good time and stay safe!
21322,❤️
21323,I hope the concert is awesome and you have the BEST time.
21324,I love the lace top and the belt and I think you look lovely.
21325,I just don’t understand people who feel like they’ve “lost a son”.
21326,You have always been you.
21327,You have always been the same person.
21328,"If anything, you were not complete."
21329,You were not someone else who is now gone.
21330,You have only become more you and I wish these kinds of parents could see that.
21331,"You have not been replaced by someone else, you have just become a better version of yourself."
21332,"A happier one, a more complete one, a you that you can feel good about."
21333,"All we do in life is trying to grow, to better ourselves, to become more of the person we want to be."
21334,"Sometimes it’s just a small thing like giving up smoking, taking up a hobby, removing toxic friends."
21335,Sometimes it’s a big thing like changing your appearance.
21336,But inside… you are always the same person.
21337,And I love every part of you.
21338,"Son or daughter, it doesn’t matter."
21339,You’re family.
21340,You’re perfect.
21341,Perfect concert outfit!
21342,I'm sorry your mom is grieving and can't give you the attention you deserve.
21343,Hang in there sweetie!
21344,You look great!
21345,Have fun!
21346,My only elephant in the room here is concerts can sometimes be a bit of a scary place- lots of people.
21347,"Buddy up, make sure your phone is charged (airplane mode is helpful to conserve battery) and stay safe!"
21348,You have a great sense of style!
21349,Mom here: You look adorable!
21350,"Also, I am guessing you only recently announced your true gender, so your mother probably just needs some time."
21351,I speak from experience when I say it is so strange wrapping your head around finding out your child is not the gender assigned at birth and likely has a new name to go with the new pronouns.
21352,Eventually your mother will figure out she hasn't lost a son while gaining a daughter and that you are the same person you have always been.
21353,"Of course, some parents have the sense to keep their struggles to themselves and not burden their child with them."
21354,But that awkward silence says she is still processing.
21355,Hopefully she will find a therapist or someone supportive of the LGBTQ+ community to talk to and be able to be the supportive parent you need again soon.
21356,She will come around and there will be fun mother-daughter shopping trips in the future.
21357,"In the meantime, you have the moms on here to send you love and support."
21358,Mom here - you look beautiful dear.
21359,Love what you've done with your hair.
21360,"Be careful, keep an eye on your drink all the time."
21361,"Get an Uber, don't let your friends drive you home if they've been drinking."
21362,Promise you'll message me when you get home.
21363,I wanna know you got home safe.
21364,"Love you, but most importantly, love yourself."
21365,"I think you look cute, love."
21366,I hope you have a blast at the concert!
21367,You look so cute!
21368,I love the outfit.
21369,I hope your Mom comes around.
21370,Sometimes it takes a bit for us to adjust.
21371,When my first kid came out it took me a little while to understand just because I really didn't know anything.
21372,"My daughter looked at me and said, ""It is still me, Mom."
21373,"I am the same person""."
21374,It was then that I realized that I didn't know my kid as well as I thought I did but when I saw her flourish and blossom and come into her own it made all the difference in the world to me.
21375,Keep doing you babe!
21376,All my years have taught me that we need to be true to who we are and not to deny that trying to make other people happy.
21377,I am very proud of you.
21378,Your mum was stunned into silence because you’ve transformed into a butterfly.
21379,That’s the only reasonable explanation here.
21380,You look fantastic!
21381,I hope you have a wonderful time at the concert.
21382,"Someday, I hope your mum wakes up and realizes how lucky she is to have a beautiful vibrant daughter, unafraid to be herself."
21383,"In the meantime, cultivate a circle of loving, supportive, safe people who you can be yourself with that cherish you."
21384,I love it!
21385,It’s perfect for the show
21386,I'm excited for you.
21387,Your outfit looks very cute and comfy.
21388,And your hair?!Gorgeous!
21389,I'd have to style mine for many hours to look that nice.
21390,Hello lovely!
21391,"Loving this look, you’ve got a Hailee Steinfeld vibe going on (I hope that’s still a compliment!)."
21392,-Mom
21393,Hey hon!

21406,I’m sure you’ve got it all worked out already.
21407,I can’t wait to hear all about you having the time of your life and then getting home safe!
21408,"Also, just checking in, are you hydrated?"
21409,Fed?
21410,Getting rest?
21411,Okay I’ll stop helicoptering now.
21412,"Sorry, it’s my prominent love language."
21413,No.
21414,It's perfect.
21415,Shows off all you're best features.
21416,Excellent selection!
21417,I remember picking just the right out fits for concerts!
21418,You've done an awesome job!
21419,Proud of you!
21420,Be safe!
21421,Concerts can get a little rough if you're on the floor.
21422,Do you have seats or general admission?
21423,"If it's a local show, make sure and buy some merch!"
21424,"Your parent is losing a son, and that’s hard, *but* it’s entirely up to them if they gain a daughter."
21425,"You look amazing, have fun, girl!"
21426,You look beautiful!
21427,Love the belt!

21486,I also hope you have a blast at the concert
21487,You look lovely girl.

21490,❤️
21491,Red lipstick would look BOMB with that!
21492,!
21493,Pretty red lipstick and nail polish would be amazing with this outfit.
21494,"You know, I have the perfect pair of earrings for that."
21495,They are clip on and really sparkly!
21496,Remember.
21497,Anytime you go to a crowded place like a concert it is best to wear stud earrings or clip-ons because dangling earrings are easily caught by accident when people are having too much fun.
21498,Just a girl tip♡
21499,Hi.
21500,This is mom.
21501,I was awkwardly silent because I'm ragingly jealous of this look.
21502,You said you got it on Amazon?

21520,Oh girl you are so adorable!!

21522,I’m so sorry some people can’t see past who you used to be so they can love who you are.

21541,I love that black lace top!!!
21542,Have fun and be safe at the concert.
21543,"My dear daughter, how could I miss my son when he never existed?"
21544,"You've always been my daughter, I just didn't realize it before!"
21545,"I'm so sorry for ever mis-gendering you, and I am so proud of you for being your true self!"
21546,"I love you, just as you are, always."

21589,"For some of us, when we give birth to our children, we believe they are the most amazing and perfect being ever."
21590,So I hope your mom is just taking some time with her own transition with your transition.

21626,If you ever need a friend I'll be here for you.
21627,I'm nowhere near as far along in my transition but every time I see someone else's progress it gives me that much more hope for what's coming.

21661,"As your other mums on here have said, a red lipstick and maybe some red earrings would finish it off perfectly (if you like lipstick that is, it can be a pain sometimes if you know you might sweat it off dancing!)"
21662,Have fun at your concert ♥️♥️
21663,Looks super cute and fun!!
21664,Also loving the hair swept to one side look!

21672,"More importantly I am so proud of anyway with the strength to go out into the world and unapologetically say ""This is who I am""."

21707,"Your top looks very nice, I'd suggest trying it with straight leg black dress pants and some red heels, hair in a thick doughnut bun with some loose hair framing your face on one side."
21708,Red lip and subtle smokey eye.
21709,"The shorts with a bright red or white off-shoulders top with some ruffles tucked into the shorts and strappy sandles, hair down but to the side and a bold earring would be stunning on you."

22060,[I got it from Amazon!
22061,](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TDGJ1Z9?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)
22062,That's what i came here to say too.
22063,The side part and the red give OP a standout look.
22064,Yes!
22065,"And OP, if you're looking for some added bounce and definition for your gorgeous curls, pop on over to r/curlygirl :-)"
22066,I didn’t think of that!
22067,Thanks for the advice!
22068,Stray Kids!
22069,"I’m not exactly a K-pop fan, but my friend is, and I’m excited to go just to see her again after a year and a half."
22070,Second the hair!
22071,That’s the plan!
22072,"This was the base concept, and I was looking for suggestions like this."
22073,"I’m planning on getting a nice necklace, a bracelet or two, and thanks to another suggestion, some nice earrings!"
22074,"What they've ""lost"" is all the expectations they've unfairly placed on someone."
22075,"Things that they've assumed THEY will get to experience (based on stereotypical ideas of gender, no less), instead of the reality that they've given a gift -- for life is supposed to be a gift -- and now it's their kid's life to do with as they will."
22076,"The joy of parenting isn't in watching your kid live up to *your* expectations, and fulfill *your* dreams."
22077,"It's in watching them to discover the world and discover themselves, and forge something just for them."
22078,It's watching them become their own superhero and getting the privilege of holding their cape.
22079,Thank you so much for the support!
22080,I’ve been out for two years now.
22081,I understand that in the scheme of things that’s not too long; I’m nearly thirty myself.
22082,"She does her best, which I appreciate, but it’s still hard when I see how she interacts with my sister."
22083,"We talk a lot, and she’s even called me by my name a few times."
22084,"I love her, but some days I just… need that same excitement she used to show me when I shared things I was proud of, like my grades or the gift I found for her birthday."
22085,"I wish - so, so much - that I could convince her and my dad to go to therapy, but they continually insist they’re making fine progress by themselves."
22086,Maybe one day she’ll be able to use my pronouns or say my name without hesitating beforehand.
22087,Maybe one day she’ll be ok calling me her daughter.
22088,Sometimes I feel like I’m old enough to just get over it.
22089,I have my own child for christ’s sakes.
22090,But you never stop missing mom and the way she treated you.
22091,Nice!
22092,Perfectly explained to give this daughter some insight!
22093,Yay!
22094,Lol..
22095,I second that!
22096,Thank you for the validation!!!
22097,"It doesn’t happen every time, but I’m starting to see myself in the mirror and I love how I look ❤️"
22098,Being trans isn't considered a mental illness; the current medical consensus disagrees with you.
22099,"You're being anti-science, as well as unnecessarily rude in a space meant for positivity and support."
22100,"Either you're brigading to harass OP just because she's trans, or you're a regular here, understand the purpose and tone of the sub, but decided to go out of your way to be unpleasant anyways."
22101,"Either way, the fact that 0.3% of the population *existing* grinds your gears so badly that you'd do either of those things is frankly pathetic, and everyone here can see that."
22102,OP isn't hurting or affecting you at all.
22103,"You need to examine yourself and figure out why you feel the need to treat other people this way, especially without having done the basic research to understand that what you're saying is patently incorrect."
22104,"If you think that you know better than the experts, though, then I honestly pity the people around you for having to deal with such an arrogant, ignorant person."
22105,It isn’t a mental illness.
22106,Oh!
22107,"And have a good, safe time!"
22108,"Dude, wtf?!!!"
22109,"This is a support page, not a tear down page"
22110,"I told someone else here this, but the current scientific consensus disagrees with you."
22111,🤷 Being trans isn't considered a mental illness-- this isn't obscure information.
22112,Maybe you should get some information literacy in your life?
22113,I have the same belt!
22114,But I got it in black and in cream.
22115,Goes great with so many things!
22116,You look amazing!
22117,I hope you have a great time at the concert!
22118,Ignore the troll.
22119,"You look great - love the outfit and have a great time at the concert, sis!"
22120,[removed]
22121,"Also, if you're a lipstick girl, something a bit more bright red would look great with that top."
22122,And you have the hair and the skin tone to pull off slightly bright lips without it looking over the top.
22123,I was gonna suggest a nice necklace!
22124,It would give some more pop to the outfit
22125,A necklace would also look very good with that outfit
22126,Oh have fun!
22127,You’re gonna love their energy and update to us how it went!
22128,That’s what a good friend does!
22129,So not only am I here to tell you that your outfit is stunning and you look amazing but also that I’m proud of the person that you’ve become.
22130,You’re a good friend.
22131,Because we all need someone who’s going to show up for us and that’s what you’re doing for your friend.
22132,"I hope you have fun and stay safe, beautiful 💜"
22133,"i'm not sure if not-moms can post here, but as a STAY/skz fan and a non-binary sibling, i hope you have a super good time with your friend!"
22134,"i love your concert fit so much 🥰 i haven't seen stray kids in concert yet but from what i've seen online, they're amazing, so enjoy!"
22135,"I'm low key envious now :D  
Sometimes I feel like I will never see the Korean groups I like."
22136,"Stray kids are great Live - Wish you a good time, have fun for me as well!"
22137,That sounds like a lot of fun.
22138,"Concerts always let me forget my stress for a moment, I hope you and your friend have a great time."
22139,Omg have fun!
22140,!
22141,Yes it would finish your look!
22142,Maybe some light make up?
22143,You don't need allot maybe a bit of eye makeup.
22144,Oh wow!
22145,I thought she was told only recently since her reaction seems so deer-caught-in-headlights.
22146,I am sorry for assuming.
22147,"To hell with being patient, she has had more than enough time already to adjust."
22148,"She and your father aren't making progress; they are years in and still stagnated in what should have been right away, or at least the first few days!"
22149,"I found Nicole Maine's book, Becoming Nicole, extremely helpful in those first few weeks."
22150,Reading about her mother and father's reactions helped me understand my  feelings better.
22151,I suggest gifting them a copy.
22152,I am sending you all the love and support right now.
22153,It is long overdue.
22154,I’m not too many years past your age and I understand what you mean about wanting your mom to be your mom instead of someone loosely resembling her.
22155,"And this next part is the “easier said than done” part but, put yourself first."
22156,If they don’t want to do therapy and they won’t make any progress it’s time to have an awkward conversation with yourself about are you ok with this being your relationship with her forever or is it more harm than good.
22157,Wherever you fall on the spectrum between the two—go from there.
22158,Can you keep it up like this?
22159,"Consider, too, do you want to have your child growing up watching her continually misgendering you and failing to have the bare minimum of respect for you?"
22160,There’s no right or wrong path to finding your own peace with her and your relationship but you owe yourself finding that place you can have peace.
22161,"And for the record, you look beautiful!"
22162,The outfit is a great choice and I hope you enjoy every moment of your concert.

22164,Gender dysphoria absolutely is a mental illness
22165,[removed]
22166,"Oh look, a low effort troll from someone with the user name ""never gonna give up rape""."
22167,I'm sure you are a well adjusted individual whose opinions should be held with any worth.
22168,How unfortunate it would be to be someone who knows you; a person with such low value of themselves they feel the need to rip at others searching for happiness.
22169,And you look like a lonely turd :)
22170,Even a darker red kind of burgundy color would look amazing on her
22171,Yes she could make this look pop with just a few accessories!
22172,FELLOW ENBY SIBLING HERE!!!!
22173,🤜🏼 i concur; i hope you have/had a wonderful time; your outfit ROCKS!!!
22174,!
22175,"Was planning on some eyeliner, mascara, and maybe getting adventurous with some new shades of eye shadow."
22176,Have you actually looked it up?
22177,"Being trans isn't a mental illness-- gender dysphoria is a mental illness that *can* occur in trans folks, but it can be alleviated and isn't an intrinsic, permanent aspect of being trans."
22178,"Again, you need to [do your research."
22179,](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/) Here's over 50 peer-reviewed studies demonstrating that allowing trans people to transition and providing them with social support has great benefits for their wellbeing and quality of life.
22180,[Conversion therapy doubles a trans person's risk of attempting suicide.
22181,"](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-conversion-therapy-associated-severe-psychological-distress-n1052416) (**EDIT:** Sorry, *more* than doubles."
22182,"And for trans kids, it increases the rate by 4x."
22183,"But sure, you're looking out for people's best interests) So trying to force people to *stop* being trans sure isn't helping anyone."
22184,"And speaking of suicide, the oft-touted attempt statistic used to slander trans people as inherently mentally ill is linked tremendously to instances of [rejection, abuse, discrimination, and violence."
22185,"](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/suicidality-transgender-adults/)

It's not killing them with kindness, because trans people kill themselves because of people like you."
22186,"If you can look at all of this and still feel determined to stick your head in the sand and deny reality, then you're beyond any help I or anyone else can offer you."
22187,It is not.
22188,????????
22189,Okay.
22190,"Let's walk through this, I wanna really dissect this thermonuclear take you just put down."
22191,"So, let me get this straight--

Being trans was once deemed a mental illness, but as time went on, we realized that therapeutic/psychiatric interventions to cure people of being trans [didn't work and consistently did more harm than good](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-conversion-therapy-associated-severe-psychological-distress-n1052416), increasing the suicide attempt rate by more than double in trans adults, and quadrupling it in trans kids."
22192,"Similarly, we realized that the high suicide attempt rate that was so often touted to justify pathologizing trans people is [a more external issue than internal, as it's linked heavily to instances of discrimination, abuse, hate, rejection, violence, etc."
22193,"](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/suicidality-transgender-adults/)  

And furthermore, studies done on how transition and social support impact trans people [could not have been more clear in overwhelmingly demonstrating that medical transition and acceptance provide a substantial increase in quality of life."
22194,"](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/) Altogether, evidence was clear that being trans is an innate quality in a person, an unchangeable aspect of who they are."
22195,"The classification was updated accordingly, and so currently only gender *dysphoria* is considered a mental illness, one that *can* occur in trans people, but that can be alleviated."
22196,The best treatment outcome--per the studies linked above--comes about when trans people are allowed to live as their authentic selves.
22197,"The dysphoria is treated, not their identity."
22198,"--And so in regards to your point: You believe that because this entire process occurred, that means that it by default actually *is* a mental illness, because..?"
22199,Because you say so?
22200,"Do you think that because they were wrong in the past and changed as they got more information, that they must obviously just be wrong again?"
22201,"Have you been doing some revolutionary studies on the side that the rest of us just aren't aware of that'll completely shake up decades of intensive research by experts in the medical, sociological, and psychological fields?"
22202,"The consensus is very clear, so I'm sure the world of medicine (And more) would be astounded to hear your game-changing findings."
22203,"Gosh, I don't know why I didn't think about things like this before."
22204,"Just because something is disproven, doesn't mean it's disproven!"
22205,"Good lord, the sky is the limit!"
22206,"Quickly, we should reexamine humorism; just because we realized germs exist doesn't mean they *actually* exist, and so just because we've determined there's no scientific basis for the theories behind humorism, that doesn't mean it isn't real!"
22207,"..My God, the wandering wombs!"
22208,We've been letting them run rampant all these years!
22209,"Bring out the supplies for scent therapy, we have to cure the womenfolk of their ills!"
22210,"And we really should get back to lobotomizing the poor fools in the asylum.. Goodness knows that may truly be the only cure, because y'know, it just sorta *feels like it."
22211,"*

✨Facts don't care about your feelings.✨ So unless you've got some actual, properly sourced facts to counter all of this, you might wanna go back to your echo chamber to be sure your pwecious feewings don't get hurt any further by reality."
22212,🥺
22213,"You're right, that would look great too!"
22214,Yaaaas to the eye shadow.
22215,Concerts are the prime place for your inner baddie to come out.
22216,Lots of great suggestions here!
22217,You look lovely as is and you'll be able to choose from a wide palette with your coloring too!
22218,To keep it classic without being over the top remember the basic guideline is bold eyes *OR* bold lips (not both).
22219,Use muted nude or smoky shades for the features where you don't go bold.
22220,Hope you have/had a great time!
22221,Red nails would also look fab :-)
22222,Has been labeled a mental illness for centuries
22223,[removed]
22224,Idk.
22225,It's a concert.
22226,Bold is good.
22227,Maybe even some subdued glitter?
22228,?
22229,And science has disproved it as one.
22230,So no.
22231,It isn’t.
22232,That might've been because it was nonsensical and incoherent.
22233,"Charitably, it's an inane, enlightened centrist catch-22."
22234,">""if you think it isn't a mental illness cuz it was only one in the past before we learned more about the subject, then you can't say that what we learned actually disproves the original classification!"
22235,"It changed before, so it could change again!"""
22236,-is a complete non-argument.
22237,It ignores the entire concept of scientific progress and the mechanisms with which we're able to more accurately understand ourselves and the world around us over time.
22238,"The increasing understanding we have regarding trans people isn't something that came about in a bubble; our understandings of psychology, sociology, medicine, etc, have all improved over time, and with that we've been able to make strides in further examining and understanding an innumerable amount of subjects, and trans people are just one of them."
22239,"Our capacity for research is ever-compounding, and so I feel like my response was pretty reasonable."
22240,"If you find reason to doubt the current scientific consensus as a layman because it used to be different and could theoretically change back (Despite not having any evidence to justify shrugging off the veracity of the countless studies that have been done in recent years), then that same logic can be applied to quite literally everything we understand about our reality."
22241,"We disproved the idea that lobotomies are the best treatment for psychiatric disorders, have decades of research demonstrating that other treatment methods have better outcomes, but by your logic, that isn't proof: our understanding changed in the past, so it could change again, and thus we might as well not take a side either way."
22242,"Given all you had to say was ""no lol, you got it wrong!"""
22243,"without any actual explanation as to what I apparently misunderstood, and the fact that you neither provided any counters to the sources I linked backing up my point, nor any reliably sourced facts to back up *your* argument (That I'd asked you directly for), I'm kinda getting the impression that I both wasn't really that far off, and that you never actually *had* any material cause to doubt the idea that being trans isn't a mental illness."
22244,"And if that's the case, it's pretty silly of you to have tried acting like there's an argument to be made without having done any research on the subject."
22245,"😊

I try to correct misinformation when I come across it, but I'm not interested in playing tit-for-tat with people who can't even bother pretending they're arguing in good faith."
22246,"Unless you have some relevant, accredited sources to back up your notion that scientific progress regarding trans people means nothing, don't expect any further responses from me."
22247,No science has not disapproved it and science also does not recommend transitioning or puberty blockers…..
22248,"You are so talented, have you ever thought of offering that professionally?"
22249,You have one lucky god daughter.
22250,Holy SHIT.
22251,This is amazing!!!
22252,I would’ve killed to have a slumber party here - well done.

22884,"I am so glad you allowed yourself to trust them with this, and I am so, SO happy for you - all of you!"
22885,"Congratulations, Emmellyn!"
22886,This nearly made *me* cry.
22887,"I wish I had this kind of support, as I lost both my parents too and do not have much family left (33F)- but I am so so happy for you dear."
22888,It doesn't matter how old we are- we always yearn for parental figures.
22889,"And to have that, in a way that's safe and secure, is such a beautiful thing."

22950,This has made my day.
22951,"I wish you a lifetime of peace, happiness and love."
22952,This is awesome.
22953,I understand the desire to change your middle name.
22954,My middle name was also my mother’s first name (and my grandmother’s middle name).
22955,When I got married.
22956,"My maiden last name became my middle name (because it is my father’s last name and he eventually got his act together and realized all the shit my mom put my brother and I through-they got divorced), and I took my husband’s last name."
22957,It was a wonderful feeling not to be tied to her that way anymore.
22958,I can’t explain it.
22959,"She’s still around, but we are almost no contact, and I don’t think she even knows I did that."
22960,I think your lovely news and touching story about your true name has created a lot of smiles.
22961,I know my own face is stretching into a wide grin for you!
22962,I just want to echo everyone else here and say that we’re *not* tired of your updates and you’re *always* welcome to share them with us!
22963,"I’ll even admit that I was a bit sad today at the idea that we might not hear any more of the story of this amazing family that’s come together in exactly the way they needed to to become something most of us only dream of, so I’m so glad you told us the news!"
22964,"The difference in your posts/comments from two days ago is amazing, too."
22965,"I hope you never forget how good this feels, and always move in the direction that brings you more of this energy in your life."
22966,It’s the best compass I know of.
22967,🥰
22968,Never going to get tired of your updates!
22969,It’s such a happy outcome.

23215,Thank you 😊
23216,🙏🏼 thank you
23217,Thank you!
23218,And I agree I love the meaning but also that they tied it back to their own middle/first names.
23219,With choosing to start with a E name but also including the ELL spelling
23220,Thank you!
23221,Thank you!
23222,!

23237,Thank you!
23238,I don’t think I ever could pick a name that means more

23258,Thank you!
23259,Thank you!
23260,!
23261,"I love it too, it means so much how hard they thought to tie it in with meaning and spelling - they exceeded every bit of expectation I had of what they would choose"
23262,Thank you!
23263,Thank you!
23264,I love it too - it far exceeded my expectations
23265,Thank you!
23266,Thank you and I don’t mind at all!
23267,!
23268,They’re giving me everything they possibly can by adopting me the least I can do is give them a chance as parents and a couple to name a child together especially since they’ve never had a biological child together
23269,Thank you!!!
23270,💕💕
23271,"I’m not a parent so I wasn’t really sure how big of a deal it might be but it seemed like that’s kind of a big thing for parents and they never got to experience that with one another

So I figured since they’re giving me everything they possibly can by adopted me I could give them that moment together to choose a name 

Hopefully it meant something"

23294,Thanks 🙏🏼
23295,Thanks 😊
23296,Thanks 🙏🏼
23297,Yea for me it was really about cutting that tie of a reminder of who created me.
23298,"So by changing my middle and last name I lose my bio fathers last name and lose my bio mothers first name.........now I get my Dad’s last name and my middle name is a name him and Mom chose specifically for me, and they got to experience naming a child together."
23299,Knowing my current name is now just temporary makes me feel a weight has been lifted
23300,"Thank you, it’s been a lot to take in the last couple days."
23301,I’m pretty emotionally burnt out and physically exhausted
23302,"Believe me I’m slipping back a little bit, but it’s because I’m overwhelmed by all my emotions now that things are slowing down for then night."
23303,"I’m staying with Mom and Dad again for a couple days with my dog too, but I’m struggling to not just cry for 10 straight hours."
23304,"I’m sooooo happy, but the amount of emotions is pushing me to an overwhelmed breaking point and I don’t know how to verbalize that or ask for help"
23305,Thank you!
23306,!

23329,Thank you!
23330,!
23331,Thank you!
23332,Knowing that my current one is now just temporary until the adoption is final already feels like a lifted weight of moving on from my past

23340,Thank you!
23341,They’re super supportive and excited.
23342,"It took them like a hour after finding out that I agreed to make a group chat with me in it labeled “[family name] siblings” 

They’ve also known since the beginning of April that my parents were gonna ask, my parents sat them all down individually to make sure they were ok with it before asking."
23343,Me.
23344,I hope and pray you find your people too!!!
23345,🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
23346,Thank you 😊
23347,Lol it was very surreal writing it on the documents at the lawyers today in the section about name changes.
23348,Thank you!!
23349,!
23350,I don’t know why but that sentence made me start to cry again.
23351,Awe well thanks!!!
23352,!😊😊
23353,Thank you!
23354,!
23355,Thank you!
23356,"Thank you, and you’re right I can never repay them for anything they’ve done for me"
23357,Thank you!
23358,"Thanks 😊 
That made me tear up"
23359,Thanks 😊

23375,Thank you!
23376,If it helps I’m crying still too
23377,Thank you!
23378,I’m sure my Mom will be over the top.
23379,When she let me into all their lives 8 years ago she even goes overboard for my birthday every year.
23380,I never had my birthday celebrated until they took me under their wing
23381,Thank you!
23382,Thank you!
23383,Thank you!
23384,"I won’t be posting any more updates here, once I tell everyone thank you on this post I’ll be leaving the sub."
23385,I had another commenter tell me I shouldn’t be in this sub anymore because I have a Mom and Dad now.
23386,Thank you!
23387,If it helps I cried when I woke up before 8 to
23388,Thank you!
23389,Thank you!!
23390,!
23391,Thanks I love it 🥰
23392,***My phone screen is broken so I have to use voice to text mostly right now and using punctuation is not the easiest so I was going back to edit my previous comment and add them in and I accidentally just went ahead and hit send instead.
23393,I feel the need to explain that (as well as add another comment that practically has no punctuation whatsoever*this*) rather than have you think that I've never heard of a comma or period .
23394,"(or, you know, just going back and, idk, fixing it?"
23395,"LOL)
Additionally, I guess you're just going to have to trust me on all this, because- and I really do apologize- I'm not going to fix this one all that much either."
23396,A lil bit!!
23397,But not much.
23398,"(And if I am to accidentally hit send again .. well hey, just in case that happens I'll apologize ahead of time)


Lol #lazyasfuqqq"
23399,"True, you’re right."
23400,Honestly I probably shouldn’t be in any sub similar to this either.
23401,I’m sorry I even posted this update that was disrespectful of me.
23402,I won’t post or comment here anymore.
23403,Thank you too all the Moms the last few days.
23404,❤️❤️❤️❤️ they love you sooo much!
23405,I love your new improved parents!
23406,They are so awesome
23407,I'm so happy you have a forever home!
23408,!
23409,Read the first parts of your story on “bestofreddit” this morning.
23410,I feel my day is complete after this update.
23411,Thanks for sharing.
23412,"Please, give me more of this."
23413,So beautiful.
23414,"This made me smile too, even though I'm sobbing reading your beautiful story!"
23415,"Congratulations on your beautiful chosen family, I'm so happy for you, sweet internet stranger :''')"
23416,It was so thoughtful of you to do it that way!
23417,I'm sure they'll cherish that experience forever.
23418,So much love all around!
23419,Also almost a bit envy because my name comes from deimos (means terror iirc)
23420,Most welcome!
23421,😇
23422,>Thank you!
23423,You're welcome!
23424,I hope life in general continues to exceed your expectations.
23425,:)
23426,"I am quite sure there is no “hopefully” about it, from the reactions you’ve described and the fact they were up all night coming up with something."
23427,🥰
23428,You're welcome!
23429,"You deserve so much love and happiness, may the rest of your life be the best of your life !"
23430,That’s really special.
23431,And that feeling is amazing.
23432,Congratulations on having a family AND feeling like part of it!
23433,"That all sounds perfectly normal/natural to me, to be honest."
23434,"It’s been a massive few days for you, you’ve made a decision that is changing your name, and even good news can be overwhelming when you’re not expecting it."
23435,"Fortunately, from everything you’ve told us about them, you couldn’t possibly be in better hands than you are with Mom and Dad."
23436,I’m sure you won’t need to verbalize everything for them to be able to understand and help you really wrap your head around everything that’s just happened and find your equilibrium.
23437,You’re gonna be just fine.
23438,😊
23439,"You're not going to ruin anyone's investment, because what we're invested in here is helping you be happy!"
23440,>Thank you!!
23441,You're welcome!
23442,Oh wow I'm getting a bit teary just reading this.
23443,These people are special and have so much love to share!
23444,All the best to you and your new family 🥰
23445,"Oh, sweetie."
23446,You've endured so much and you're finally home.
23447,Of course it brings up emotions.
23448,Not at all!
23449,The update is well deserved and definitely a part of this subreddit.
23450,It shows your growth and that's what moms really want to see.
23451,Congratulations on the new name
23452,I did not intend it that way at all.
23453,Sorry if that's how it came across.
23454,I meant it as a congratulations.
23455,"Me too, it’s an emotion I’m not sure how to process."
23456,I’m starting to hit a point where all the feelings are too much and I’m just crying.
23457,Not from regret or anything just purely overwhelmed with emotions
23458,You’re welcome 😊
23459,Thank you 😊
23460,"True I didn’t really think about it that way, they they stayed up deciding"
23461,I hope they’re happy with me too 😊
23462,Thanks 😊
23463,"Yea that’s true, they’ll be able to tell something is off with me in the morning, I just hope I can calm myself down enough to sleep tonight."
23464,I’m currently just pacing in the spare bedroom trying to like “use” my emotions somehow.
23465,Thank you 😊
23466,They’re having me and my dog spend a few more nights here with them (I only live a few minutes away) because they don’t want me to go home and shut down mentally from how much emotion has been stirred up the last 48 hours.
23467,"Part of me wants to decline and be independent but part of me knows I’ll shut down and seclude myself, so it’s calming to know my Mom and Dad are willing to take care of me for a few days until I get my emotions regulated again."
23468,"As happy as I am, I know I’m reaching my max of the emotional roller coaster I can handle"
23469,I just don’t want to make anyone upset or anything so it’s probably best I just don’t post anymore.
23470,"I appreciate all the love the last few days, and I’ll just go to the TooAfraidToAsk sub to post any questions or struggles I’m having when it comes to Mom and Dad."
23471,Just because I’m getting adopted doesn’t mean my trauma and insecurities are manically healed.
23472,I’m still gonna struggle sometimes but I’ll find a different community for support
23473,I'd imagine all the emotions would be pretty overwhelming.
23474,Crying is a good way to deal with it.
23475,And now you have a family to hug you and dry your tears!
23476,!
23477,I think it's obvious they are !
23478,"Your dad in particular seems to be pretty well tuned in to you, so yeah, I think they’ll be able to figure out a lot without you even saying anything (not that communication isn’t always important, of course, but when words fail, I think they’ll be pretty clueful)."
23479,I wouldn’t worry about that too much.
23480,"If you have a favorite form of exercise, it might not be a bad idea to really get a good workout in tomorrow to help your body release some of the energy of the last few days."
23481,But it can also be helpful just listen to your body’s signals.
23482,"If you’re tired, rest."
23483,"If you’re amped up, find a way to use that energy."
23484,"If you’re hungry, eat…if you’re not, don’t force yourself."
23485,Same with sleep.
23486,And don’t judge it.
23487,Your body knows what it needs even when your brain has no clue.
23488,"Journaling could be interesting, too, if that feels right—getting all those emotions out on paper helps them feel more like something that’s a part of us, but not all of us, if that makes sense."
23489,But that’s enough of me spitballing.
23490,You’ll do what feels right and this weird OMG WHAT JUST HAPPENED phase will work it’s way through.
23491,😊
23492,"My wife has an expression: ""Lean in."""
23493,"When you're overwhelmed with emotions and not sure how to navigate them, lean in to those who are there to support  you."
23494,"You've got this, and they've got you."
23495,The hard part is I’m not good at admitting I need help.
23496,"So I’m in the spare bedroom with my dog crying in bed, and my parents are in their room."
23497,"I’ll survive the night, I don’t want to bother them or wake them up"
23498,Insecure me will worry about that from time to time
23499,"Yea I’m ready for things to settle a little

Edit; and yes my Dad is insanely aware of my emotions, he picks up on changes even before I do sometimes."
23500,I don’t even know what’s wrong yet and he’s already knows something is wrong
23501,I'm sure it must be hard on you to rely on other people.
23502,"I can tell you though, as a mom, if either of my kids needed me I wouldn't care what the time was."
23503,"Both my children are adopted, and it is my great joy to be there for them in their moments of triumph and in their moments of sorrow."
23504,"Momma of 4 here, chosen and biological, and fellow survivor of abusive home so get feeling like a bother."
23505,The reality is there is nothing that would mean more to me as my young adult’s chosen mom than to get to be trusted to be there for her.
23506,"She struggles with feeling unworthy/not asking for help too and when I find out she was hurting and didn’t reach out to me, i feel like she doesn’t want us, I’m not a good enough mom, and wonder what I could have done more to show her that we mean what we say and she is worth it."
23507,Kids come to their parents rooms when they need comfort in the middle of the night and a normal loving parent delights to be their safe place.
23508,They have said they want you to stay with them so they can support you.
23509,Believe them.
23510,Going to her shows her that you view her as mom and you believe her words that she loves you.
23511,This honors her.
23512,"If you’re still up, consider gently going to your mom and doing your best to tell her."
23513,You could write it down on a sticky note and give to her through tears if it’s too hard to say.
23514,"“Mom, can you hold my hand while I fall asleep?” Or “can I sleep on the floor beside your bed tonight to feel safe?” Don’t feel embarrassed of asking for care."
23515,You are never too old for that.
23516,You are worth it and always have been (should have gotten this as a little girl too- cue all the mixed emotions 😩)  And they sound worthy of the role of being fully your parents.
23517,Much love to you  💕💜
23518,"It's OK to worry , just don't let your worries take over , they wouldn't have made this choice unless they were VERY serious about having you in their lives forever."
23519,"I eventually fell asleep, but they can tell this morning something is off."
23520,I know this because Mom asked “are you having second thoughts?” And I had to completely assure them it’s 0% second thoughts and 100% from too many emotions for 2 straight days and just needed to center myself
23521,I ended up falling asleep before you posted this.
23522,They noticed I’m a little not myself this morning when I came downstairs.
23523,"Mom Immediately asked me if I was having second thoughts, I told her I had 0% second thoughts and that I feel like I’m overwhelmed with 48 hours of a lot of extreme emotions and just want to settle myself."
23524,She was in the middle of finishing cooking breakfast and Dad was waiting for coffee to finish so he came and sat on the couch with me and put an arm around me and let my lean against him for a while.
23525,"He asked why I didn’t wake them up and I said I didn’t want to bother them, Dad assured me the point of me staying here a couple days is so I have 24/7 access for them to help me through this."
23526,That’s a good point
23527,Yay for communicating that so well to them!
23528,That is well said.
23529,I celebrate your courage and self awareness to explain that clearly to them and also communicate your need to settle/center.
23530,Communicating like that is so important because it puts their own insecurities at ease and helps them know how to care for you.
23531,I am proud of you!
23532,You are so brave.
23533,"Relax, deep breaths , this is big change , but it is all good and beautiful."
23534,You have a great future ahead of you !
23535,"Yea apparently they were gonna have all my siblings and their families over for dinner tonight, but Mom said that she wants to wait into I’m not so overwhelmed."
23536,So she’s gonna give it a few more days.
23537,"I told her she didn’t have to do that, but she insisted that if I need to lay low for a few days and settle my emotions then for right now we’re just going to enjoy the three of us and have a few calm days"
23538,"It definitely feels like a long 48 hours, I’m glad Dad suggested My dog and I stay at their house a few more days and lay low and let them take care of me while I work through some emotions."
23539,I think him and Mom are afraid the roller coaster I’ve been on is going to get to me and I’ll crash emotionally.
23540,Lucky I live close enough it’s like 3-5 minutes to get to my house so staying with them isn’t a big deal.
23541,That's awesome!
23542,Enjoy the puppy cuddles and just take some time to process your emotions.
23543,I'm sure you are having lots of big feelings right now.
23544,"They are ALL valid , be patient with yourself as you process this."
23545,"All change can be upsetting to a degree, even when it's good change ."
23546,Yea there’s definitely lots of emotions and when we left the lawyers office Dad noticed I was quiet so that’s when he suggested I let them take care of me for a few days so I can just exist and work through emotions and not be alone (I tend to shut down emotionally if I’m alone too much then it takes them a week or two to help me get back to normal)
23547,That's beautiful that they take care of you like that !
23548,You are so lucky to have them !
23549,"I struggle still to let them, but when I don’t fight them on it they seem to genuinely enjoy making sure I’m ok."
23550,"They do the same with their other kids, even at their other kids ages is not uncommon for one of them to hangout for a day or two when having a tough emotional time."
23551,Even their spouses and kids come to stay with them.
23552,My parents naturally have caregiver personalities so the thrive off all of us letting them take care of us in different ways
23553,That's just so heartwarming.
23554,"They sound like amazing people, I'm so glad you have them in your life !"
23555,♥️
23556,I owe them everything
23557,"Give yourself credit too , all relationships have 2 sides and you contribute to the relationship as well."
23558,"I struggle to see what they get out of it other than a broken, abused, traumatized kid who struggles to trust their love most days."
23559,I’ve gotta be hard to love
23560,"And yet they love you , and you give them love and that's a beautiful thing !"
23561,"No love or relationship is perfect , no humans are perfect."
23562,All we can do is meet each other in our imperfection with love and understanding and it sounds like they know that.
23563,"There is amazing beauty and grace in meeting someone just where they are and loving them just as they exist without conditions or pretense, it's also a rare gift."
23564,When you have this type of love you will blossom in ways you have never imagined.
23565,This is so true AND so beautifully said!
23566,Damned straight.
23567,"I'd do it for any woman,  regardless of age."
23568,"Young men, too."
23569,"I did this for an unsuspecting group of teen girls in Hobby Lobby that were being circled by three guys with strange clothes, a stranger demeanor and no shopping cart."
23570,Only one of girls had noticed the men but they agreed when I told them to ask a male employee at the register to walk them out.
23571,When I was checking out I overheard some employees discussing the girls and I piped up to ask if someone escorted them to their car.
23572,I was so relieved when they said yes and my feelings of being sketched out were confirmed when the employee said the men walked out shortly afterwards without buying anything.
23573,"I'm barely old enough to pull off Mom for a teen, but I will happily answer to aunt, sister, friend, or any variation thereof."
23574,I will gladly rescue any of my little Ducklings.
23575,I love you.
23576,❤️
23577,Shieldmaiden Ace Mama here.
23578,I'll do more than let you chill with me.
23579,I'll fuck someone up for you.
23580,"I'm small and generally live angry for several reasons, but I've got your back, no matter your gender."
23581,For sure.
23582,"Doesn’t matter who’s with me or if it’s nobody, what I’m doing, what kind of day I’m having."
23583,I’ll never not be available for this.
23584,":) Boys, too, not just girls."
23585,Fuck that.
23586,I'll be your mom if you're a teenager.
23587,Or if you're 2 years younger than me.
23588,Or if you're old enough to be my grandma.
23589,Creepiness knows no bounds.
23590,Or if you're a man.
23591,Or if you're non-binary.
23592,"I know as a young (21) man it's not really my place to comment on this sub or this post specifically, I've been a lurker for a long time now, but I have a tiny story like this."
23593,A young teenaged girl came up to me when I was out celebrating a friend getting his driver's license and I was waiting for our drink order to bring it to my friends.
23594,"She held my arm, called me dad and told me to send the weird man away."
23595,"Thankfully I had a beard so it was believable haha, but I felt for the girl very much in that moment."
23596,"I helped her without hesitation, and I'd do it for anyone if the situation comes up again."
23597,"I haven't met her since, but she got home safe, she texted me that night."
23598,I hope she's doing well nowadays.
23599,Absolutely!!!
23600,"Trust your gut , reach out for help- we got you!"
23601,Always.
23602,And not just young ladies.
23603,Anyone.
23604,"Honestly, these days I'm just a bundle of jangling anger held together by nicotine, caffeine and tin foil."
23605,"I wouldn't just protect you (and by you I mean anyone feeling threatened for any reason), I'd go full screaming Karen on the creep's ass."
23606,And it would help my mental health.
23607,Just imagine the release?
23608,Sounds like bliss....
23609,"If you yell  out mom at a grocery store or any store really, several women will look in your direction."
23610,I remember that happening several times as a kid and always getting shy.
23611,Lol
23612,Walk up to any woman.
23613,We know the look.
23614,"I will immediately respond ""WHERE?!"
23615,"HOLD YOUR BROTHERS HAND FOR A MINUTE, I GOT THIS"" in my very best batman/mom voice

Which is very intimidating I've been told"
23616,"I am 31, married, three kids, not stalked by creeps but this is still making my heart swell with how sweet and amazing this is."
23617,"I can’t really explain how it feels to know that I kinda always have someone to help me, even when I don’t think I need it."
23618,It's girl code.
23619,Of course I'd help anyone who ran up to me and said that.
23620,Once I was in a 7-11 and a drunk man there spent like 3 minutes just talking about my ass.
23621,"I looked around for someone who could do this for me (I was 18) and everyone there (a middle aged lady, 2 thirty year old guys, a cashier, etc) were avoiding eye contact with me and it was possibly the loneliest I ever was."
23622,Thanks to anyone who does this to someone else in their moment of need
23623,Not just teen girls.
23624,I'd happily help out a young man or non binary person if they need it too.
23625,"You're all my babies, and I'll fight for you."
23626,"Feel free to flag me down in a crowd, mutter under your breath that you are in an unsafe situation and I will automatically become any array of Aunt, BFF, Sis, or whatever I conjure."
23627,I will walk with you arm in arm and get you safe.
23628,"Please know this, predators are cowards, so you have to be loud and clear, yell ""why are you following me?"
23629,""", ""pervert"", while in public those bastards are really weak and get spooked easily."
23630,"Of course come to me as I’m your mother, I promise you won’t be alone until I get you to your parents and or the proper authorities, don’t worry that creep wouldn’t even dare to come close to you while I’m watching you."
23631,"This I tell my kids, also I tell them -pull the fire alarm-, -climb on a table, disrupt anything you might need to-, don’t worry of consequences, I’ll deal with that later, the priority is your integrity."
23632,"**ADULTS** please let your kids know that if they call, you won’t snap, you won’t yell, you won’t ask, you just will be there, a year ago there was this horrible murder of a young girl 17, she realized she was being kidnapped by the taxi driver, she had time and opportunity (45 minutes) to message someone, she contacted a friend, as young as her who didn’t know what to do, instead of contacting her mother and the police."
23633,"Her mother seems like a POS, so I guess she thought she would be yelled at, I think the mother is a POS due that her daughter didn’t get home on Saturday and she waited until Monday afternoon to go to her daughter’s work and ask about her…"
23634,this really happened to my husband and me.
23635,"a few years ago, we were out at a bar to see some live music."
23636,This wasn’t a crazy bar but a place with a tiny stage and a few tables.
23637,"We don’t know what precipitated it because everything seemed fine, but all of a sudden a young lady sat down and said,”Hi, mom and dad.”

I said, “Hi Sweetheart,” and hubs said,”hey hon!” Then I asked her to walk to the bathroom with me… but some of the staff and i helped her with a safe exit out of the back door (not a public exit) and the bouncer walked her to her car."
23638,We had never met her and never saw her again
23639,"Sadly, I can already see how this advice would get exploited by the wrong kids for internet points."
23640,"On a serious note, when I was 17, I was doing a bit of shopping at the mall when I stopped into a bookstore."
23641,An older lady approached me and explained that I was being followed by a man and to be cautious.
23642,"She had genuine concern for me and was very loud about the man, even pointing directly at him."
23643,"When I was 13 and taking an evening stroll in my neighborhood, a woman literally begged to give me a ride home out of fear and concern that I would get attacked or abducted."
23644,She claimed that she had been attacked recently and was afraid for my safety.
23645,"Despite the fact that females seem to have always hated me and are competitive, there have been a few instances of kindness from a handful in my 47 years."
23646,"I look out for everyone, however, young girls I feel instinctively protective over."
23647,You can say that to me & I don't even have kids.
23648,I got you baby girl.
23649,Absolutely.
23650,"Whatever your gender, I would love to help if I can."
23651,Unless the strange woman is Ghislaine Maxwell 😱
23652,"Any time, any place, any one, 💯!!!!"
23653,!
23654,"Also people with bobby pins on hat or other external layers it used to be a sign for lgbt allies so don't be affraid to ask them for help too, act like friends and no worries we got you (I actually scared off bad peeps more than ones by just being next to my friend and looking mean even though I believe that I'm a nice person)"
23655,What about guys?
23656,"We can get harassed and stalked too, you know."
23657,:(
23658,"When I was 13 (small town, very safe usually) I was allowed to go to the mall for two hours on my own, I was so excited to be trusted and allowed to be a little teenager, until I noticed an older man following me from store to store."
23659,"I got so scared, I tried to go to different stores but he was always 20 feet behind me, he took pictures of me and I totally panicked!"
23660,"I saw a mom with her school aged kid and ran to her, told her that he was following and taking pics of me (this was before cell phones were popular, he legit had a disposable Kodak) she grabbed me with both arms and told me I was going to be ok and I was her daughter now."
23661,We walked around for another 20 minutes and the dude finally bolted.
23662,Scariest moment of my young life.
23663,Still creeped out to think some old dude has hundreds of pics of kids from the mall….
23664,I had to do this when I was younger.
23665,"A creepy guy was following me around a restuarant, I moved several times with my food and my things and he wouldn't stop."
23666,"I saw a mom with her young kids and I slid into the seat next to the moment and said: ""Hiiii, it's been so loong!"""
23667,Like I knew her.
23668,I saw creepy guy sit right across from us.
23669,"I whispered to her:

""This guy has been following me and it's freaking me out."
23670,"Can I wait and walk out with you and your kids while I call my mom to come get me?"""
23671,"She looked up, she got this enraged look and told me it was fine."
23672,"So, I called my folks, my mom kicked it into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE and I'm pretty sure blew a stop sign to come get me."
23673,"And when I pointed out my mom's car, the lady and her kids got up and walked me out."
23674,"(We were at burger king)

And I practically fell into my mom's car to get away."
23675,"Yes, anyone, anytime."
23676,"Anyone, anywhere, anytime."
23677,Never hesitate to ask for help.
23678,We have all been there.
23679,Absolutely!
23680,"In a heartbeat, Honey."
23681,"No questions, no hesitation."
23682,Problem is I have very unique coloring for the place where i live and I look nothing like the people here so idk if this would work for me :(
23683,I apologize on behalf of all creepy men.
23684,I hate em too
23685,Girl code.
23686,"Protect any woman, any where, any time, from creepy men"
23687,Seriously.
23688,"Call me Auntie, call me any name you can think of, if a strange person comes up and pretends to know me, I will pretend back and help you out."
23689,I've been harassed by creeps enough.
23690,I won't let it happen to anyone else
23691,Same for the sisters here!
23692,Please come up to me and I will be your sister and keep you safe!
23693,This older lady will be a mama tigress for you.
23694,Anytime.
23695,"As a former young lady who actually heard variations on these phrases more than I wish to recall:

“Well, you said No, but you didn’t hit me”

“When a girl punches me, then I know she means No.”


When this tigress is done, they’ll know the meaning of 

NO

Edit: format"
23696,This goes for Dads as well.
23697,No one needs to be hassled/harassed.
23698,I look young but come up and I'll get ya to your car/bus stop/ whatever gets you home safely.
23699,Would this work for trans men too?
23700,I don’t like how people see me as a fetish
23701,"If ANY man, boby included, harrassing you!"
23702,There is no fury like a mama protecting her babies!
23703,So beautiful I told my grandma this and she completely agrees .
23704,I‘m always ready for this kind of event and on the lookout to get proactive if someone regardless of gender seems to be bothering another woman or girl.
23705,"Even though I’m not old enough the be seen as a mother, I’ll do the „Hey bestie!"
23706,Long time no see!
23707,How are you?“ or „Hi Sis!
23708,Are you ready to go?“ thingy.
23709,"So to add onto that tipp: when no one is around that would be old enough to be your mom or grandma, grab yourself another girl or, even better, a large group of other girls and pretend they’re your sister or besties"
23710,"Aunties, too."
23711,One million percent!
23712,"Should also post this on r/lpt, r/dadforaminute"
23713,There is nothing I am doing that is more important than helping out.
23714,No matter how busy we look - bother us and we will help.
23715,Guaranteed.
23716,Addressing a lady as Auntie Whatever is also an option.
23717,It is actually plausible no matter what the age difference or lack of resemblance.
23718,I'll Aunt for anyone!
23719,So much this
23720,"Mom, Sis, Aunt, friend, cousin, next door neighbor, or whatever!"
23721,We've all been there and know how scary it can be.
23722,I have absolutely zero problem helping anyone out!
23723,"If you do this to me in public or even private feeling unsafe, I got news for you: im your mom/auntie/older sister/college room mate etc."
23724,Regardless of your sex or orientation or age.
23725,"Anyone can be abducted, assaulted, trafficked etc."
23726,Everyone deserves to be safe.
23727,Except Vladimir Putin.
23728,That's great advice.
23729,100%
23730,Yes this!!
23731,"If any young person comes up to me and says ""hey mom/auntie/big sis!"
23732,"I need help!"""
23733,I'll have my shoe off my foot and flying across the room so fast the creep won't know what hit them.
23734,Stay safe out there people
23735,"I like to ask the creeps “so whose dad are you?”

It reminds them that they’d dirty predators while prompting them to verbally establish that no appropriate relationship exists for them to be bucking up on ppl young enough to be their descendants."
23736,"I’ve been a “Old Friend” to a couple of women my age before, I tend to just stand up and fold my arms, give the harasser a look."
23737,Helps that I wear black a lot and am tall for a girl.
23738,Plus I carry a pretty little emerald green pocket knife in my purse.
23739,😊
23740,❤❤❤❤
23741,"Um, this seems like last-resort advice."
23742,"Women aren’t all good people, and anyway if someone did this to me my very confused response would be “I’m not your mom” because I don’t cope with surprises well."
23743,"Sounds like a good way to get an innocent older girl involved in some mad bullshit, possibly endangering her."
23744,"Better to approach a group if possible, or a strong looking man."
23745,"FR, you wanna say ""BECKY HEEEYYY How are you doing??"
23746,"How are the girls?"""
23747,I gotchu fam
23748,this is amazing!
23749,and absolutely!
23750,"any of you girls, guys, seriously!"
23751,"ANYONE, out there feeling unsafe, please please do this!"
23752,"I would be more than happy to help you out, and I would hope, if I was in that situation (again) a mama would do that for me!"
23753,it could potentially save someone's life!
23754,"and I agree, age doesn't matter either!"
23755,just do it!
23756,I've been in a situation like this where I could have used someone who would have done this for me!
23757,"everyone stay safe out there, and it wouldn't hurt to carry a whistle or pepper spray!"
23758,here for you ALL ❤❤❤
23759,Honestly i feel like walking up to a guy and saying Dad!
23760,This strange man is following me!
23761,Might work better
23762,[deleted]
23763,Thank you.
23764,"So many are so comfortable in their safe world, they couldn’t even imagine anything like that."
23765,Evil is always out there.
23766,"We don’t want it, but still must be vigilant."
23767,"Look around, always be brave."
23768,I was just about to say something similar.
23769,"When I lived in Tacoma, creeps would follow me or harass me all the time."
23770,"The best course of action was always to jus go up to a group of girls, or a family, and just say something like, ""there's a creep following me, would it be ok if I just sort of chill here with you for a minute?"""
23771,Yes!
23772,"I'm not small (5'10"" 160lbs) but I absolutely do live angry and quick to snap also for several reasons."
23773,I have absolutely zero problem fucking somebody up for harassment.
23774,I also am the oldest of 8 (4 lil sisters 3 lil brothers).
23775,I've had alot of practice!
23776,Thank you for being there for her!
23777,I’m proud of you!
23778,Great job DAD!!!
23779,:)
23780,Fellow dude (actual dad of 4 😍).
23781,Thank you for sharing and helping that girl!
23782,I like to think if my daughter—or sons!—were to approach a stranger and looking for help that there are enough good samaritans out there to oblige.
23783,Stories like yours makes me believe!
23784,Same.
23785,I'm not above scaring some random guy if it means protecting someone.
23786,I'm sure I have a deeper voice than whatever creep is harassing you does too.
23787,Not the same.
23788,"But I took my kids to a park to play, and then sat down on a picnic table under an awning."
23789,"Another mom went nuts on me, saying I walked up with an attitude and sat down like I owned the fucking place."
23790,She thew a mcdonalds cup at me as she walked away.
23791,Every other parent at the picnic tables said/did nothing.
23792,Didn't even make eye contact with me.
23793,Pretended not to notice the nut head yelling at me.
23794,"Like, hello?"
23795,"So much for ""a village."""
23796,I am so sorry this happened to you.
23797,I can't stand to see anything like this happen to anyone in my presence and not say something.
23798,I don't understand people that can clearly hear and see harassment happening and do nothing.
23799,I hope nothing like this happens to you again.
23800,❤❤
23801,Hell I had to do this recently for a lady older than me at the store.
23802,She was getting her stuff and I saw a guy following her for a few aisles and when her back was turned I saw him walking towards her cart.
23803,Her purse was open.
23804,"I bolted over, grabbed her cart and pretended she was my mom rushing it over to her."
23805,"""That guy's trying to steal your bag."""
23806,I whispered.
23807,"""He's been following you around the store."""
23808,"She thanked me, asked me to 'go get something' while I snuck away to go rejoin my actual mother."
23809,And by snuck away I mean doing the Winter Soldier Murder Strut and glaring daggers at people.
23810,"Good thing she's in jail, but.. Yeah."
23811,"Unfortunately, there are some like that."
23812,"Still, the chances are low enough, and just don't get in a stranger's car (even if they just helped you)."
23813,"If they won't let you call a taxi, that's not a good sign."
23814,Or Myra Hindley.
23815,Come up to me and tell me you’re not safe and I’m here for you.
23816,"I know all the cafes in town as well, we can wait them out"
23817,Easy.
23818,You're adopted.
23819,It really doesn't matter.
23820,Point is that the creep will know you know AND that you've alerted someone to them.
23821,Creeps don't care if you're actually related to someone.
23822,They care about getting caught.
23823,Then pretend they’re your friend :)
23824,"Yes, works for everyone who needs help"
23825,"So quite quaint i toldeth mine own grandma this and the lady completely agrees

***



^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)"
23826,"Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`"
23827,"Well that's the thing,  isn't it?"
23828,This isn't a surprise anymore.
23829,"That's why stuff like this gets posted, to raise awareness."
23830,"It isn't as if the original poster thinks everyone who is ever in trouble will be able to specifically call her out as mom, but by posting this, has informed several of the plan to better protect those who need protected."
23831,"Now, hopefully, you wouldn't have the knee-jerk reaction of ""I am not your mom""."
23832,"You would, hopefully, recognize that this person calling you mom does not feel safe, and is hoping your presence will help."
23833,"So now, if it happens to you, you know how to respond."
23834,Yes?
23835,Yes?
23836,?
23837,I carry a .38 or a 9mm..
23838,I've got you covered.
23839,No guarantee a guy would understand though.
23840,They would probably be more likely to go uh sweetie you've got me confused for someone else.
23841,Or they might be dangerous as well.
23842,Usually much safer to go up to a woman sadly\~
23843,God bless that woman and little girl.
23844,Hope they are still safe and well.
23845,"That video was fake btw, it was posted by a Tik Toker who makes hundreds of those types of videos."
23846,But I suppose it can still serve as an example of being situationally aware and helping  out those in an otherwise defenseless situation.
23847,In the moment it doesn’t feel brave so much as basic instinct.
23848,Stuff like this is why it’s terrifying having a daughter.
23849,I had her with me that day in the shopping cart and got scared initially.
23850,Then I was *pissed*- I always roll my eyes at those mama bear stickers but when you are in that scenario it really feels like you could rip someone apart if it came down to it.
23851,Locked eyes with one of the men and gave him an eat shit look.
23852,"I can’t describe it, but in that moment he knew that I knew."
23853,"They were walking in patterns that didn’t make sense, would go down the same aisle as me or the teen girls and pretend to look at something then put it back, walked past way too close multiple times, etc."
23854,I had enough of them circling us and called my bf (who luckily works in a building two minutes from the store) to come walk me and our daughter out to the car.
23855,Traffickers also commonly target women with young children as they have their back turned putting them in the car seat.
23856,After calling him I approached the girls and told them I’m not sure who the men were after but something was very wrong with the situation and they needed to be escorted to their car.
23857,"Obviously can’t prove the mens’ intentions but it was pretty damning that they left shortly after the girls without buying anything, after aggressively “shopping” for twenty minutes or so."
23858,Yep!
23859,"And if there's no group/family/mom-type around, you can go into a store or restaurant (whatever happens to be open), tell the employees the same, and they'll usually look out for you."
23860,"I've done this many times, because I'm somehow more comfortable asking employees if I can hang out in their store for a few min until the dude wanders off than ""bothering"" random people who are just walking."
23861,Ofc this was in Tacoma
23862,"I'm in too - 5'11, a big girl with 3 younger sisters, hair trigger temper when someone messes with smaller people in my vicinity."
23863,"I'm like a t shirt I saw recently - I'm sage, and hood and I wish a motha would."
23864,Thank you!
23865,I appreciate it.
23866,I wanted to be a father one day ever since I was 12 and that day reassured me of it.
23867,I hope they meet the right people if it ever comes to that!
23868,Kids need and deserve protection
23869,"I mean, I didn’t call the cops or anything."
23870,Just posted something in my insta story and hours later I got a DM from a person I used to go to school with asking what the guy looked like and how she was harassed in the same shopping center and the man threatened to rape her and her friends.
23871,Adults around ignored her too except a 19 year old guy who distracted the man while the girls ran.
23872,That feels like my fault.
23873,I could have called the police and they could have arrested the guy for public intoxication if nothing else.
23874,"Because I just ran out, more people got hurt and that feels like my fault."
23875,I might as well have been a bystander
23876,"Yep I probably will, or more likely call my ""boyfriend,"" and ask him when he's picking me up

Thanks mom :DD"
23877,I hope I would!
23878,"I mean, even if I did say “I’m not your mom,” I’d still help."
23879,"Assuming every woman would, though?"
23880,That’s a mistake.
23881,"I think it’s bad advice, so no."
23882,Same.
23883,Pretty sure if did this to a women id be looked at like a weirdo 100%
23884,[deleted]
23885,"Oh yes, absolutely this."
23886,I’m a guy but I was being harassed by a person asking me for money; even after telling him I didn’t have any he asked me to go to an ATM in an Asian grocery store and withdraw some.
23887,"I went in - he stayed outside - and I acted like I was at the ATM (which was out of order) and said to the people behind the counter “I’m sorry to bother you, but there’s a man out there and he won’t leave me alone.” They nodded."
23888,"He pokes his head in and I tell him the ATM’s out of order and he starts yelling, then the store people start yelling and he backs off."
23889,"I thanked them and the woman behind the counter (who I presume was the owner) goes “no no, you’re my customer, I protect you”

I was a regular customer from there on out."
23890,🤣🤣 I love it!
23891,💪😎
23892,Aw!
23893,I’m sure you’ll be great ❤️
23894,No no no.... not your fault AT ALL!
23895,We've all been so uncomfortable that we've just wanted out as quick as possible.
23896,"Especially when you are a young woman, feel threatened like that and the cowardly people around you clearly wouldn't do anything to stop him."
23897,It's the man's fault 10000%.
23898,HE CHOSE to be a fucking piece of garbage creep.
23899,Please try not to carry any guilt around bc of a disgusting trash person.
23900,"Calling the cops on him wouldn't have stopped him from harassing the next person, I'm 100% positive about that."
23901,"Just please remember, his behavior and disgusting actions are completely HIS fault."
23902,There is absolutely zero blame on you for what he chooses to be or do.
23903,As long as you’re really calling someone and aren’t pretending.
23904,It’s better when someone knows where you are😊
23905,"Statistically speaking, you are better off asking a stranger on the street (regardless of gender) for help, than facing whatever creep is coming after you alone."
23906,"Just follow ""I'm not your mom"" with ""but if you're in trouble, I'm as good as."""
23907,I'm sorry to hear that.
23908,"If some creep is following you and/or harassing you in public, odds are pretty danged good that whoever you might approach for help is not a creep (because most people are not creeps)."
23909,"Also, if someone approaches you for help, unless you're being asked to do something risky to yourself, most likely you're in no danger."
23910,This mom can help you - two sharp punches to the throat.
23911,I always loved that line from Clueless about the shovel and I doubt anyone would miss you.
23912,"I don’t know, I think most women are so conscious of creeps in public that if *anyone* came up to them, regardless of who they are, and loudly pretended “Hey, how are you, long time no see!” followed by a quiet “Help, this weirdo is following me!"
23913,"Can you help me out?” … yeah, almost every woman would catch on quickly and immediately take you under their wing and try to get you away from the situation you’re in."
23914,I’ve done this exact thing for multiple people over the years.
23915,"The moment someone I don’t know approaches me, wild eyed and frantic and goes “Hey!!"
23916,It’s been so long!” I immediately know to play along and get them as far away from the person targeting them as I can.
23917,"For many women, harassment is just part of life and we’re usually willing to help out anyone that feels unsafe."
23918,***Edited to add:*** My husband has been with me a few of those times and he’s since become so aware of creepy behaviour that he’s actually stepped in without being asked a couple of times when he’s seen someone that’s clearly uncomfortable.
23919,"He stops and goes “Omg, how are you, not seen you for a while!”

Both times the victim immediately responded with the kind of “Oh wow, hi!"
23920,"I’m great, how are you?”

The creeps have immediately backed off because another man is a threat."
23921,"Sucks that it has to be that way but whether man/woman/whoever, we can all help combat those evil bastards!"
23922,"As a trafficking survivor, kidnapping does not always equal trafficking."
23923,I swear some people watch Taken one time...
23924,"If it’s fake it’s fake, that’s not shitting on it just calling it as it is."
23925,You can go to the post and see all the comments about it.
23926,"Like I said though, can still be super helpful in preventing this from happening in real life."
23927,"Just shouldn’t be praised for how brave it is if it was staged

https://www.reddit.com/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/comments/t4pb5i/little_girl_saved_by_woman/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
23928,And this is how you earn customer loyalty.
23929,That's honestly a very good point.
23930,*Most* folks are good people.
23931,Some are creeps.
23932,That’s a little much.
23933,[deleted]
23934,Read the comments in the link.
23935,Not sure how pointing out the video is staged makes me weird and jaded.
23936,Especially when I agreed with the intention of the video as it relates to this post and protecting girls from creeps
23937,"I've been struggling with addiction for a long time, and the realization that every step (however small it might be) counts has been a great epiphany for me."
23938,"Like, even if I don't make it through a whole month sober, there are still the days during that month that I *was* sober, and those count."
23939,"A similar mentality can, and, I think, should, be applied to many situations in life."
23940,"Maybe you didn't clean the whole house like you planned, but you got a load of laundry run and that's something."
23941,"Maybe you didn't meet a deadline at work, but you learned more about how to deal with that type of issue next time."
23942,"Every step is progress, and all progress is valid."
23943,"I needed to see this today 🥺 Been really beating myself up the past couple weeks because I’ll have weeks where I’m super productive and on top of things at work, and other weeks (like this one) where I can barely get myself to send a single email in one day."
23944,It’s really frustrating me and making me feel like something is wrong with myself.
23945,"But I have my cat sitting here on my lap, just happy I’m spending the day with him no matter what I do."
23946,Thank you for sharing this.
23947,Source is Shitty Watercolor @swatercolor.
23948,This is a beautiful reminder that every small step truly does count.
23949,"If you mess up, you have a brand new day to try again."
23950,Also edited to add that we really don’t deserve animals.
23951,They are so wonderful.
23952,This helps.
23953,Thanks.
23954,"Mom, I tried calling you today, but I couldn't work up the courage."
23955,I love you and I'm sorry for being the way I am.
23956,I wish I could come see you but I'm too ashamed of what I am.
23957,I'm sorry mom.
23958,I love you.
23959,Well shit…that was wholesome af.
23960,Love it♥️
23961,"Thanks mom for a minute

23970,I'm feeling really really horrendous atm.
23971,Gone through hell.
23972,Again.
23973,I can barely wash.
23974,I do nothing.
23975,I don't want to do anything.
23976,But this helped a little.
23977,Thank you.
23978,Oh no.
23979,I had no idea this was what shitty watercolour was up to so I checked out his Instagram and accidentally liked a comment from like… years ago.
23980,Does he still post on Reddit?
23981,He refined his style so much from the amateur roald Dahl look he’s really got something going.
23982,"Unfortunately, society does not take kindly to this."
23983,Half arsed is better than no arsed at all.
23984,"In my early sobriety I was literally counting the minutes - ‘have a glass of fizzy water and wait 10 minutes, then see if the urge for wine is still there’."
23985,"Often I found it was not, but it still took me probably two years to get to two weeks sober."
23986,"Every minute, hour, day is a step in your sobriety, and are a gift to yourself, from yourself."
23987,Sending you best wishes for your recovery (I’m at nearly 4 years and that is a miracle to me).
23988,Exactly.
23989,You are a badass for fighting your addiction.
23990,You are incredibly strong.
23991,Petting your cat can actually help your mental health.
23992,You are working on yourself right now.
23993,Great job!
23994,"Just try to do your best, whatever that might be today."
23995,You’re not alone friend.
23996,I’m struggling with the exact same problem at the moment.
23997,I can accomplish so much when I have the drive and energy but when I don’t… I can’t do anything.
23998,I have to be in the office and sometimes I just feel like crying.
23999,I saw something earlier today that caught me off guard.
24000,"“If being hard on yourself worked, it would have worked by now”."
24001,"I’ve been hard on myself my entire life, and it makes things difficult, but seeing that made me do a double take."
24002,Sometimes we just need a bit of compassion for ourselves.
24003,"Sending you as much care and compassion as I can to you, Internet stranger."
24004,"Everyone makes mistakes, even if some people don’t admit theirs."
24005,You just have to try to do the best you can.
24006,I hope things get better for you.
24007,(Hug)
24008,I love you exactly the way you are.
24009,Nothing you could ever do would change that.
24010,Don’t be cruel to yourself.
24011,(Big bear hug)
24012,Try to take care of yourself.
24013,Have you eaten today?
24014,"Try one thing today, just one."
24015,It can be something tiny.
24016,What a great strategy… Congratulation👏🏼👏🏼

24704,I'm getting married soon and I'm going with some cute custom converse.
24705,Since your dress is long like mine you may want to wear some comfortable shoes since no one will be able to see them anyways with the length.
24706,"You've gotten to be such a beautiful woman, your wife will love it, too!"

24734,Personally I think a nice hair piece would work really well with this dress.

24747,"All your love for each other, the love of everyone in attendance, it can be overwhelming but can also be missed if you're too caught up in the plans/movement of the day."
24748,That’s a stunning dress; love the colour and neckline.

24781,Seconding times a million the folks saying EAT - and I will add hydrate like mad to that also.
24782,"Navigating the restroom in a gown kind of sucks but dehydration and headaches are worse, love, I promise."
24783,"If I was coming, I would have a little zipper pouch of tylenol, needle and thread, safety pins, concealer/powder, spare lipstick, hairspray, bobby pins, and a couple band aids to keep nearby, just in case."
24784,"(I know, I am THAT mom)  Maybe someone close to you and your wife can sub in my neurotic self and make an emergency kit for an just in cases, for my peace of mind."
24785,Hahaha.
24786,ENJOY YOUR DAY!
24787,Your dress is beautiful and it really suits you!

25718,I second the don't forget to eat!
25719,"I had to be reminded at mine (divorced now), and didn't get to taste what I heard were really good desserts!"
25720,And you look beautiful!
25721,"One thing we're doing is putting the maid of honour and best man on guard duty - people have good intentions and want to come up to congratulate you, but you need a chance to eat some food in peace!"
25722,"This is the most expensive meal you're likely to have if you're paying for the guests, you need a chance to enjoy it!"
25723,MOH and best man can gently redirect people to come back during the dancing.
25724,"Also, drink white wine or other clear drinks so you don't end up with a big red stain when you inevitably drip."
25725,Not speaking from experience at all.
25726,"Also take a few minutes every now and then to just stand still and take it all in, congratulations on the wedding, the dress looks beautiful."
25727,And don't forget to drink water!
25728,"You'll be running around all day, so even if you don't cry from the emotions of the day, you're likely to get a bit dehydrated."
25729,Yes!
25730,If you can have a close friend or talk to the caterer so they can help you guys get a moment to sit and not be bothered!
25731,When I got married the venue had their own event planner who guarded our table when it was time for food and made sure no one came up to us.
25732,She even boxed up the leftovers!
25733,"Also pack a travel size of tylenol or advil, even happy events can bring on stress headaches!❤️"
25734,"if you’re wearing it and you’re the bride, it is officially bridal!"
25735,and I loveee this look so much
25736,Thank you!
25737,!
25738,May you have a long and happy life together.
25739,❤️❤️
25740,"Wow, that sounds beautiful!"
25741,"Again, congratulations and I hope you’re as happy as you are beautiful."
25742,💍
25743,How about something like this?
25744,"https://www.etsy.com/listing/1168959157/bridal-wedding-shoes-with-heels-in-gold

You could wear these again by dressing up a pair of jeans for date night."

25762,That's going to finalize the look and elevate the magic.
25763,Enjoy your big day
25764,🌺
25765,I'm sure you will.
25766,I know that you will be beautiful on the day.
25767,Your Texas Mom is sending you both love and hugs and prayers for a happy marriage and a wonderful life.
25768,I'm not gonna lie i wear or around my house.
25769,It was held up by 100 bobby pins and I wore it all night.
25770,I paid too much not to wear it.

25787,"🤍💙

You're welcome!"
25788,I also had to hear how great the food was at my first wedding!
25789,My mother insisted I be a good host and speak to every single person there (300+) then it was time for cake and toasts and dances.
25790,I wound up in a McDonald’s drive thru in my wedding gown @ 2am.
25791,Explaining mustard stains to the dry cleaner was hilarious.
25792,"Second time I knew better, I sat and ate and enjoyed my new husband."
25793,Your guest can wait while y’all eat and enjoy some downtime.
25794,Don’t be like me all hangry at the end of the night.
25795,This is you and your wife’s day.
25796,Eat that food you’re paying so much for!
25797,Have someone in charge of gathering some to-go containers for you and your wife so you can chill and enjoy a meal later.
25798,Congrats!
25799,Your dress looks great and your hair is so nice and shiny!
25800,Thank you!
25801,!
25802,Thank you!
25803,I’m over the moon with happiness!
25804,"Oh, but maybe purple heels would be cool with an amethyst crown."
25805,"https://www.etsy.com/listing/180040288/purple-sequin-3-heels

That's a nice heel size for a long night of dancing at the reception."
25806,"Edit: on second thought, I don't think the sequins compliment the lace."
25807,What was I thinking?
25808,I'm having a great time internet shopping.
25809,Thank you!
25810,!
25811,Thank you!
25812,Thank you!!

25816,I’ll post pictures after the wedding!!
25817,!
25818,Thank you!
25819,!
25820,Literally laughing out loud picturing mustard stains and your attempt to explain this to a dry cleaner here.
25821,"Hahaha I pictured a bride with her bare feet propped up on the dashboard enjoying a BigMac, whilewatching a Netflix series at the parking lot of a Mc Donald's."
25822,Yay!
25823,She was actually a friend of the family and her gift to me was cleaning and preserving my dress.
25824,When I brought it in she looked at me and deadpan said “I should have gotten you the blender” before she cracked up!
25825,We had the entire store laughing when I re-enacted my mom dragging me around to meet her friends who I’d never seen before and would never meet again.
25826,This was back when Netflix was dvds in little red paper envelopes.
25827,"(Just aged myself hard lol) So it was more like scarfing a qtr pounder, speeding down I10 while singing along to The Flaming Lips, and trying to sneak my now ex-husband’s fries."
25828,"This was over 10 years ago but the girl in the window (she’s the GM now) still likes to tell the story of the late night bride who gave everyone on shift a $20 bill unpinned from her (my) veil as a tip, but only after they hummed the wedding March that I conducted with a French fry."
25829,I was extremely tipsy from the whole no food but many toasts situation lol.
25830,It’s the only part of my first wedding I like to talk about haha.
25831,Almost everything else was a comedy of errors.
25832,"From being 45 min late, not having enough  chairs, and the DJ going rouge."
25833,But the piece de resistance was my uncle standing in front of the video camera so it looks like I was saying my vows to a giant ass.
25834,Which as it turned out was very prophetic lol.
25835,"Kiddo, you have a great therapist."
25836,"And if you keep on keepin on with drawing, you will be a great artist."
25837,"Never, ever, ever give up, and never, ever, ever rely on one person's judgement of you xo from a granny"
25838,You have an eye for composition and strong positive/negative space.
25839,"Many ""good"" amateur artists lack that, so don't let that old nagging voice in whatsoever."
25840,"Keep it up, don't ever be afraid to explore new horizons, you're doing amazing."
25841,Anyone can draw.
25842,"Not everyone can draw well, but that shouldn’t stop anyone from having fun."
25843,"That said, you clearly have talent and if this is something you enjoy doing, nurture it."
25844,I think there’s probably a lot that your birth person has said that you shouldn’t believe.
25845,You can draw.
25846,What else was she wrong about?
25847,Btw I think #3 is my favorite
25848,"You, my little duckling, are an ARTIST."
25849,And you have been since the day you picked up a pencil.
25850,My personal favorite is the first one.
25851,I personally know how difficult portraiture can be and I think your work is amazing.
25852,Keep up the fantastic work!
25853,My egg donor told me I couldn’t do a lot of things too.
25854,It takes a lot to repair that damage and I’m proud of you for kicking so many goals
25855,Birth person is a loser with poor taste.
25856,Your use of values is impeccable
25857,Your art is wonderful!
25858,"I especially like #2, it’s intriguing."
25859,Keep drawing ❤️
25860,Your drawings are so lovely!
25861,"I know it’s hard, but try not to worry about the people who rag on things you enjoy."
25862,"Talent is something that grows when it os nurtured, and I’m so glad your therapist is encouraging you to nurture your own talent."
25863,Egg donor was either jealous or didn't appreciate  art.
25864,Or both!
25865,You have a gift!
25866,Explore it!!
25867,!
25868,"Oh wow, I'm so glad you listened to your therapist!"
25869,You obviously have talent.
25870,I'm an artist and I can say that you have a good eye for values -  the contrast between light and dark areas.
25871,And I like your composition of shapes.
25872,Seems like you were drawing your emotions?
25873,I feel that coming through in them.
25874,"Anyway, I wish you luck on your therapy journey toward healing and peace."
25875,And I hope you have a ton of fun on your artistic journey as well.
25876,It can be a lifelong love affair if you let to be :)
25877,What's up with them and saying their kids can't draw?
25878,"When I was 8 perhaps, I began tracing ships and trains."
25879,I liked those big vehicles.
25880,"Oh, and some planes."
25881,She insisted that tracing was not drawing and that I was cheating and wasting my time.
25882,"And yet, I was getting used to the feeling of the pencil on the paper, and how things work."
25883,I was fucking EIGHT.
25884,"After too much criticism, I just stopped."
25885,"I guess I should trace again, for fun, and see if it can lead somwhere, because your drawings, are REALLY cool."
25886,I really like the second one.
25887,It captures something i cant communicate with words but really relate to
25888,Sibling here: You're talented.
25889,You've got a great understanding of conveying planes through values.
25890,Your choices for shadows are well placed.
25891,Whoa.
25892,Like this art.
25893,"I rarely see the inspiration of artists in art, but im seeing through your eyes here."
25894,"Yeah, birth parent was super wrong."
25895,(Not a mom but a sibling!)
25896,Omg these are so good!!
25897,I adore the last one especially  :] thank you for sharing your creativity with us!!
25898,!
25899,That’s beautiful!
25900,Your work is lovely!
25901,Please keep it up!
25902,!
25903,You have a beautiful talent.
25904,Please keep doing it.
25905,That my child is a work of art like yourself.
25906,Mom loves you honey and so proud of your accomplishments and achievements.
25907,Love you to the moon and back dear soul.
25908,Be proud of yourself and the god given talent.
25909,You are a rare and unique and talented person.
25910,We love you.
25911,These are wonderful!
25912,Anyone telling someone they cannot make art well is entirely missing the point of art.
25913,This is amazing.
25914,You have real talent and should use it to make yourself happy and to express yourself.
25915,Ignore your birth person because they are clearly an idiot.
25916,It is a great life policy to not listen to what idiots say about you.
25917,"Their opinions, stupid as they are, are not your business."
25918,So ignore them.
25919,We had to do that with my FIL regarding my Hub's art.
25920,FIL had almost no impact on our life and now?
25921,I don't even speak to him.
25922,He literally isn't worth the cost of a phone call on my unlimited everything plan.
25923,your art is amazing!
25924,i’m glad you have your therapist to encourage you in your craft ❤️
25925,I took up drawing during the pandemic & I can tell you right now that you are miles & miles ahead of where I was when I started!
25926,"Please keep it up, you clearly have talent."
25927,I would really like to see you post some more drawings six months from now.
25928,I can’t wait to see where this journey takes you!
25929,Your birth person can't parent
25930,"I'm not a mom (just some guy), but I'm impressed your art style."
25931,"Dark, but not the empty kind of dark."
25932,"It's peaceful, like a candle light in a dark room kinda peaceful."
25933,Idk how else to describe your style.
25934,Never let assholes demean you and your talents.
25935,sibling here—your art made me feel things.
25936,my cPTSD doesn’t often let me feel things.
25937,"thank you, keep making art ♥️"
25938,That is beautiful!!
25939,!
25940,Birth people can be our biggest roadblocks to happiness
25941," I’m an art teacher, so I’m very highly qualified to say:

1."
25942,"This is art, and it’s wonderful."
25943,2.
25944,"You are an artist, and fighting through criticism has only made your art more poignant for it (like, idk, this kinda unknown artist named VAN GOGH, who was ridiculed for his work while alive)."
25945,3.
25946,Your birth person can go sit in syrup.
25947,I’m so proud of you!
25948,!
25949,"Honey, I make my living as a professional illustrator."
25950,I can draw.
25951,YOU CAN TOO.
25952,This is fabulous work.
25953,"My advice: keep drawing, keep doodling."
25954,"It doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be done."
25955,That's how we improve.
25956,And you are starting at a higher level than I did.
25957,"Pro tip: keep some of your early work so you can compare yourself to it -- never to other artists, but to yourself."
25958,You will be amazed at how you grow.
25959,I'm a highly trained artist and I'm telling you that you're good.
25960,The first and last one are really cool
25961,Those are so amazing!
25962,Don’t ever stop drawing❤️ you are talented and creative
25963,"Hun, this is all amazing."
25964,I love the first one!
25965,"Hey sib, I think you're really talented!"
25966,"I especially like #2, it reminds me of how I felt when I first started therapy & started untangling the mess in my head."
25967,"My head still isn't as orderly as I'd like it, but thank you for the reminder of how far I've come."
25968,"❤️

Keep going on your healing journey; I promise it's worth it."
25969,Sibling here!
25970,You have a lot of the basics down and a really keen eye for shading and detail.
25971,Keep practising— you are only going to get better and better from here!
25972,!
25973,"Oooooh, pic #3 is awesome!"
25974,These are beautiful sweetheart.
25975,"But, maybe more importantly, they're so expressive."
25976,"Practice makes perfect, sure, but the creative flare, the deep emotions they instill, that's all you."
25977,It was always inside of you.
25978,I am so happy to see it grow.
25979,"I see a ton of art on reddit, i must say I like yours the most, I feel like there's life behind theses drawings."
25980,I *really* like your artwork.
25981,Just because someone says something about you doesn’t make it true.
25982,This is a great example.
25983,You’re gonna do so great in life!
25984,I’m so proud of you!
25985,I’d brag about you to everyone I know.
25986,So cool!
25987,I love the mask one!
25988,Look at how awesome your drawings are!
25989,Birth person lied.
25990,You draw very well.
25991,Keep up the good work darling!
25992,Proud of you!
25993,!
25994,What beautiful pictures.
25995,"All three of my daughters are artists like you… a good friend of mine recently learned how to draw and actually has the talent, as well."
25996,I love it when people discover and pursue art.
25997,"I wish I could say that I can’t imagine a mother who would stifle and shut down their own child’s talent, but sadly I can."
25998,"Please keep drawing, you’re incredibly good at it."
25999,You have a ridiculous amount of talent!
26000,!
26001,these are amazing
26002,incredible!
26003,!
26004,"Well, obviously you can draw."
26005,Don't let people drag you down because they're dissatisfied with their own accomplishments.
26006,Yours are amazing.
26007,Good style.
26008,Amazing.
26009,I’m truly proud of you.
26010,There’s depth to your art.
26011,Please keep exploring your talent.
26012,Pretty sure every teacher you’ve had was amazed!
26013,"You really can draw, omg I love your drawings."
26014,Would you be willing to share any more of your art?
26015,You’re good.
26016,"Non birth mother here saying you keep going my dear, and you let go of all that hurt in your heart."
26017,It's a weight that does not serve you.
26018,"These are beautiful, and you are loved."
26019,I'm so very proud of you.
26020,Absolutely wow.
26021,"You can draw, honebuns."
26022,I love you!
26023,I hope you don't mind that I'm using the third piece as my phone's wallpaper.
26024,Thanks so much for the beautiful art.
26025,Please keep it up
26026,"You wouldn’t happen to sell prints of these, would you?"
26027,Charcoal is one of my favourite mediums...it's so much fun!
26028,Seriously beautiful work...that first portrait is so gorgeous.
26029,Really good eye for expression and negative space.
26030,"Your talent is natural, nuture it my little chicken ❤"
26031,That first one is so amazing.
26032,It has the “Mona Lisa effect” on me.
26033,It makes me wonder who she is?
26034,What she’s thinking?
26035,What emotions are hidden behind her expression?
26036,"Plus, it’s simply a beautiful face."
26037,Do you mind if I print it out?
26038,Your art is amazing!
26039,We have fallen into this weird trap of thinking we need to monetize our hobbies and we do not.
26040,All 4 of them are excellent.
26041,"They seem to be made with charcoal, and I always felt like charcoal is a difficult but a very expressive media on its own."
26042,I love the little creature in the last picture.
26043,Whoever told you you can't draw is completely wrong.
26044,You have a real thing for art!
26045,Incredible
26046,Keep going!!
26047,You have talent and if it makes you happy keep at it.
26048,You have a true eye for art and a gift at capturing beauty.
26049,I believe in your abilities and want you to keep drawing.
26050,I love the use of shading and the feelings you  express.
26051,-Mom
26052,Your understanding of shading is phenomenal
26053,You're very talented.
26054,Don't let anyone tell you otherwise ❤
26055,Anyone can draw.
26056,YOU are an artist with talent.
26057,There's a big difference.
26058,"Also, you have a wonderful therapist and I'd stick with them."
26059,Believe in yourself and we all believe in you!
26060,!
26061,"Birth person aside.. Bleck btw

WOW YOU ARE SO TALENTED MY LITTLE DUCKLING

yes I meant to yell because I love the artist in you."
26062,It only has to speak to you to be great.
26063,🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
26064,You're really good at the thing you can't do.
26065,Oh WOW she was wrong!
26066,Or blind lol.
26067,"You have a natural talent, you should treat yourself to a nice sketchbook to mark this milestone!"
26068,Buy a nice frame and hang one on the wall to remind yourself of all the growth and possibility that can come with unlearning birthgivers lies!
26069,Most of all keep up the good work ♡
26070,I LOVE THEM.
26071,Your talent shines through.
26072,Please keep creating and showing the world what you can do.
26073,Be proud of yourself for your accomplishment and progress!
26074,11/10 would look again
26075,So much talent!
26076,Proud of you baby!
26077,"That's so beautiful, may I use that as my wallpaper on my phone?"
26078,These are beautiful and have depth
26079,(especially 2 and 4!!)
26080,You have a real talent!
26081,I’m amazed you drew that portrait after only a year of working on your skills.
26082,Keep going!
26083,!
26084,That's such a wise takeaway.
26085,I need to remember to get my emotions out more in the same way.
26086,Thanks for the reminder.
26087,Amazing!!!
26088,"She was just jealous, but you are an artist and do not let anyone tell you otherwise!!!"
26089,!
26090,You certainly have the talent.
26091,"If you want to improve: practice, take some lessons, and copy the masters and practice some more."
26092,Art is more about having fun and doing what you love.
26093,The last one..
26094,I just want to hug it 🥺
26095,You’re SO good!
26096,I love the last one
26097,"I never felt so much strong feelings for some drawings, incredible!"
26098,Wonderful!
26099,I’m an art therapist and I love to draw as well.
26100,It’s very grounding and meditating.
26101,My birth mother (rip) often laughed at my attempts even tho she was an artist herself.
26102,Some people like the power they feel when putting others down.
26103,Especially if they feel the person “needs” the encouragement.
26104,"Thank you, granny!"
26105,Thank you!
26106,"Oh gosh, so many things that I shouldn't/don't believe anymore."
26107,We haven't spoken in years and breaking that tie was the best decision of my life.
26108,Therapy is really hard but rewarding.
26109,:)
26110,Thank you!
26111,Thank you!
26112,💙
26113,Thanks!
26114,Thank you.
26115,💙 I have a dissociative disorder and that is what it feels like when I dissociate.
26116,That is my therapists office that you can see really small in the clear part of the drawing.
26117,"Underwater, far away, and noisy is how it feels for me when I dissociate."
26118,"Thanks, I will."
26119,💙
26120,Thank you!
26121,Possibly both.
26122,We'll never know now because she's not allowed to be a part of my life anymore.
26123,Thank you!
26124,"Thanks :)

Yes, most of my stuff is actually abstract."
26125,I've always had a hard time expressing emotion because we didn't learn that skill as a kid.
26126,Discovering that I could express emotion using charcoal was a huge deal.
26127,I'm amazed how often just getting my emotions out of my head and on to paper can help me process what I'm feeling and then move past it rather than just getting caught in the same bed mental loop.
26128,You should give a whirl again.
26129,:)
26130,Yes you should try again.
26131,I kinda put up stuff for while too but I still have sketchbooks and other things I have done.
26132,I treated myself to some good watercolor paper and some brushes etc just to play with.
26133,I also love charcoal or pencils that have the different grades of shade and darkness.
26134,Me too
26135,Thank you :)
26136,"Thanks, sib."
26137,:)
26138,Thank you!
26139,Thank you!
26140,"Thank you, I will."
26141,:)
26142,"Thanks, mom."
26143,💙
26144,"Yeah, most of my stuff is actually abstract just to get my emotions out of my head and onto paper."
26145,Thank you :)
26146,Thanks :) I haven't been on speaking terms with birth person in years and that was the best decision I ever made in my life.
26147,"Oh gosh, I started with my therapist because she specializes in dissociative disorders thinking the art therapy stuff wasn't going to apply to me."
26148,Glad she does art therapy because who knows when I would have tried this out otherwise.
26149,Thank you!
26150,Agreed.
26151,Thank you!
26152,Thanks :)
26153,Thank you!
26154,💙
26155,Thanks!
26156,"Oh my gosh, that is literally #2."
26157,I have a dissociative disorder and that's how it feels for me when I dissociate when I'm in therapy.
26158,Thank you!
26159,Thank you!
26160,💙
26161,Thank you :)
26162,Thank you!
26163,"Aww, thanks!"
26164,Thank you!
26165,Thank you!
26166,Thank you!
26167,Thank you!
26168,Thanks
26169,Thanks!
26170,Thank you.
26171,Thanks.
26172,Thank you!
26173,"Yeah, he was pretty great."
26174,:) I'm taking an oil painting class from him right now and we'll just say that charcoal drawing is clearly more my thing.
26175,Lol.
26176,I can't mix colors to save my life.
26177,Love charcoal though so I'm not upset about it.
26178,Maybe?
26179,Most of my other stuff is on the abstract side and feels a lot more personal and scary for sharing just because it's all emotion around trauma.
26180,Thank you.
26181,💙
26182,Thank you!
26183,💙
26184,"Not at all, that warms my heart to know someone likes it that much."
26185,💙
26186,I don't.
26187,I wouldn't even know where to start on trying to do that.
26188,Thank you!
26189,💙
26190,I actually have no idea who she is.
26191,Lol.
26192,We used a picture in the charcoal drawing class as a prompt so she's a stranger to me.
26193,I don't mind if you print it out.
26194,Amen to that.
26195,Once you have monetized something it stops being a hobby.
26196,Thank you!
26197,Thanks
26198,Thank you!
26199,Great therapist for suggesting it but YOU gave her a listen and a try.
26200,Kudos to you
26201,I wondered what the center of the pic was.
26202,"I could see a bookcase and someone slumped over in a chair with what might be a refrigerator, lol."
26203,I like that one alot.
26204,I was literally so drawn to that picture because it spoke to me as someone with a dissociative disorder (derealization).
26205,Seeing this comment makes so much sense!
26206,"Not only is your art good as far as lines and appearances, but it definitely invokes the feelings that you're intending to portray."
26207,I love the third one!
26208,Let us know if you ever start selling these!
26209,Sound like a narcissist.
26210,And afraid that you might be more talented or successful than her.
26211,I'm pleased to hear it.
26212,It doesn't matter.
26213,You just have to unlearn some of the damage that she has passed on to you.
26214,I can totally see that.
26215,Sometimes you start on one thing and then realize throughout the process that you are showing something else.
26216,After writing that.
26217,I began watching how to draw on your computer.
26218,"I am more discouraged than anything, but hey, I have a plane book, I could start with that."
26219,"All of the tutorials were about drawing people, and honestly, I never tried."
26220,Agreed.
26221,Art is such a release and you can draw/paint any damn thing you want to.
26222,I have always been appreciative that my inlaws were just not interested in Hubs or our family.
26223,They wanted to trot us out like show ponies when it benefited their image at church and ignore us the rest of the time.
26224,"Also, Hubs was the scapegoat."
26225,"So if I didn't mention contacting FIL, Hubs wasn't going to contact him."
26226,We were happier when I didn't mention it.
26227,Keep trying it out.
26228,It doesn't matter if it is a masterpiece but it's deffinatly a good way to express yourself.
26229,Having someone there to teach values and highlights in painting is a great thing.
26230,I used to love Bob Ross immensely.
26231,I did okay but the tips my teacher gave me about adding in a color that I just wouldn't have thought of made my paintings so much better.
26232,"Nothing wrong with black, whites and Grey either."
26233,"I understand, no problem."
26234,You *can* draw and thanks for sharing.
26235,That makes it even more amazing.
26236,You were able to bring so much life to her.
26237,Please keep drawing.
26238,You’re so talented and creative.
26239,Some therapist are actually useful.
26240,I had to do some for court and it felt like punishment rather than something to help me.
26241,A couple have truly been helpful and more so when they encourage you.
26242,"And yes, you did this for yourself."
26243,I think what you're seeing as possibly a refrigerator are the windows in her office.
26244,Running theory by myself and some siblings is a bad case of Borderline Personality Disorder.
26245,"There's nothing wrong with mental illness, but not getting help is the real problem."
26246,Total black and white on everything and a constant shifting of what she thinks is truth and reality.
26247,Mostly now I pity her.
26248,Deep down I'm sure she understands how abusive she was to all of us and she has to live with that knowledge and the pain of slowly losing all of her family as we one by one cut contact.
26249,I can never remember her being genuinely happy.
26250,"I may have a bunch of shit left to work through thanks to her, but at least I don't have to carry the burdens that she does."
26251,"What a horrible, miserable life she has and she has only herself to blame for that."
26252,Yes!!!
26253,I was thinking the same thing.
26254,I found a class at a local art place.
26255,The price wasn't too bad and it was amazing having somewhere there that could I could watch in real time and get advice when things weren't working the way that I expected.
26256,People are hard to draw.
26257,Start with some basic shapes and shading again maybe.
26258,Possibly but I did like to look in there and see what was in the center.
26259,I like that one alot.
26260,"And some might say..""But that's your mother.""."
26261,How you and your siblings were treated.
26262,That's not a family.
26263,"At least you have some peace now, and less stress."
26264,Oh...
26265,I am not there yet... but it's not a bad idea.
26266,"My plane book is too complex, but I just recalled that I bought drawing book lessons for my kid so they wouldn't have those problems."
26267,I'll start with that!
26268,"My art teacher was my favorite teacher,  no surprise there."
26269,She actually gave me a little pin/award that said I was learning techniques and using them in my art.
26270,Apparently other teachers were surprised at this since I was doing basic work in some of their classes.
26271,Keep us updated on how it goes.
26272,:)
26273,Good idea and learning together could be a great experience.
26274,"Not only did she speak, she indicated a want or need!"
26275,You tried to hand her to your mom and she said “No”.
26276,Indicating that she wanted you to carry her!
26277,I am so proud of her!
26278,"That's so amazing, just keep it up and she'll be chatting you up in no time!"
26279,"This is so wholesome, I do hope she feels better though!"
26280,I keep running across your posts on your cousin and I am so so happy to see this one!
26281,What a wonderful development!
26282,You and your parents are just absolute angels and I hope that sweet girl flourishes in your home.
26283,<3
26284,Amazing!
26285,"Just a little tip from a toddler mom- don't make a big deal of anything she says, it could make her self conscious and stop speaking again :)"
26286,Yay!
26287,I remember your other post.
26288,So excited for you all 💖
26289,Oh sweetheart that is awesome.
26290,The kindness and love you have shown her has made he so comfortable and safe that she can start to relax and feel safe.
26291,Well done family and well done you.
26292,I read your other post about your older sister and I have to say YOU are amazing and your kindness shines through.
26293,May Ellie and your little sister continue to show you more of who they are.
26294,I think it is almost time Ellie the elephant got her own sister toy to hang out with just like her human has.
26295,I hope she gets well soon!
26296,"I've seen your & your mom's posts, and I'm cheering for your family."
26297,Give our regards to Ellie.
26298,OMG this is way too wholesome.
26299,"You're her safe person, I'm so glad she has you."
26300,"Take my silver, sorry it's not 🥇"
26301,"As someone who has worked as a special needs aide, this made me so happy for your cousin and ridiculously proud of you and your family for being so loving, patient and caring."
26302,Tell Ellie that we're proud of her for taking such good care of your cousin.
26303,And your cousin for being brave at the hospital.
26304,💕😭
26305,I have a cousin that didn’t speak til he was about 12.
26306,His parents were obviously very concerned and took him to many doctors but they could never figure it out.
26307,Then one day he just started talking and said he just didn’t want to speak before!
26308,He’s in his early 20s now and doing great!
26309,!
26310,"I said it in your other post, and I'll say it again here, keep being awesome."
26311,You are a fantastic person and that little girl is lucky to have a safe space with you.
26312,Omg this is so wonderful.
26313,She's starting to feel safe and comfortable with you all.
26314,Wait I remember you!
26315,Don’t you have an entitled sister?
26316,I’m so happy she’s starting to open up!
26317,You seem like an amazing big sister to her and I for one am super proud of her and so happy for you and your mom and dad.
26318,This is wonderful!
26319,Congratulations!!
26320,You all are loving people!
26321,!
26322,"Oh, my heart."
26323,I am really rooting for you all.
26324,Please keep these updates coming as you breakthrough to her by just being you.
26325,You and your family are fantastic.
26326,My oldest is autistic.
26327,"After years of silence, hearing his voice for the first time was one the most amazing experiences of my life (then and even now)."
26328,I’m so glad she has you and that you got to hear this.
26329,Oh this made me tear up!!
26330,This is such a wonderful step for her and it’s obvious she feels very safe with you.
26331,"Whatever you’re doing, you’re doing the right thing!"
26332,!
26333,How wonderful!!
26334,"As a mom of twins on the spectrum, I know how huge this is!!"
26335,"She is so blessed to have you and your parents, and you are blessed to have her!"
26336,Love to you all!!
26337,❤️
26338,Omg she loves you.
26339,"She feels that you're for real in her life,  a comforting constant."
26340,I'm tearing up reading this.
26341,A new step into the future for your family.
26342,🥰
26343,Aw that’s awesome
26344,This is wonderful!
26345,I'm so pleased for you all.
26346,This is so beautiful!
26347,That’s amazing.
26348,She’s so lucky to have you.
26349,I can feel the pride and love through just your words.
26350,I wasn’t going to cry today … you made me cry … ooo sweet girl!!
26351,You’re such an amazing sister!
26352,!
26353,Yay Rachel!
26354,❤️❤️😆
26355,Oh that's wonderful love!
26356,"I have to admit, I've been kind of following your family's story and while I'm sorry for all the upheaval, this is SUCH a huge sign that you've all done exactly the right thing and made the right stand!!!"
26357,"This little girl needs y'all's love and support and I'm so, so, SO glad she's learning to trust y'all."
26358,I love this.
26359,Keep giving that girl love - it's clearly making a difference.
26360,You’ve posted elsewhere about her & your situation.
26361,She seems to have bonded with you.
26362,Isn’t it great?
26363,Glad she’s talking & she loves & trusts you.
26364,I saw your AITA post and I’m so happy she is adjusting well.
26365,Your family is in my thoughts and I hope your sister comes around and stops being such a jerk.
26366,It just goes to show you what a big dose of love can and will do!
26367,💗💗💗
26368,Oh my heart.
26369,She’s in the right place!
26370,I’m an internet stranger but I just started crying.
26371,This is beautiful.
26372,"Aww every one needs comforting when we don't feel good, little ones especially."
26373,I'm glad you took the time to acknowledge this special moment.
26374,I hope Pandora's boxed has been opened and soon you have a regular chatterbox!
26375,This is great!
26376,!
26377,I know how awesome that is.
26378,My son didn’t speak until he was 7.
26379,Central auditory processing.
26380,I hope she’s feeling better!
26381,This is amazing!
26382,Thats awesome!
26383,"As a side note I thought your title said "" my baby sitter just spoke for the first time"" lol 😆"
26384,This has to be my favorite post so far.
26385,Good for you and your family to love her that way.
26386,"My parents adopted my little brother when he was 2, he's biologically my cousin too."
26387,Here and I are super close today.
26388,He's now 49.
26389,She's lucky to have you and Ellie!
26390,I've never heard of this sub and this story warmed my heart so much.
26391,Thank you.
26392,"Congrats on the progress and moreover, kudos on the treatment by you and yours of your newfound sister!"
26393,It sounds like your all doing a great job helping her overcome whatever trauma caused the silence.
26394,It makes me so happy that this little girl has a big sister cheering for her!
26395,I'm so very happy to hear this update.
26396,"Take care of her, and remember...you're doing an awesome job."
26397,One that means the world to her
26398,I think it might be dusty in here.
26399,My eyes are leaking.
26400,That’s an amazing development!
26401,I’m really happy for all of you.
26402,❤️
26403,"This is so lovely to hear 🥰 I have non verbal 8 year old twins (they get their points across regardless though with photo cards and AAC), one of them has recently started saying “go!” when she wants us go get her something."
26404,"It’s so nice to hear her voice :)

She sounds like an awesome kid, and you’re an awesome cousin/sibling 🥰"
26405,"I am so happy that she has your family to not just take care of her, but to love her fully!"
26406,Tears in my eyes!
26407,Wishing you all the best of everything!
26408,I instantly remembered your post from AITA and from what I remember this is massive.
26409,I’m so excited for you and proud of her.
26410,She is so strong and overcoming so much and you and your family are providing her with a safe space for that.
26411,What an amazing milestone.
26412,This made my heart so happy.
26413,She loves you
26414,this is amazing.
26415,you're doing such a good job.
26416,Keep doing what you're doing.
26417,It's working.
26418,You are a great sister.
26419,She feels safe and accepted by you.
26420,Good job.
26421,NTA!
26422,What a jerk!
26423,Your sister has a wonderful elephant friend in Ellie if her Ellie is anything like my son's Ellie.
26424,"Wow, that's awesome!"
26425,"It's good to hear she's better now, you are so good for her."
26426,It's a bless she ended up with you.
26427,How awesome.
26428,She is finally feeling safe and secure.
26429,She recognizes that you and your mom are safe people.
26430,You guys are doing a great job.
26431,I hope that other situation with other your sister gets resolved.
26432,I know you guys love her too.
26433,I was in foster care.
26434,I find children like this will talk more the more comfortable they get around you.
26435,You’ll thank god for the day they get angry at you or have a tantrum because it will show you they not only feel comfortable enough around you to talk but safe around you enough to feel their emotions fully.
26436,Thank you for being a safe place for a little girl who clearly needed 1!!!!
26437,!
26438,"I was 3 when I first spoke, even though my parents were very patient with me and gave me time I actually would speak to myself but was embarrassed to speak in front of other people I guess that's why it took me so long personally."
26439,It is always so amazing when you hear their voice!
26440,"My son's neurologist says that if you see improvement when they are sick (sometimes called ""the fever effect"") that it warrants trying Sulforaphane, which is a supplement made from broccoli."
26441,"OP, I saw your parents post and then your post."
26442,This has warmed my heart and made me cry.
26443,You’re an amazing big sibling.
26444,"So much love to your family, keep going strong little sis"
26445,Hey!
26446,Are you the one with the AH sister who disowned your family?
26447,"If so, I'm so glad to see that your little sister actually said something to you guys :) thats a big step!"
26448,What a strong girl!
26449,We love that for you
26450,"OP, your little sister is soooooooo blessed to have a good older sibling like you!!!!"
26451,You are healing her little heart and her brain with your love!
26452,That’s why she felt so safe with you and wanted to stay with you.
26453,You are her safe person.
26454,You are a good good good person.
26455,I’m crying happy/sad tears for her and for you.
26456,I can’t imagine what horrors she has been through to become so scared of speaking—but I’m so happy she is finally in the hands of good family who treats her better!
26457,😭😭😭😭
26458,I also saw your other post and had your little sister and her elephant on my mind since then.
26459,You and your parents are doing amazing helping this child with her trauma.
26460,Thank you for sharing this breakthrough with us.
26461,Sending you all much love 😽💕
26462,Aww so precious you are the chosen one loved above all others.
26463,"I'm sorry for whatever situation has created the situation but yiu were right she IS your sister, your chosen sister."
26464,Letting her know that may help  I say it aa someone who is adopted & have 3 other family members who were adopted in.
26465,I hope her speech has been delayed & that the floodgates now open.
26466,Even a few words are precious & each a treasure.
26467,This is amazing!
26468,And i’m so glad she is doing better.
26469,So proud of your little sister!
26470,And also you’re an awesome person/sibling for helping and caring for her so much.
26471,"As someone who is adopted, thank you and your family for being good humans to someone in need."
26472,Wowwwwww go baby sister-cuz!
26473,Wow.
26474,Amazing.
26475,I have no words other than that.
26476,Just...amazing.
26477,My kid is 21 and has never said a word.
26478,A bad seizure when he was young stole any chance we ever had of that.
26479,Be glad you got even a word.
26480,"And she said her elephant’s name, meaning she wanted her elephant."
26481,She’s in good hands.
26482,She’ll be okay.
26483,"Edit: I’m about to go to the hospital and see my sister (it’s one visitor at a time so once we got my sister situated I had to go, so now I’m going to relieve my mom)."
26484,I’ll update y’all soon.
26485,I just kissed her head and told her I’m proud of her.
26486,Ellie has plenty of brothers and sisters (I’m working on learning their names) but my sister only carries Ellie around.
26487,Everyone else stays in her room.
26488,"Possibly apocryphal story, Albert Einstein apparently didn't speak until he was 4 and his first words were something along the lines of ""this soup is cold"", when queried as to why he'd never spoken before he commented that ""up to this point everything was satisfactory"" ;)"
26489,"Yes, I do."
26490,I’m with her right now.
26491,She already looks better and she has enough energy to play with the toys I bought her.
26492,Hopefully she’ll feel well enough on Saturday (and be out of the hospital by then) to go look at some houses with our parents.
26493,There’s one that she’s really excited to see.
26494,Ellie does most of the hard work.
26495,I’m just here for the cuddles.
26496,Did you click the wrong post?
26497,I felt so bad this morning.
26498,She cried when I left this morning (our mom was already there so I could go home and eat/rest)
26499,"It is so lovely to see that the first time you were fully aware of her communicating to other humans it was to state a negative, a no, and it was respected and she was cared for in the way she made clear that she wanted."
26500,Being able to stop other people and have them actually respect that is huge.
26501,So huge.
26502,"Children are so frequently ignored when they have reasonable boundaries and wants, even under the best of circumstances."
26503,To think she felt it safe to have an opinion is so heartwarming!
26504,"You must be so very, very proud ❤️"
26505,Absolutely!
26506,What a wonderful milestone for her and your family.
26507,I hope she gets to feeling better soon!
26508,"She wanted you and her elephant it sounds like to me, You're exactly the sibling she needs ❤️"
26509,"Miracles are all around us, and you’re having one with her right now."
26510,"What a fine sister you are, lovey."
26511,You’re a good sibling :’)
26512,"I've worked with many kids with selective mutism (kids who have the physical ability to speak but don't, for whatever reason) and the above poster is correct."
26513,"Do not make a big deal when she speaks, but respond as if she does it all the time."
26514,"When she says ""Ellie"", you should simply respond with something like ""Ellie is a good elephant"" and carry on like nothing odd happened."
26515,"If she points to something, respond with ""you'd like this one?"
26516,""", again, with no surprise."
26517,"With time, she'll hopefully learn to trust you and know that talking is safe and no big deal."
26518,"Good luck with this, honey."
26519,"Trauma is hard, but your love shines through."
26520,You've got this.
26521,Good on you!
26522,Make sure to keep up the positive reinforcement for things like that!
26523,"Even if it’s just grunting and pointing at something she wants, that’s still verbal and should be celebrated"
26524,"If it's something that would make her happy, I've seen r/Photoshoprequests do some really cool things with pictures of stuffed animals (front facing picture with white/solid background is easier)."
26525,I know a lot of kids like seeing their stuffed animals go on adventures!
26526,Yep I remember you too.
26527,"Ditch the older sister and keep this one 🙂 your new sister is a big improvement on your other one

I'm so proud of you for taking such care with your baby sister and keeping her safe."
26528,"My boys struggled with talking, and it's a journey."
26529,There was a time where I would have given 20 years of my life to hear just one full sentence.
26530,I'm so excited for you both.
26531,I'm so proud of you both.
26532,"Keep on loving your baby sister, and watch how she blooms

Sending mum hugs if you want them."
26533,I cried a little with happiness for you both
26534,Don’t feel bad honey.
26535,Remember: You are a mere mortal human being—you cannot be everywhere all at once.
26536,You cannot be there for her 24/7 physically.
26537,You cannot do everything for her.
26538,Don’t you dare feel bad for a minute that you need to take care of yourself.
26539,"Don’t feel bad that you don’t have superhuman powers to be everywhere 24/7 for her, and don’t feel bad that you can’t avoid sleeping, eating, work, school, pooping, visiting your own friends, self care, fine alone, and whatever else you need as a human to exist and be healthy."
26540,"It is important to let yourself have breaks, for mental health and physical health."
26541,It is important to take care of your own life needs too honey.
26542,"Even if you care for her more than your own self, think of it like this: you’re less good for her, if you are tired/stressed/sick/weak/drained/fried by not taking care of yourself."
26543,Although you shouldn’t care for her more than you care for yourself.
26544,You should care for her equally to yourself and love yourself equal to how you love her.
26545,Because you’re both two beautiful human beings made in God’s image worthy equally of love and care.
26546,Don’t view yourself as less worthy of care than her—that can accidentally become a toxic mentality with caregivers.
26547,Over-martyrdom.
26548,"You are also an equal human being who is worth comfort, safety, warm bed, sleep, good food, etc."
26549,You’re just as important to take care of as she is.
26550,Don’t put yourself as less important than her.
26551,You’re both equal humans.
26552,"❤️

So you’re helping 2 beautiful good humans (her and you) by taking care of yourself."
26553,Just explain to her why you cannot stay.
26554,"That you’re only human, and human beings cannot do everything."
26555,That you need to go home and rest and stuff.
26556,And explain that it doesn’t mean you love her any less—it just means your human brain and human body has limits.
26557,YES!
26558,This is so important!
26559,You validated and respected her feelings OP!!!
26560,Great job!
26561,"This is why toddlers love saying “no” to others, they’re learning what it means and that it gives them power."
26562,Thank you.
26563,I asked if she wanted Ellie and she nodded her head so my mom got Ellie out of the bag for her.
26564,Wait.
26565,So making a big deal when a kid speaks and getting excited will make them choose not to speak?why?
26566,Thank you.
26567,I’m back at the hospital.
26568,Sister was crying and asking for me (via whiteboard).
26569,"I'm not crying, you're crying."
26570,Excellent!
26571,!
26572,"Kids experiencing selective mutism are often very anxious about speaking, so if you are making a big deal when they do speak, you are validating that speaking is a BIG DEAL and reinforcing that they SHOULD be anxious about it."
26573,Kids tend to do better when you acknowledge what they said in a neutral yet supportive tone.
26574,You are teaching her that she can trust you to come back!
26575,That’s incredibly important.
26576,"We're both crying, it's okay <3"
26577,Do you think I should tell her that I can hear her late night conversations with Ellie or do you think she’d stop talking to her if she knows I can hear her.
26578,Oh.
26579,Oops
26580,So much this.
26581,I was a selective mute as a child due to trauma and neglect and when people would make a big deal about hearing me speak I would shut down immediately.
26582,I also had a lisp as a child and it compounded the situation.
26583,It helped most when people didn’t make a fuss about it or try to pressure me to speak.
26584,"Now as an adult I have no issues speaking, lisp is gone."
26585,"Therapy helped a lot and I have been able, as an adult, to have now healthy conversations and communication and with that a successful career."
26586,"She has separation anxiety and it can make it hard to leave, especially if she’s not home."
26587,I wouldn't mention it.
26588,Let her practice when it's safe (alone) and let her come to you when she's ready.
26589,Don't tell her.
26590,Speaking from personal experience on this one.
26591,"Let that private, personal time that's just for her be just that."
26592,"no, those are private conversations just for ellie's ears."
26593,elephant ears hold lots of secrets.
26594,"Can you get your own elephant and you talk to your elephant, read books to your elephant, and have your elephant talk to Ellie?"
26595,"All very low key, and not a big deal at all if her elephant decides to talk to yours."
26596,A tea party might also be nice - kids used to do that before cell phones and computers took over.
26597,"If you sew, you can make clothing for Ellie."
26598,"""Ellie, would you like a red shirt or green shirt?"""
26599,No oops.
26600,This stuff is hard.
26601,We learn as we go.
26602,"This is very different from when babies and toddlers learn to speak to begin with, mind you."
26603,So feel free to be very excited when babies and toddlers babble and talk :)
26604,I am so proud of you!!!
26605,Trauma and anxiety often underlie selective mutism.
26606,"I'm sorry things were hard for you, but I'm so glad things are better now."
26607,This mom/teacher thinks you're awesome!
26608,Yeah I can understand that.
26609,But by you consistently keeping the promise to come back she will learn to trust you.
26610,"Maybe, after Reachel will feel good again and will be home you should go to see het terapist with her."
26611,"Because I understand that you are her safe person, but she needs to learn that you can not be with her 100% of time and that she has other people that she can coun’t on."
26612,Because you said that she is usualy sitting next to you or in your lap and that and maybe she is getting too atacht to you.
26613,"(I don't mean ot in bad way, but this can be big problem in future, when you go to school, work ect."
26614,and  then it is going to be bad for her) I just want to say that she should have a healty bond with you and not overly fixation on you.
26615,"( I am also not a psychologist so maybe i am wrong, ) 

I hope she will be okey, my heart is with her and your family ."
26616,❤️ and please keep us updated I can't stop thinking about Rachel and Ellie
26617,I agree.
26618,"Not because it has to be a secret that it can be heard, but because this is another way to show respect for another person."
26619,"There are plenty of times where we are experiencing something, but do not want to talk about it, or want to love on from it."
26620,"Other people can ask ""everything okay?"
26621,"You seem upset"", but you just say it's fine, nothing special."
26622,"As long as it isn't passive aggressive or you're clammed up but actually want to talk about it, then letting someone else move past whatever it was is a sign of respect."
26623,"Letting them not pull whatever it was with them for the rest of the day, but leave it behind so to speak."
26624,"If you get the sense she would be genuinely upset that you can hear it, then maybe let her know that you can hear her talk to her Ellie."
26625,"I would lie about being able to understand it (if I did) since it was obviously not meant for my ears, though."
26626,"If it is a way to keep tabs of her in a way you otherwise won't be able to, but need to, then don't say anything at all."
26627,Adults keep tabs on kids without letting on all the time.
26628,"Then we adjust our lives in small ways here and there based on everything we know, day to day."
26629,Same goes for telling family members about their own kids if you've had them over.
26630,Particularly if it's something they would maybe like to be made aware of.
26631,"Be it something troublesome, or something awesome :)"
26632,"Ok well, Ellie told me a couple secrets like she and my sister sometimes stay up past bedtime and eat skittles and drink kool aid."
26633,I don’t sew but I think my mom might have fun with the outfits for Ellie.
26634,And I can get myself a stuffed animal to talk to/play with Ellie.
26635,Well...I've got a 5 year old in speech who talks a lot now.
26636,A 3 1/2 year old who barely talks.
26637,He just started finally deciding to say mama.
26638,He can make a lot of the other sounds.
26639,He just refuses to try to talk.
26640,To try to tell me what he wants.
26641,"When he said mama a bit ago, I responded all excited and encourage him to talk."
26642,He didn't.
26643,He had fun with my response.
26644,But he did not speak and he didn't say it again for a little while.
26645,I think my kids are brats.
26646,Lol.
26647,I try to get them to talk and talk to them.
26648,They didn't wanna.
26649,My 3 1/2 year old would rather yell and scream.
26650,I'm hoping my baby won't be an issue getting to talk.
26651,I appreciate the kind words!
26652,It was a long time ago and I hope things get better for OPs sister as well as it will take time and therapy will help.
26653,I now have a son of my own and have fought hard to get past all my trauma to build a great life and home for him as well as I never wanted him to have to go through any of what I dealt with at a young age.
26654,We’re working on it.
26655,"Since she got her new room, she’s been more comfortable playing in her room while I work as long as I come in and check on her every now and then."
26656,"In the afternoons when my mom is home, she either follows our mom or sits in my lap."
26657,The only time she’s really upset when I’m not there is bedtime because she likes a lot of hugs and kisses and cuddles and our mom isn’t very cuddly.
26658,GASP!
26659,Scandal!
26660,!
26661,"OP, I am so friggin excited by her words!!"
26662,"Made me tear up (cutting onions, ofc)."
26663,I used to work with differently abled kids by choice in school (got credit and graded for classroom work with the kids).
26664,"I know how I felt wishing my mute kids would speak some day, so this is like winning the frigging lottery!!"
26665,"This means she trusts you guys, which is amazing!"
26666,"Keep on supporting her as you have been, I bet more words will follow."
26667,"BTW,  read your other post about your sister."
26668,She is a total ass.
26669,"Please do update both stories, will come back to check both."
26670,11 is also an age where she can operate a sewing machine or learn to hand sew or knit.
26671,"If you have an Ikea near you, they have little wooden beds in the kids section, play food, and **so many stufties**."
26672,"Though she might not be into going to IKEA if crowds are an issue, I assume crowds would enhance anxiety."
26673,I would put a pair of old-fashioned toy telephones on the shopping list as well.
26674,"And a play grocery store, and some menus for the tea party."
26675,"(My kids had a lot of toys, lol) 

I am not sure what her diagnosis is, this site is interesting if you haven't seen it already: https://www.selectivemutism.org/how-to-help-child-with-selective-mutism/

Also, you might consider placing an Apple Airtag inside Ellie."
26676,And an note/phone number inside her outfits.
26677,"""very important elephant""  A back-up elephant is in order as well, if you can find an identical one."
26678,There is a sub -reddit for this somewhere.
26679,"Rachel has been through so much already, you don't want her to have to deal with loss of a stuftie."
26680,I am so glad she has a safe and loving family now!
26681,I love that idea
26682,you need professional help with this.
26683,Can you get your 3.5 yo in speech too?
26684,Often language delay has a genetic component.
26685,"They aren’t bring brats, they are struggling to communicate it sounds like."
26686,My now 5 year old was the same way.
26687,He had a couple words he would say here and there but preferred gestures mostly.
26688,There were a lot of screaming and tantrums.
26689,He started speech therapy at 4 which is also when he finally started talking more.
26690,Now at 5 he barely stops talking.
26691,"He is hard to understand for a lot of people and while he does speak in sentences, they aren't as close to normal grammar as the other kids his age."
26692,There is definitely hope for your little guy.
26693,"I think in this case (from reading OP’s other post) her sister/cousin is refusing to speak because she’s been traumatized by a specific past event or events, which is a delicate situation."
26694,"Her talking will only happen if she’s very comfortable in her surroundings and people, and getting excited will remove any relaxed feelings she had that allowed her to speak in the first place."
26695,Yours (unless they’ve witnessed something traumatizing) sound like it is likely due to their temperament or a physical or neurological reason.
26696,"Many kids with mild autism (mild autism is not a good name, you either have it or you don’t, but I mean autism where they don’t need much help like what used to be called Asperger’s), speech impediments or hearing complications start talking late."
26697,My SIL’s child had problems with his Eustachian tubes in his ears not draining and he could hear but it was muffled.
26698,"He didn’t start talking until he had tubes put in that kept them open, and now he speaks and hears normally."
26699,If it’s temperament it might be something like ODD or a personality disorder that makes them defiant or unable to stay calm enough to talk instead of scream.
26700,"In all these cases the reason isn’t life threatening but it can be serious or set them back if it’s not followed up or treated, so it’s good that you’re getting it looked into."
26701,Someone should warn Ellie that not brushing your teeth after eating that stuff can cause cavities
26702,Remind me!
26703,2 weeks
26704,Yeah.
26705,I know.
26706,I called the government help program for youths.
26707,Intermediate unit.
26708,I'm waiting for paperwork to come in the mail for me to fill out and an permission to evaluate email.
26709,He's gonna have a full workup.
26710,He's gonna be evaluated some time this August.
26711,"Fortunately if he's behind in any other areas, they'll be able to tell me where and hopefully more resources will open up to get him caught up where he should be."
26712,Thank you for responding.
26713,I really do appreciate the advice.
26714,"Not everyone would know to get them help because of the stories I've heard that people told me ""he's fine."
26715,"Mine didn't start talking until he was 4 and now he won't shut up"" the earlier you can get kids help, the better."
26716,Yeah.
26717,"When he gets evaluated, then he'll get speech through the state."
26718,"And I didn't mean ""brat"" in the negative sense."
26719,Just more like a stinker kind of way.
26720,"Like ""you want me to talk?"
26721,You want me to say mama?
26722,"Nope""."
26723,Like when you encourage a kid to do something and they just stare at you with a smile.
26724,"You know they're well aware of what you want them to do, but will they do it?"
26725,Nope.
26726,And the yelling and screaming.
26727,It's not all out of anger.
26728,He yells and screams when he's excited.
26729,"He'll say ""oooooh"" a lot."
26730,He's tried saying a few things but he doesn't keep trying to and stops when you try to encourage him to talk with a big smile on his face.
26731,Autistic kids sometimes have a lifelong struggle with dental hygiene because it's invasive and sensory hell.
26732,"If your sister hates it, she may do better with a smaller, softer brush and either kid flavors, or Tom's toothpaste from whole foods."
26733,I think TJ's has non mint toothpaste too.
26734,It's the intense mint that's just too much for a lot of people.
26735,To me it's like the pain of hot sauce.
26736,Vanilla or ginger is a little easier.
26737,"Well, my own father was apparently very late and didn't start talking until he could speak almost perfect."
26738,At four.
26739,"Mind you, he was raised in an affluent family and likely babbled and talked a lot with nannies... My head canon is that my grandparents didn't care to notice before that."
26740,"Because nobody starts speaking fluently as late as four, but didn't really say much at all until then unless there are issues."
26741,So he's sassy in a fun way?
26742,"Or mostly fun, anyways?"
26743,That's a trait that will likely help them cope with life better than if they aren't.
26744,"Best wishes, another sassy person 😂"
26745,From an SLP-not being able to repeat things on demand can be a sign of childhood apraxia of speech.
26746,She doesn’t hate it.
26747,She just has a habit of eating skittles after bedtime and I don’t think she brushed after.
26748,"She’s not autistic though, her not speaking is due to trauma."
26749,Autistic kids can do that.
26750,Not talk at all and suddenly start putting words together.
26751,But you're also right that stories get mistold over decades.
26752,"like, the same would be said about op's sister if no one noticed she has been in conversation with her stuffed companion."
26753,Kinda.
26754,Sometimes in a fun way.
26755,In others the 3 year old attitude way.
26756,I'm hoping to get more answers than just with his speech though.
26757,He does what he wants when he wants regardless of how or how many times I correct him.
26758,"I've smacked his butt (he still wears a pullup), tapped him on the mouth for screaming, sent him to bed."
26759,Taken things away.
26760,Repeatedly told him every time why he was in trouble and what he did.
26761,"""We don't scream."
26762,Inside voice.
26763,"Quiet""

I haven't had this much trouble with my 5 year old at all."
26764,I'm at a loss right now.
26765,He would walk off/run towards the road constantly but fortunately he's quit that for the most part.
26766,"While he ignores and does what he wants, I don't think he's ""stupid"" so to speak."
26767,"And I don't want to use that word, I just am not sure how else to phrase it."
26768,"If you take your eyes off him for a minute, he can disappear and roam around the surrounding area as if he doesn't understand there's a problem and that he's in trouble for doing so."
26769,Hes been in trouble for that kind of thing numerous times.
26770,I can't tell if he's just not getting it or he is and he doesn't care.
26771,If he's too smart for his own good.
26772,"The kinds of things he likes to watch are educational like number blocks, letter and word shows, cocomelon sometimes, and the magic schoolbus, storybots."
26773,As a baby he constantly took in his surroundings.
26774,Very low maintenence.
26775,Didn't have to be constantly entertained.
26776,Never had trouble teaching him to go to bed and fall asleep on his own.
26777,He's very observant.
26778,"With how many times he's watched shows about numbers, letters and words."
26779,It wouldn't surprise me if he knew how to count from 1-20 at least.
26780,"He's gotten excited when I've written his name and said each letter, making me think he's smarter than what he's willing to show."
26781,He's constantly going.
26782,I can't get him to sit down and pay attention for a project or listen.
26783,I set stuff up around him and he immediately wants to play in it.
26784,Like I was trying to plant a flower bulb with him as a fun little project that could be his flower.
26785,He was only interested in playing in the dirt and water.
26786,"When we take him in the pool at my parents, we put floaties on before he walks out of their house."
26787,He has no fear of the water.
26788,He'll jump in.
26789,He doesn't seem to jump whenever there isn't someone standing there going to catch him but I wouldn't rely on that of course from a 3 year old.
26790,I don't know if this stuff is just a phase or what.
26791,So I'm hoping to get some answers about how to handle him when he gets evaluated.
26792,Whata that if you don't mind my asking?
26793,"A phase is something that comes and goes, this seems more permanent."
26794,Could very likely be that he is on the autism spectrum.
26795,"It's not just a flat slider from nothing to a lot, but... A spectrum :p Like the full colour spectrum."
26796,All sorts of different behaviours may or may not be present.
26797,"Smiling when you say things could be as basic as ""I knew that would happen!"
26798,I get the pattern here!
26799,It happened again!
26800,"I'm understanding cause and effect!!"""
26801,and have nothing to do with spite.
26802,"Toddlers are very often in a world that makes no sense, and so seeing they can affect the world and have it respond in predictable ways, and they can predict those ways is a common reason for smiling."
26803,"Like kids seeing that every time they touch the stereo, parent says ""no""."
26804,"Kid predicts it, tries touching the stereo (or whatever), parent says ""no"", kid is happy they got it right and will repeat it many times over."
26805,"That isn't spite, that is a sign of healthy cognitive development."
26806,This is likely very familiar from raising the oldest?
26807,"So when you see something is different about this, I believe you."
26808,It is also a human instinct to smile and chuckle when nervous or scared.
26809,I only truly realised when I saw a nature documentary about primates a few years back.
26810,They use smiling as a social de-escalation tool.
26811,It means they are very uncomfortable and would like for the tension to drop.
26812,"They looked exactly like a child or teenager being scolded, and smiling or chuckling while they hold your eyes and look away every so often."
26813,Keeping track of the other one's emotional state.
26814,It just suddenly made sense that we do this too!
26815,"We've taken this social tool much further though, and use it not just a remedy against discomfort, but all the way into showing and enhancing joy."
26816,But apparently we also still have an instinct to do this when uncomfortable.
26817,Could it be he has that type of response?
26818,Because that looks very much like malicious spite if you don't know anything else.
26819,But a child that young will very rarely be that kind of evil.
26820,"My ex is abusive, and the actual, malignant, malicious spiteful joy they exhibit then is actually somewhat similar to nervous, deeply uncomfortable ""smiling"" visually speaking, though context makes all the difference."
26821,I do hope you'll get more answers as soon as he is seen by specialists.
26822,They'll hopefully also know where to point you for more help with his other issues.
26823,You have an older child.
26824,"Do NOT automatically believe anyone that tells you that ""all kids are different"" as if you don't already know that."
26825,"While you can't always make other people understand, you *know* what kids are like."
26826,"And you have the ""power"" of raising an older child and are aware of how they and their peers vary in development already."
26827,Believe yourself when you say something else is going on here.
26828,I believe you.
26829,My oldest had a health issue from before she was a month old that wasn't helped until they were 3-4 years old.
26830,I said so the whole time.
26831,"I have younger siblings, I have nieces and nephews, I have helped raise stepchildren from a young age."
26832,But I was a mother *myself* for the first time and so my worries were dismissed.
26833,"Norway, Europe here so not even a case of lack of money or anything as all healthcare is 100% free for pregnancy related issues, and for kids until the age of 18."
26834,"Here’s the definition for you from asha.org

Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a neurological childhood (pediatric) speech sound disorder in which the precision and consistency of movements underlying speech are impaired in the absence of neuromuscular deficits (e.g."
26835,"abnormal reflexes, abnormal tone)."
26836,Thank you.
26837,"I'm happy to be getting him evaluated because as far as I know, he just doesn't want to."
26838,"But especially if that is the case, then I'll at least be able to get help for him."
26839,Hi.
26840,I work with children with disabilities.
26841,Good job on recognizing that he needs an eval.
26842,"For now, try to let go of the thinking that he doesn't want to or he's doing things on purpose to push your buttons."
26843,It's more that he is doing things like smiling because in that moment he's getting your attention and he enjoys that.
26844,Look up positive behavior techniques.
26845,"It's basically doing the reverse of what a lot of parents do, which is give more attention to negative behaviors."
26846,So you put more of your energy to teaching and reinforcing the behaviors you want.
26847,It's a starting point for now until you are able to work with whatever therapists can best support your son.
26848,You're doing great.
26849,You recognized that kiddo might need some extra help and you got the process started.
26850,It might take some extra work but it is really rewarding once you see their skills increase.
26851,Thank you so much for the support and kind words.
26852,I greatly appreciate your input.
26853,I will try that and hopefully that will work better with him.
26854,I know every child is different so one way works for one but may not work for the other.
26855,I'm looking forward to getting him some help.
26856,My other son's speech therapist texted me and said I can put him into headstart.
26857,I thought kids had to be potty trained for headstart which is why I wasn't going to.
26858,Kids take a lot of work and patience but every sacrifice we make is worth it all.
26859,"Like people say, days are long but the years are short."
26860,Welcome lovely little one!
26861,How are you feeling?

26891,Hope you are well and didn't give  mummy too hard a journey out.
26892,Welcome to the Mom club!
26893,Ya done good little duckling!
26894,"Some advice- you will hear about how crying it out is so dangerous…and it is not a great method, but shaken baby syndrome is worse."
26895,"If you need to there is no shame in changing the diaper, feeding, burping and setting the baby down in their safe space and walking away for a few minutes."
26896,"Drink some water, wash your face, he’ll sit on the floor and cry beside them."
26897,"But when you reach your limit, take a breather and go back cool calm and collected."
26898,Good Moms know their limits.
26899,Learn them now because your limits will be tested from now until eternity… but there’s also so so so much love.
26900,Dancing them to sleep is better than crying them to sleep.
26901,On fussy nights put some music on low and dance baby to sleep.
26902,Music you enjoy will inherently help keep you calm and relaxed.
26903,When you get home make yourself a snack station with water and easy snacks near by.
26904,Meals might be a daunting task some days.
26905,Some nutrition is better than no nutrition.
26906,"Sleep when the baby sleeps is nonsense, but be ok with doing the bare minimum of stuff sometimes."
26907,Wash your hair in the sink if you need to.
26908,Eat off paper plates.
26909,"Whatever makes your life easier to free up more time for rest, do it."
26910,You got this love.
26911,You’re going to do great!
26912,Xo
26913,Absolutely perfect gorgeous little person!!

27293,Aww little one - congratulations strong mama
27294,Thank you!
27295,\*she 😬 thank you!
27296,I absolutely loved this comment.
27297,"To some, a mother suddenly stops being a human being with weaknesses, flaws or feelings."
27298,They have this impossible to reach expectations about how motherhood should be.
27299,"I mean, my bff got nasty criticism for.. Painting her nails (???."
27300,"Op please go at your peace, know your limits and allow yourself to keep being a human <3"
27301,"Thank you so much ❤️ I still can’t believe I managed to do it, I feel so relieved!"
27302,!
27303,Congratulations and best of luck for the birth 😬
27304,Dads are more than welcome!
27305,Our flair is self-edit so feel free to get in there and make your Dad flair proudly!
27306,"Also, totally check out r/dadforaminute too, if you hadn't already!"
27307,They can always use some new awesome DadDucks!
27308,💙🤗
27309,"We’re doing good, thanks for asking."
27310,"Unfortunately it’s not as easy as I thought it would be for the last name, it looks like her dad can claim her as his daughter without me so he can have rights on her and unfortunately he plans on doing so."
27311,He wants her to have both last names or he will fill for it..
27312,Her name is Sophia.
27313,"I’m super tired and today I’m sick so I’m even more exhausted 😅 but I’m trying to survive, she’s doing good, that’s all that matters."
27314,"You aren’t going to get much sleep for a while, so please, sleep whenever baby does, and keep visitors to set hours."
27315,You just take care of you and the adorable squish.
27316,"They may ask if you’d like them to keep the baby in the nursery over night, I’d highly recommend taking them up on the offer."
27317,"You’ll have plenty of long nights to get to better know your baby, and your body could really use the chance to recover."
27318,Congratulations!
27319,She’s a keeper!
27320,No I don’t but I stocked up on a lot of easy foods.
27321,Thank you ❤️
27322,"Oops, sorry about that!"
27323,I've edited my comment to reflect the change :)
27324,"Be kind to yourself and relax, enjoy your babe and your new life!!!!"
27325,Much love❤️❤️❤️
27326,"Don't give in, let him file."
27327,"Also if you bring to light what he has done as a teacher and you his student, he will likely never get rights to her."
27328,What a beautiful name!
27329,You can also lead him to believe that you gave her both last names and not give her his name.
27330,It will at least delay him filing.
27331,"But I doubt he will file, he is just using the threat to get what he wants"
27332,Oh <3 I'm using the term adorable squish from now on
27333,Ok. Make sure you rest and don't overwork yourself.
27334,"Even if I don’t give her his last name, he just has to go to the city hall to claim her and have rights on her, maybe he has done it already.. his last name is just for ego but just by claiming her he gots rights on her.."
27335,Exactly my thought!!
27336,What a lil squishy nugget.
27337,I can smell perfection from here!
27338,"Well then, in that case definitely don't give her his last name!!!"
27339,"And even if he does get some rights to her, it won't last long, if you use what he has done against him."
27340,Beautiful ring sweetie!
27341,Just don't snap your fingers...
27342,What a beautiful ring!
27343,All the best to you and your partner!!
27344,!

27352,Your partner will fall short sometimes.
27353,And so will you .

27483,"Not a mom, more of a sister :) 

I work with fine jewelry so I just have some fyi's about your new beauty!"
27484,"Colored stones although stunning, are not meant to last on rings."
27485,"They are not as strong as diamonds, hence why they are not promoted with most everyday wear rings."
27486,"Don't be surprised if your stones start to lose those sharp facets, crack, or eventually break - it's the natural parts of wearing a colored stone on your hand."
27487,You may have to replace some stones over the long years to keep your piece looking fresh and nice!
27488,You can help this by *trying* not to sleep with it on or not wearing it while working with your hands.
27489,But life is life and rings can always be fixed.
27490,"Enjoy your new ring, I love that citrine on the side!"
27491,Beautiful!
27492,I love the colors:-)
27493,That is spectacular

27592,"We are getting married in september, and i have a big, poofy, blush pink dress."
27593,"it has lots of lace detail, it makes me feel like a princess."
27594,i have a tiara to wear with it.
27595,"I did pick it out, the reason i got it is because i didn't want just any old wedding band, i have a tendancie towards rainbows."
27596,My style is basicly rainbow goth so this was perfect.
27597,"We are getting married at the end of september, i ha e a blush pink wedding dress its big and poofy i got it on sale for £200 when it was origonally £1400 best discount i have ever got."
27598,"the ring came with those colours already originally i got this ring because i am a very rainbow person, but it shows of my lgbtq side as well."
27599,"then i realized that it has red, purple and blue in it."
27600,"red is one of my fave colours, so is purple and blue is my partners fave colour."
27601,"i now i feel even more than ever that it is just meant to be my ring, and he is meant to be my partner."
27602,"i love him so much, he saw the ring before i did in the shop and new that if i saw it i would i have to have it."
27603,"thank you, i really appreciate the advice."
27604,we got insurance with the ring and part of it is that they will check it once a year for any issues if they find an issue they will send it off to be fixed plus they clean it up on site so it will be super sparkly when i get it back after inspection.
27605,"red-garnet,purple-amethyst,blue-topaz,green-peridot,yellow-citrine."
27606,the garnet and amethyst are my fave
27607,Beautifully said.

27612,"Sweetie, that ring is glorious!"
27613,"I love that you’re going to wear blush pink, too."
27614,"I didn’t get married in white, myself, and I’m so glad I wore what I did."
27615,"I can’t say enough good things about wearing a tiara, and I’m delighted that you plan to wear yours."
27616,"There may be hiccups on your wedding day, that does sometimes happen what with logistics and all."
27617,"I encourage you to relax and go with the flow; at the end of that special day, you’ll still be married to the love of your life."

27624,Congrats on your engagement and that unique ring of yours :)
27625,I love it when things come together and the sales aid along your journey and wallet.
27626,Are you going to post your dress on here?
27627,I would love to see it.
27628,I am so happy for you.
27629,As a MfM I have to ask.
27630,"Have you two discussed and agreed upon important things like finances, children, which way the toilet paper rolls, household duties equally split, and so on?"
27631,Will you both work or will one stay at home if kids are a part of your future?
27632,Would the stay at home parent still have equal say in finances and responsibilities as the one who works?
27633,"Surprisingly, a lot of people get married without knowing what their partner thinks of these things."
27634,"Just remember in all situations baby, people tell you who they are."
27635,"When they do, believe them."
27636,I am overjoyed for you!
27637,Can't wait to see photos after the wedding!
27638,💜♥️💙💚💛🧡😘
27639,"I have to put everything on soon, to see what i need altered on my dress."
27640,so when i do ill take pics.
27641,I need to try everything on soon so i know what i need alteres on my dress when i do ill take pics and post here.
27642,we have been together for 10 years so we have the important stuff set in stone.
27643,"we never argue if we have disagreements we are always able to work through them, sometimes we have pretend arguments but that's just our sense of humour."
27644,i posted a pic before of the dress but when i try it on properly with the jewelry i will post another pic plus lots and lots of pics from the day.
27645,I’m looking forward to seeing if you’re comfortable posting!
27646,!
27647,I can't wait to see it all together.
27648,I am overjoyed for you!
27649,"I’m just a Dad, but there is something my father taught me that I passed onto my kids and that is “Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly”."
27650,"In times where you find it hard to make your bed, brush your teeth, or clean the dishes.. doing something about them, not necessarily right or to completion, but at least something is an accomplishment in and of itself."
27651,I’m proud of you.
27652,"Holy shit, you're doing them really fast."
27653,That's amazing!
27654,"I'm not quite sure exactly how old you are, you're younger than me but I'm not sure if I'm more older sister age or Mom age, but that doesn't really matter because either way I am proud of you!"
27655,"Depression is so much more than just being sad, it can feel like your drowning and just trying to survive some days is exhausting."
27656,So the fact that you did the dishes is freaking HUGE.
27657,That is such a big deal.
27658,"I've had days where I really wanted to get out of bed and do a small chore but my depression was too much, and even if I wanted to do something the task seemed impossible, so you not only thought of the dishes but you got yourself up and did them, and did them well by the looks of it!"
27659,You should be proud of yourself.
27660,"Small victories are still victories, baby steps are still movement!"
27661,"Good job, Sweetie!"
27662,"Now, go lay in the sun for 20mins or so and get your Vitamin D!"
27663,Congratulations!!
27664,You did a great job.
27665,"Take care of yourself, celebrate your wins and remember that everything starts with just one step."
27666,Sending you momma hugs.
27667,"Not a Mom, but congrats on this win!"
27668,"Dishes/kitchen cleanliness is a barometer of my mental health, so I don't consider these 'small wins', but rather 'big wins' for myself!"
27669,"Also, I LOVE your kitchen and countertops!"
27670,😍
27671,I know how hard that can be!
27672,I’m really proud of you!
27673,I think you’re awesome!
27674,AND you put your hair up nicely AND got dressed.
27675,3 wins.
27676,Congratulations!
27677,"That is a huge step, and a big accomplishment."
27678,I’m well aware that this is no small feat at all.
27679,Congratulations on such a great job!
27680,!
27681,I’m probably younger than you but good job!
27682,I’m still struggling to bring myself to do the dishes
27683,"Hey sib,

Just to say this is so awesome."
27684,And I'm so glad that you recognise those 'small' wins for what they are.
27685,Huge.
27686,"I hope you're feeling a ray of light coming through the stormclouds at least for a little while, whatever else happens today - remember you DID THE THING!"
27687,"I'm a Dad, but still congratulations champ."
27688,We've all been in crisis mode a looooong time.
27689,Really glad you were able to take a positive step today.
27690,Nice job!
27691,This is a big win!
27692,I'm proud of you!
27693,I'm so happy!!!!
27694,It's all so clean now!!!
27695,"I was gonna make dinner, but you know what, let's keep it clean... wanna order pizza?"
27696,Maybe we can watch a movie!!!
27697,!
27698,"Wonderful job, sweetpea!"
27699,It's great to see you taking steps in the right direction (that being 'forward')!
27700,I hope your accomplishment has made you feel good because you deserve to feel good.
27701,"Keep fighting the good fight, chickadee"
27702,"Hey sib, congrats on conquering the dishes!"
27703,"I’ve been trying to do the same, chronic body pains/depression prevents me from standing for too long, so I’m super jealous about all the work you got done in one go!"
27704,Small wins definitely are big with depression.
27705,I’m proud of you!
27706,"Depression is a monster obstacle, small wins most certainly are big wins."
27707,"Little steps here and there help get us through the day, proud of you!"
27708,Don't be afraid to share your own achievements.
27709,r/Congratslikeimfive
27710,I’ll be your mom for a minute.
27711,"Honey, I am SO Proud of you."
27712,You got out of bed and did something for yourself- hugs and kitchen dances!
27713,I'm an orphan and totally relate.
27714,It's cool to see people posting and encouraging others to support each other and that it's okay to seek support.
27715,So many kids grow up not having support in ways kids with parents even just one parent receives (practically)  unconditionally.
27716,"Enjoy your folks, folks."
27717,Well done!
27718,It’s always hard to get started on something when the black dog hits.
27719,You did great!
27720,"As a mum who has severe depression I know how big of an achievement doing the dishes is.I’m so proud of you and you should be proud of yourself also.❤️
After a week I just did my dishes and I felt almost euphoric 😂only those with depression will understand.I have a to do list that keeps growing but as I ✅off each item I feel like a school kid who passed my exams with flying colours."
27721,I’m sending you a big virtual mum hug and ❤️from 🇦🇺
27722,Wow!
27723,This is amazing!
27724,I’m so proud of you.
27725,You can do great things.
27726,I’m concerned about what you’ve said about your depression tho.
27727,Depression is treatable.
27728,Please consider consider getting help if you haven’t already.
27729,Let me know if you have any questions about it.
27730,Take care of yourself.
27731,You deserve it.
27732,You really really do.
27733,"That's awesome, Sis!"
27734,"I also did the dishes yesterday, after weeks of struggling to do anything in the house!"
27735,\^.^
27736,I just wanted to tell you how proud I am of you.
27737,"I know you had to dig down deep to face that demon, but look at you."
27738,You did it!
27739,"And I know it wasn’t overly fun, but isn’t it just a small relief to know you can at least not have that hanging over you?"
27740,"I’m happy for the relief that you must be feeling, because you know I hate seeing you suffer."
27741,"I wish I could be there for you on your down days, but know that even on the days we don’t see each other in person, I’m always in your heart, & with you in spirit standing right beside rooting you on, or holding your head when you just need to cry, or just sitting quietly with you when you just need to know you’re not alone…I hope this made you feel a little better- and don’t you ever forget that you are worth it, you are loved & you are important… love you, kiddo!"
27742,"Keep on, keeping on!"
27743,"Sis, those are big wins and I'm so proud of you."
27744,"I struggle to get household chores done too, especially when my mental health is declining."
27745,"One person who helped me is [KC Davis](https://www.strugglecare.com/), she teachings that cleanliness is morally neutral and we shouldn't shame or punish ourselves when we struggle to care for ourselves and our living space."
27746,KC has plenty of tips and tricks to help your house work for you especially during bouts of depression.
27747,"If you scroll down to the bottom of her website, you'll find links to her social media."
27748,"She's on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok, so you can see her posts on whatever platform you prefer."
27749,"But whether your dishes are clean or dirty, I still love you, Sis, and I'm proud of every victory, big or small!"
27750,So proud of you.
27751,Even the smallest accomplishments are a big deal.
27752,Now treat yourself to some ice cream.
27753,Have a wonderful day darling - your extended Mom.
27754,Good job baby girl.

27761,You go girl!
27762,"Sister here, I suffer from depression too so I get it, and I am so proud of you sis."
27763,"It looks great, take it one day at a time."

27772,You got this.
27773,Good job!
27774,It’s the small wins right!!!
27775,I just finished two loads of laundry now that I’m coming out of the depression fog.

27778,Just make sure you rest and enjoy the fruits of your labor too!
27779,You have an army of moms here to congratulate you!
27780,"Small wins are huge, sometimes bigger than the perceived big wins."

27929,"I struggle with this also and let me tell you:those ""Little Things"" you accomplish?"
27930,MONUMENTAL.
27931,I'm proud of you.
27932,"One valuable lesson I got out of therapy was to set goals for myself - anywhere between one and three ""Things"" to do each day."
27933,Little Things.
27934,Like brushing my teeth.
27935,Or brushing my hair.
27936,Or DOING THE DISHES WOOOOOO!
27937,And to always celebrate those Things that I got done - and remembering to not beat myself up if I didn't.

Sending virtual hugs to you"
27957,Great job!
27958,This is a big do; I hate the dishes with a passion but a sink full of dirty plates and such can really make you feel worse when you are already in the dumps.
27959,Good on you.
27960,"You know, when I'm feeling real bad but manage to get myself moving and doing, I like to go back and just look at what I've accomplished."

27963,"Sibling here, I understand how hard these things are cause I struggle with them too!"
27964,"It sucks cause the mess makes you feel worse, which in turn makes it harder to fix it."
27965,"I’m so proud of you, you’re being a great influence on everyone else that needs the reminder that it’s ok to have luls & that you can always turn it back around!"
27966,"And I couldn’t help but think of the “you wanna see some real speed” quote & your zoomies made me laugh, so thank you!😂☺️🖤

27975,Enjoy the satisfaction however fleeting.
27976,You can do it again.
27977,I totally get it.
27978,Sometimes you literally have to accept that swinging your feet over the side of the bed and getting into the shower is an accomplishment beyond what others can understand.
27979,Keep fighting.
27980,Fight to be well.
27981,Congrats on every first step.

27994,I am proud of you!
27995,Sometimes the smallest wins are the most important.
27996,"From one Momma to another.....

""LET WHATEVER YOU DO TODAY BE ENOUGH""

I suffer from debilitating depression & anxiety so I KNOW how it takes control & how life altering it can be but, I'M SO VERY PROUD OF YOU not only for doing the dishes but for pushing through another day!!!"
27997,"Just a suggestion- Do something for YOU every day like go for a 10-15 minute walk & take in that Vitamin D, watch a funny movie you love, listen to your favorite upbeat songs, volunteer for an animal rescue group (knowing I make a difference in my own small way always lifts my spirits)."
27998,I make my bed EVERY SINGLE DAY no matter how much I'm suffering because I've accomplished something.
27999,"You don't know me BUT there are lots of people, myself included that care about you, believe in you, are here for you, have so much empathy for you, wish you all the best, think you're so incredibly brave, are so proud of you, know exactly what you're going through, can relate to ALL of it & love you 💗!!!"
28000,"I wish you peace, calm, strength & love...
YOU ARE A WARRIOR - KEEP GOING 😘💐"

28007,Proud of you ❤️
28008,I’m so proud of you!!!!
28009,I know how immobilizing depression can be.
28010,The neglect of self and household care as a result can be extremely overwhelming as well.
28011,It may just be dishes but you being able to do that is such a big step!!!
28012,Good job
28013,That's amazing work you did there.
28014,"Seriously, congrats."
28015,Your kitchen looks amazing.
28016,I live with depression too.
28017,"It sucks and it's hard to do...well, the dishes, among other things."
28018,I'm also a mom.
28019,"If one of my kids was battling depression and they did the dishes or made the bed or got up long enough to take a shower that day, I'd be so proud of them for fighting."
28020,It's hard to fight depression because it makes your brain lie to you.
28021,My advice: try to do one thing a day.
28022,Just one thing.
28023,No zero days.
28024,Keep up the hard work.
28025,You're worth it.
28026,"Even when you feel like you're not, I promise you, you're worth it."

28035,I know how hard it can be to muddle through to get stuff done.
28036,I had a day last week where it was so difficult just to get out of bed.
28037,Well celebrate together!!
28038,💖💖
28039,"Hey, lil sis, every accomplishment is a step forward."
28040,"Also, that seems like a pretty nice house."
28041,You should invite me over for family dinner more often.
28042,I even do dishes.
28043,Hope I made you smile!
28044,"Take care, and know people care for you!"
28045,"I thought I had a lot of anxiety/depression (who knows, probably), but my psychiatrist thinks it could just be massive ADHD."
28046,Something to check for?
28047,"Best of luck, I'm still trying to figure it out."
28048,Big sis here.
28049,I'm so fucking proud of you.

28060,I believe in you and I know that small victories are actually big ones because they add up to the final victory.
28061,You're on the right path and this makes me so happy that you're accomplishing so much despite the inner struggle.
28062,You're truly amazing.
28063,"Keep going, you can do it."
28064,💕🙏
28065,I know sometimes just leaving your cozy nest can be a challenge.
28066,"I'm so proud of everything you've done - getting out of bed, getting dressed, putting your hair into a bun (you look like you mean business!"
28067,"), setting up your camera, tackling those dishes, editing and posting the video...

And if tomorrow you feel like you used too many spoons today, that's okay."
28068,Rest some and make sure you're treating your mind and body with care.
28069,"Pour a cuppa tea, snuggle back into your nest, read a book, grab a shower or a bubble bath, do a word search puzzle...feed your soul."
28070,"Not a mom, but as overwhelming as the kitchen/dishes can be, I always find it cathartic and therapeutic to take care of all that."
28071,"There’s so much in this world that is beyond our control, but we can take care of our own space even if it is simply the kitchen sink."

28083,Well done!
28084,Feel proud of yourself for achieving today.
28085,You beat it this time.
28086,"Absorb all of the good feelings and caring, and next time you have a chore you can’t get started on, recall how good you felt working on your task."
28087,"You did a really cool thing filming it, another accomplishment- awesome!"
28088,💞
28089,You should be very proud of yourself!
28090,Baby steps.
28091,"Life has it’s ups and downs, sometimes the downs can be tough to climb out of."
28092,But it’s the little accomplishments you do every day like the dishes and laundry that can bring joy.

28390,"She is the one missing out not you, she is going to miss seeing her wonderful daughter walking down the Isle to become a wife but you aren't missing anything, you are going to have the most amazing day and you will be so busy celebrating with your husband and guests that you won't even think about her."
28391,If you need to give yourself some time on the morning of your wedding day to have a cry and miss he then do so but then you go get married and have your chosen family beside you.
28392,There is one thing you can thank her for and that is  showing you what not to do as a parent.

28773,"I know it’s hard, but try to focus on the ones that ARE there for you, and came to support you."
28774,"I also wanted to add that I realized at my own wedding, when I had so little people show up for “me”, that my husbands family (his mom & dad are divorced so it was his dads side of the family), sat on “my side” of the church to make it more evened out on both sides, and that even though it was his family, they were also there to support me as well."
28775,Edit for spelling error.

28877,Ooooo fancy!
28878,You will look spectacular!
28879,Part of letting do is forgiving and forgetting.

28881,But you can't forget about them if you don't forgive them first.

29058,Thanks!
29059,This post is perfect!
29060,Thank you so so much for sharing my love
29061,I lived in foster care for years and I’m grateful that you’ve found a family to call your own.
29062,I would have a heart to heart talk with your “parents “ or better to write them a letter and tell them how much they mean to you.
29063,"I’m so proud of you for doing well in school now, it’s amazing what a stable and caring family can do for you."
29064,I wish you all the best and I hope you go on to college and maybe someday you’ll change someone’s life too <3
29065,"I don't know you, but I love you!"
29066,"I grew up without much kindness or compassion so I want you to know this:

This is the family you deserve to have."
29067,Their kindness is not a blessing or a favor.
29068,This is how you are supposed to be treated.
29069,"Kindness, understanding, and respect is an unconditional right we are given at birth."
29070,They are special people but they are not unsual.
29071,I had trouble adjusting to this when I finally found a family that was kind to me.
29072,So use this as a model of how you should treat others and know that you have always been worthy of this.
29073,"Oh love, I'm so happy for you!!"

29075,Oh sweetheart I am so happy for you!!
29076,You sound like you are very happy and loved!!
29077,!
29078,:( I can’t wait to adopt one day
29079,"I’m so happy for you, I was a foster kid and finding a loving family changed my life."
29080,You deserve this!
29081,Maybe your fear of cats could be something you and your foster parents work on together.
29082,I’m so happy for you I could cry 🥺 a good foster home is such a blessing.
29083,I hope you get to create many many many more wonderful memories with your foster family.
29084,♥️♥️♥️
29085,"Sounds really good, Darling."
29086,It will take a while to ease in but you will manage.
29087,One day you will wake up and notice that you didn't worry a whole day and that will be a really cool feeling.
29088,I am so proud of you❤️
29089,"This is so wonderful to hear sweetheart, I'm so glad you're happy in your home and that you are being treated the way you deserve to be - with grace, kindness, patience, trust, and love."
29090,Hearing that you can eat whenever you want broke my heart because it implies some fosters didn't.
29091,"I'm so happy to hear how much you like it, and I know you will thrive there."
29092,You are so loved.
29093,Happy birthday!
29094,I am glad that you have found a safe and happy place.
29095,Both people and animals can be wonderful.
29096,I’m glad you have a nice bed and plenty of food to eat most of all.

29105,It sounds like you’re foster family is really kind.
29106,"Hey, there’s plenty of comments so I doubt you will see it but how old are you and are you in the US?"
29107,I’m asking because I might end up in foster care and I don’t know what to expect.
29108,People only share bad experiences usually.
29109,"Dang, kid!!"
29110,You made me cry.
29111,Congratulations on finding a family.
29112,You truly deserve it.

29117,"Hi sweetheart,
I am so very happy that you were placed in a good home."
29118,I am a social worker that works in child welfare.
29119,"We have gotten a lot better about weeding out the bad homes from the good ones, but some still slip threw the cracks."
29120,I'm not sure what your situation is.
29121,If your slated for reunification  with your bio-parents or if you're going to be in the system and available for adoption someday... but here is what I would advise.
29122,Be honest.
29123,"When you can talk to your foster parents, you tell them how very happy you are, all the things you told us, tell them."
29124,And let them know that you want to stay in their home for as long as possible.
29125,I hope it all works out for you.
29126,"Keep studying hard, I'm so proud of you!!"
29127,!

29136,I’m so proud of you getting a B!

29144,You deserve this stability and happiness.
29145,♥️

29148,"Hell yea, glad you're happy."
29149,I was in foster care from 14 to 21 and I wouldn't be who I am without their love and support.
29150,Hope it all works out for you
29151,You deserve all the good things.
29152,I’m so glad you are where you belong now.
29153,Xx
29154,kitties can be scary.
29155,especially when they still have their claws (which is actually a good thing) but i promise they are really sweet in the long term.
29156,if you ever find it in your heart to let them in they won't let you down.
29157,no pressure tho.
29158,xxx
29159,I hope you get to stay there for forever.

29174,In my house we play the Stevie wonder happy birthday song very loud and on repeat until the birthday person tells us to STOP!
29175,I hope you reach the level where you can tell your new family how happy and comfortable they are making you feel!
29176,It it takes a while that is okay.
29177,Happy birthday sweetie!

29182,Just sending you a huge hug.
29183,I hope that you get to stay there a long long time.
29184,It sounds like one of the good places.
29185,And cats can get scared of people too.
29186,Mine used to be terrified of people and it took years to trust us after we adopted 2 boy cats from a shelter.
29187,Now they happily greet me each day and snuggle up with me on the couch and purr.
29188,They love being fed.
29189,Enjoy and I hope you have many more birthdays here.
29190,"you deserve every bit of it, dear!"
29191,I'm so glad you are safe and cared for and get to enjoy all the things you deserved from the beginning!

29198,"Oh my love, I'm so happy for you!"
29199,Happy Birthday sweetie!
29200,I’m so happy that your foster family is treating you well!
29201,You should share some of these things with your foster parents.
29202,I know they would love hearing about how much you like it there as much as we do.
29203,You deserve it and they sound lovely.
29204,Enjoy your life.
29205,Happy belated birthday.
29206,I woke up to this news on Saturday morning and it made me smile and cry.
29207,"You deserve to feel safe, loved and cared for!"
29208,"Congratulations on your B and I agree, not a cat fan, but they tend to love those that ignore them."
29209,Be prepared for the cats to jump in your lap for a pet.
29210,This is the best thing I’ve read in a while.
29211,I’m so happy for you honey.
29212,You deserve all the love and happiness in the world.
29213,And happy belated birthday!
29214,Happy belated birthday from your big sister!
29215,Oh gosh.

29217,IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!
29218,!
29219,It sounds like your foster family has gone out of their way to make sure you are happy and comfortable.
29220,Maybe you should do the same in return.
29221,I'm very very happy for you.
29222,Return their love to them and you'll do really well together.

29234,Congratulations kiddo !
29235,I hope you feel this safe and secure from now on.
29236,Everybody deserves to feel this.
29237,Dad here!
29238,"Just wanted to say that, if you feel comfortable doing it, let them know if you'd like something to be different."
29239,"They sound really great, and sometimes people feel bad asking for something they need when the people around them are so nice

Also (again, if you feel comfortable!)"
29240,", go ahead and let them know how much this stuff means to you."
29241,"As a dad, we hope we are doing the right things, but we often don't know."
29242,"So when something is good, we'd love to know about it!"
29243,I'm so happy things are going well!
29244,You deserve to have this - a comfortable place to stay and a loving home.

29252,You deserve this.
29253,You’ve been so strong and brave for so long.
29254,I am proud of you.
29255,"I want you to know you can do great things…no, that you WILL do great things."
29256,I was a foster kid.
29257,Went through the system a few times.
29258,"I feel like 40% of the homes are not the best, 40% are just doing it for money, and the remaining 20% are genuinely there to help."
29259,I'm glad you found a good one.
29260,"Of all the ones I had been in, only one gave me a sense of family and felt like a ""home""."
29261,The rest felt like I was renting a room.
29262,Take the good and run with it.
29263,Be the change you want to see in the world.
29264,So glad you got the family you deserve.
29265,Of course it is awkward around your siblings...you will all warm up to eachother!
29266,Good luck in school dear.
29267,Happy birthday!

29275,I’m so glad for you!!
29276,It sounds like you’ve got a good fit.
29277,Plus the opportunity to live on a farm!
29278,Farms are fun (most of the time).
29279,"Just as a reminder, you should always be getting to eat what you want and get presents for your birthday, sweetie."
29280,I’m sorry you haven’t had that before.
29281,I’m glad you have it now.
29282,Happy birthday sweetheart!
29283,You deserve to be loved and treated with kindness and warmth.
29284,I am so happy you are with a family that gives you all of the love and support you should have gotten from the very beginning!
29285,I'm so proud of you for doing so well in school!
29286,You are going succeed in life no matter what you choose to do.
29287,"And most importantly, family isn't the people who are biologically related to you, family is the people who show you that they love you and care about you."
29288,Family are the people who make you feel special and included for no reason at all other than you are you.
29289,Keep those kinds of people in your life.
29290,"I'm so happy for you sweetie, and I am so proud of you."
29291,Happy birthday my little ladybug.
29292,🐞❣️🎂
29293,I love this for you!
29294,I wish all foster homes could be this safe and loving.
29295,"Sounds like you got extremely lucky, and you deserve the happiness and safety they are giving you."
29296,Enjoy it ❤️
29297,That's great to hear!
29298,I'm so happy you're in a safe place where you can thrive.
29299,I get the fear of cats.
29300,My grandma was attacked once by several when she was little.
29301,She never really got over it.
29302,She does well with my cat though.
29303,She's a generally sweet girl who just wants to know she's loved.
29304,It may take time for you to get used to being around them or it may never happen.
29305,Hi Ladybug!
29306,Happy Birthday!
29307,I'm so proud of you for that B!
29308,I bet you worked really hard!
29309,"I'm glad you're in a safe place where you can grow!-- Love, Mama Dani"
29310,This is so heartwarming it made me tear up.
29311,I hope to be a foster mom someday and hope my kiddos feel just as welcome and safe.
29312,This made me cry!
29313,I am so happy for you!
29314,I’m so glad you’re somewhere safe and comfortable <3

29319,I’m so glad you have a wonderful place to live and have a room to make your own.
29320,I hope you’ve enjoyed the vacations and visiting new places.
29321,"I’m happy you have food to eat, especially good food."
29322,Maybe you can learn to cook?
29323,I’m so proud you’ve brought your grades up!
29324,I’m praying that living in a big family and selling at the markets will help ease your anxiety of being in crowds.
29325,I hope your brothers visit soon!
29326,"Love you, hun!"
29327,"Belated birthday wishes, sweetie."
29328,It sounds like you have had a great womb emancipation anniversary.
29329,It was really a gut punch to hear that presents “confused” you.
29330,"I am old, but as a kid I didn’t get things from my parents— they had 6 other kids and it wasn’t too easy back then."
29331,"Now my husband &kids like to give me gifts, but I recall the empty feeling of not having a “typical” birthday experience with gifts and all that."
29332,You have been blessed with a wonderful foster family.
29333,It’s okay if you take time to accept your good fortune.
29334,It’s called a blessing.
29335,The powers that be have looked on you & said “that child deserves better.”  Now you can choose to pass on any good fortune you can — help others.
29336,Go forth and do good.
29337,It will make someone else’s life better.
29338,Even if it’s a small thing.
29339,Compliment someone.
29340,Throw some change in a beggar’s cup.
29341,Help someone when you see they need it.
29342,"🦋♥️🍀♥️🦋

29350,🎂🎉
29351,Former foster kid here.
29352,Im glad to see you enjoying this family.
29353,"I dont know if you're in the US, but most of the time, from what I understand in my experience, any kind of government service only allots so much money towards getting you gifts."
29354,So the fact you had gifts was more than likely because they went into their own pocket.
29355,"Plus the decorations, the painting, the vacations- theyre a real good family."
29356,I hope you have found your forever home.
29357,Send us updates?
29358,I just want to say I'm very happy for you.
29359,"You deserve comfort, safety, stability, and calm."
29360,"I don't know what your situation is, but if there's a mixture of feelings (happy, nervous, embarrassment, fear of ""not being true"" to your bio family), remember all your feelings are valid."
29361,Emotions are complicated.
29362,Maybe journal write or paint if it helps.
29363,But remember to just live in every moment.
29364,Celebrate the good things.
29365,You are worth good things.
29366,"Sister here, Im SO PROUD OF YOU for letting yourself be happy."
29367,Im proud of your progress.
29368,My heart is happy reading this for you and I hope you get to stay for as long as you want.
29369,"Im glad youre experiencing safety and happiness 

P.s."
29370,if you have questions about cats let me know.
29371,Ive owned over 10 and work with cats for my job
29372,Well done on your test results.
29373,Take things a bit at a time and you'll get more confident around people.
29374,Not everyone likes cats and that's ok.
29375,They just want someone warm to lean on and food ha ha.
29376,"Happy Birthday, I'm glad you had a good time."
29377,"I'm sure your foster parents will be glad you like it there, they were nervous too I expect."
29378,Many hugs

29461,I’m hoping the mom secretly finds this post somehow through consent of the OP
29462,Hello!
29463,I am a child on DCP I’ve been in care for 13 years (I’m 16 now) I’m so happy you found a good place.
29464,"If you ever need to chat or talk, (about anything) I’d love to!"
29465,Awww this post isnt too long.
29466,So glad you found your family
29467,I’m so happy for you!
29468,You deserve to have a good life.
29469,Get an A next time
29470,Thank you
29471,"Truly OP, if you are comfortable, this will mean a lot to them."
29472,100%!
29473,"You can even write it in a letter if that’s easier for you, OP."
29474,And you have such a way with words I think it would be extra special 🤍
29475,One of the cats tries to go near me.
29476,My foster mom or one of my foster siblings has to pick him up when he gets too close.
29477,I stay in my room with the door closed when the cats are inside or not in a room
29478,"OP, I'm so happy that you are in a place with good people!"
29479,Throwing in my two cents about cats - the absolute best way to make friends with them is to *not touch them* and give them a comfy place to curl up.
29480,I look after toddlers and the first thing I do when I start my shift is fold up a blanket for the cat and then invite them to sit on it (pat it while the cat is watching).
29481,"The cat knows that the blanket is their space and I won't let the toddler near it, so the cat feels safe."
29482,"As far as not touching them, every cat has their own preferences."
29483,"Most cats get overstimulated at some point by being petted and people can be really bad at noticing when that is happening, which is one of the reasons cats go from ""I like this"" to biting to make it stop."
29484,"So I suggest not petting a cat unless they pet you, like rubbing their cheek against you."
29485,"And then you can pet their head three times, until you know what the cat likes."
29486,"If the cat wants more attention, they will ask."
29487,"Bottom line, don't go into their space and give them a comfy place to people-watch and they will love you."
29488,"I am deathly allergic to cats if I touch my face after petting one, and it's ridiculous how they swarm me and jump on me and fight with each other for my attention."
29489,"I just have to wash my hands really, really well after petting them and then change my clothes and wash those heartily as well."
29490,I can testify to the hate-love attraction.
29491,Thank you
29492,Thank you!
29493,I don’t usually get b’s but I think I’m doing a lot better in online school.
29494,Thanks.
29495,My brothers aged out already but my foster parents said they can visit.
29496,One of my brothers said he’s gonna come for thanksgiving.
29497,Agreed.
29498,I can now go to sleep.
29499,😴
29500,Thank you!
29501,I forgot to mention this in the post but my foster mom and her dad go to the farmers market every Saturday to sell stuff and my younger foster sister and I go with them and they let us sell stuff so we make bracelets or soap or candles or lemonade or whatever else we can think of and we split whatever we make.
29502,One time we each got $100 after we paid for the supplies.
29503,The only downside is we have to leave the house at 5 in the morning but we always stop for donuts and my foster mom makes us coffee on Saturdays.
29504,It’s a lot of fun.
29505,Thank you
29506,"It was so cute you mentioned getting B, appreciate small wins."
29507,That cat can tell.
29508,I bet it would just snuggle you all day if you let it.
29509,Cats are quirky.
29510,I had a friend come over once who did not like cats.
29511,"My cat, a stray that I bottle fed from when she was 2 weeks old so she was what they call a “bottle brat,” sensed he didn’t like cats and proceeded to get comfy on his lap."
29512,When she started purring my friend was a bit freaked out.
29513,He had never heard a cat purr.
29514,"I was like, “she’s purring, she likes you!” He sat the rest of the visit petting her head."
29515,But I get it.
29516,"My daughter is deathly terrified of dogs, so you should absolutely not have to be around them if you are scared of them."
29517,I had to get over my fear of cats too.
29518,"Now, me and my roommates cat are best buddies and she actively chooses to spend time with me."
29519,That's great.
29520,In person schooling isn't for everyone.
29521,Even full days of schooling doesn't work for everyone.
29522,My sophomore year of highschool I went to a smaller charter school where I did some work at home that a teacher assigned me and other days I had one class in person.
29523,In all I went to school maybe 2 or 3 days a week for about 2 hours a day.
29524,It really helped me out.
29525,"I'm glad that you found what works for you, and getting a B is amazing."
29526,I'm proud of you
29527,Just keep asking questions when you have them and studying hard.
29528,I know you’ll be getting A’s too in no time.
29529,:)
29530,thats awesome!!
29531,im so happy for you :)
29532,"Oh, it’s so nice!"
29533,I’m glad you have fun and are taken care of!
29534,Have a nice day!
29535,❤️
29536,I used to be afraid of dogs too.
29537,Now I like little dogs.
29538,They have a big dog but she’s old and mostly sleeps and I’m used to her.
29539,Just want to throw in that cats don‘t do this because they want to be an ass.
29540,Starring at them and being „too much“ is very impolite in a cat’s world.
29541,So if you don‘t like cats and avoid them the cat thinks you are just very polite and well behaved lol.
29542,Which means they tend to find you sympathetic.
29543,Secondly most cats are really sensible and notice when you are feeling distressed.
29544,If they come to you and start purring they might just want to take care of you and calm you down.
29545,Nevertheless it‘s still completely fine to not like cats and avoid them :)
29546,Being chosen is one of the most special things that can happen to a person.
29547,It’s the best!
29548,Thank you.
29549,"There’s other kids at the farmers market and my foster sister, the other kids, and I usually go to the park for a little bit but it’s kinda cold so we’re gonna go to the community center right next to it."
29550,They have a new game room.
29551,My foster mom packed us snacks and cookies.
29552,My foster sister and I sold all of the candles that we made.
29553,My foster mom said maybe on Monday she’ll take us to open savings accounts instead of keeping our money in safes in our rooms.
29554,"She likes the idea of dogs, lol."
29555,"She wants a dog, pretends to be a dog, plays with stuffed dogs, but the moment she’s in the presence of a real dog, no matter how big or small, she panics and cries."
29556,We are working on it.
29557,"She also used to not like our cats, and would only pet them as they walked away from her (I guess she didn’t like their faces, I don’t know), but now she’s all about our cat (the other cat from my story recently died, she was like 17)."
29558,"You heal that heart and grow strong at your foster home, okay fellow 914?"
29559,Oh it’s seems great sweetie!
29560,So happy for you!
29561,I’ll try.
29562,One of my foster siblings and I aren’t getting along and I’m upset about that but my foster dad said she’ll get over it and she’s just being stubborn.
29563,Do you know any calm small dogs?
29564,"If you do, have the owner offer the back end to your daughter (if your daughter is up to it!)."
29565,"She can touch their tail, or rear end without the fear of being bitten."
29566,We know a young lady that started like that.
29567,She would only ever pet the rear end of a dog if the owner was essentially restraining the front end.
29568,She worked her way up and now own her own chocolate lab!
29569,"This is ok, OP."
29570,*Healthy* disagreements are part of normal life.
29571,"It's important to learn that you can safely disagree, and move past it, and it's not the end of the world."
29572,"Not everyone is going to get along with everyone all the time, and that's ok.

Edit: he to the"
29573,Maybe you could do something that's just the kids (not just you two but all your siblings) together?
29574,Maybe if she gets to spend some time with you in a fun setting that'll help break some of the ice.
29575,"Kind of like a group date, where you're getting to know one another but without the pressure of being one on one."
29576,"Anyway, just an idea."
29577,\*hug\*
29578,"Sister here, and I'm super proud of you :D look fabulous in that gown btw"

30006,Or sometimes all the trash I have the mental and physical energy to pick up.
30007,Is it 'totally clean'?

30014,"As a tip, I always pick a day in my week to clean my apartment."
30015,"Doesn't need to be super thorough, or if you feel like you can't do much, just clean a bit so it doesn't completely go back to its old state."
30016,"And always take a piece of trash with you whenever you stand up and go somewhere in your apartment, e.g."
30017,the bathroom.

30062,"Wow, you did a lovely job."
30063,May I suggest you treat yourself to a few cord keepers and an extension cord to run along the wall so you don’t trip or can hide the cord under the settee/rug.
30064,Also would a fashionable bin nearby help with keeping trash easier to manage?
30065,I am all for making my life but if my suggestions are not really helpful please disregard and enjoy playing your game in a sunny clean room.
30066,You deserve it!
30067,"Great work, kid."
30068,You worked really hard to get that done.
30069,Mom is curious; do you find this is a cycle for you?
30070,"Do you find it mostly impossible to get the motivation, but when you do, you probably clean top to bottom/there is little in between?"
30071,Do you already have an ADHD diagnosis?
30072,Sorry to be nosey.
30073,Mom just wants to make sure you’re getting the right tools in life to be/feel your best version.

30265,Nice work!
30266,I notice that when my house reaches a certain level of mess I feel overwhelmed and paralyzed by it and it can be hard to even attempt cleaning.
30267,But then once you start it can be kind of addictive.
30268,And then the end product feels SO GOOD!
30269,I think it's true what they say about a cluttered space leading to a cluttered mind.
30270,It causes stress if you're surrounded by stuff.

30277,You're human and it's literally not possible to do everything.
30278,Just getting through the day is enough.
30279,Be kind and patient with yourself.
30280,"It helps me to think ""if it were my friend, what would I say?"

30375,"Hey, sis here, just wanted to add that it's ok if you don't manage to keep on top of it either!"
30376,"We all have those days, and it's not the end of the world if things become messy again for a while."

30380,Maybe Tuesday you’ll clean all the trash.
30381,Wednesday you’ll collect dishes.
30382,Etc.
30383,"You can do this while it’s clean, too, to keep it clean!"
30384,And you can do it for your whole home!
30385,"Like, Tuesday could be trash day everywhere."
30386,"Wednesday, all the dishes get picked up."

30391,I love this!
30392,"Thank you for sharing, aunty!"
30393,Yes!
30394,This is how I'm teaching my daughters to clean.
30395,Break it up into smaller jobs.
30396,Tick one job off and take a break.
30397,When you're able to come back to it there's less to deal with and you're not starting from ground zero.
30398,"Thank you for the advice, Aunty!"
30399,I hit max level about a week ago!
30400,"Leveling priest was tough, but I love playing healer."

You can always reset it, that’s something that I like to keep in mind when lack of time or low mental health makes me let my get space messy."
30406,"I just think back on the time it used to be worse, but I was able to make & sustain it for a time."
30407,"It’s not that you’re lazy or bad for not keeping up with it, but life & mental blocks get in the way & that’s natural!"
30408,Just remember you did it before so you know it’s possible!☺️

30417,Hope you enjoy :) the latest xpac is quite nice and since it's now near the end of the cycle you get to experience everything at your own pace.
30418,Much love to you 💕
30419,Healing is my jam!
30420,I used to main a resto shammie and then a resto drood.
30421,I miss it!
30422,"It honestly taught me some real life skills (multi tasking, prioritizing, situational awareness, organization, etc) and gave me the confidence to learn to play violin as an adult (if I can heal a raid/bg using muscle memory built around using Grid/Clique and my Razor Naga, surely I can build muscle memory on a stringed instrument too)."
30423,You did great cleaning your space!
30424,Now you can game with a clear mind.
30425,😊

30431,World of Warcraft!
30432,"A few years back, we had almost no money for Christmas for the other children in my family."
30433,"So I made tie blankets, as that was near all I could afford (the fabric was gifted to me)."
30434,All the kids still have their blankets.
30435,They love them.
30436,"Your stuffies are precious, and I'm certain that they will be loved and cherished for many years to come."
30437,❤
30438,"That's a designer quality bunny, honestly!"
30439,"People would absolutely buy those and they're unique, don't be worried."
30440,The kiddos will love them ❤ Hand made gifts are special!
30441,what's really cute is that if you save the pattern the kids can design clothes for it and you may be able to make those drawing real for birthday presents or a just thinking of you present.
30442,Dad here.
30443,Uh... That's adorable.
30444,I'd totally buy one for my toddler (and forthcoming baby) if you ever decide to make more!
30445,Adorable.
30446,You’re wonderful.
30447,I’m certain they will smile big as I am now.
30448,"A home-made gift is so precious and special, you can't buy that kind of love and thoughtfulness."
30449,They'll feel that love you have for them every time they hold their cute little plushies.
30450,"You sound like a great mom, OP"
30451,"Oh my goodness this is so cute, your kiddos are gonna love them."
30452,Merry Christmas ❤️
30453,I would absolutely buy that.
30454,Message me if you ever open an Etsy store or something!
30455,Those are soooo cute!
30456,I’m sure they will love them to pieces.
30457,Make sure you reinforce the buttons!
30458,The Christmas presents that give me the fondest memories are those when scarcity had to be made up for with ingenuity.
30459,You bet I still have all of those.
30460,"That stuffy looks gorgeous (and, mind you, since handmade is so rare and sweet looking, high end kids' stores sell them here and you wouldn't believe how expensive they are!"
30461,"), have a sweet fun Christmas that'll stick with them forever!"
30462,Kids don't care about the money spent.
30463,"If I got a stuffy my mom made, I would be thrilled and I'm 24."
30464,Your kids are going to adore it because you made it with love.
30465,My favorite gifts I received as a child were handmade dolls made by my great grandmother and I played with them for years.
30466,I still have both of them and my oldest is 3 now and likes to play with his momma babies as he calls them.
30467,I think those loveys are a perfect gift!
30468,"That is the most beautiful stuffy, and filled with love."
30469,You have a real talent!
30470,I'm sure the little ones are going to love them so much and treasure them always.
30471,You're such a wonderful mom.
30472,Have a wonderful Christmas with your babies ❤️
30473,I still sleep with my stuffies even though I’m legally an adult now.
30474,"(I can’t sleep without hugging something, no clue why.)"
30475,I would love to buy one of these guys.
30476,It looks so cute!
30477,Oh my goodness it’s adorable!
30478,"Save the pattern and make a day of teaching your kids how to make them, too."
30479,This bunny can be a precious family tradition.
30480,You're a fantastic mom.
30481,"I'm sure they'll love them, all the love and attention you put in these beautiful stuffed animals mean so much more than anything you can buy at the store."
30482,I want to buy one of these if you start selling!
30483,Absolutely adorable!!!
30484,!
30485,"So sweet and special, I love it"
30486,There's been a number of years where the money just wasn't there.
30487,"My three kids all have their birthdays just before & just after the holidays so it's especially hard sometimes to be able to make good on all of those gifts, the cakes, etc."
30488,"Many many times I'd stay up super late for nights on end crocheting hats, gloves, stuffies, making cakes & decorating them myself."
30489,They've always loved it.
30490,"Great job, mom!"
30491,Oh my goodness.
30492,You made this?
30493,It is gorgeous.
30494,Your little ones are going to be so happy and they will cherish these for years to come.
30495,What a beautiful gift.
30496,Those would sell for at least $40 on esty.
30497,You have a talent.
30498,Did you embroider the face?!?
30499,Adorable.
30500,"That is some serious talent, and some seriously good parenting."
30501,"Christmas isn't always easy, but you're making the most of it and still doing everything you can to make this Christmas very merry."
30502,You could consider selling things like this on Etsy or similar sites.
30503,"It takes alot of talent, skill and experience to make something so intricate and cute."
30504,So cute!
30505,They will cherish them.
30506,I still have the doll my Mommom made for me when I was little.
30507,I am so proud of you!
30508,What a thoughtful and beautiful gift.
30509,This is so much more precious than anything you can buy from a store.
30510,They’ll most definitely cherish these their whole lives and think of you whenever they see them.
30511,Visible love and care went into that adorable little stuffy.
30512,"Wow hey are so well done, congratulation you are doing an amazing job don’t worry!!"
30513,!
30514,I’m so sorry things are tough for you right now Duckling.
30515,I know you are doing your best for you and your little ones.
30516,They will adore the stuffies!
30517,Homemade gifts are so very special.
30518,Happy Christmas!
30519,!
30520,"If my mom made me a stuffy for Christmas, I would have loved it until it was in tatters and then woulda loved it some more."
30521,Those are going to be lifelong toys.
30522,Can I purchase one from you?
30523,That’s one of the most adorable plushes I have ever seen!
30524,A one-of-a-kind item like that should go for $100 minimum.
30525,Message me if you’d be willing to work something out 💜.
30526,Best.
30527,Mom.
30528,Ever.
30529,❤️
30530,This looks amazing!
30531,"The gifts I remember most from my childhood are those my mom made, so I’m sure these will be a hit."
30532,"Looks bomb, could be something from a Insta How to sew.. Add."
30533,"Personally I would try to make some additional things like clothes to change or some a carrot, maybe with a face to."
30534,"And maybe use some different textures like clay or a fuzzy fabric, so its fun to touch it and adds a additional stimulation(I really love fluffy things :-D)

Please dont feel bad about your present-its really lovely and looks quite modern and not like a""gross, low income diy present""its really adorable."
30535,My mom sewed me a doll when I was 7.
30536,My dad had left her for another woman and we were dirt poor.
30537,I loved that doll so much!
30538,I am 58 years old and still have it!
30539,You are going to delight your kids!
30540,On Christmas Day you and the children can build holiday homes for the stuffies out of boxes and paper and blankets.
30541,Have a picnic with the stuffies.
30542,The little ones will remember this Christmas as one of the magic ones.
30543,Making up stories about these new stuffie friends with the children is also a special imagination spark.
30544,"((Hugs))... time spent, memories made, matter most"
30545,as a former kid myself I can guarantee you this would have been an absolutely treasured gift.
30546,I have no doubt your little ones with feel the same!
30547,Merry Christmas!
30548,"Merry Christmas, Dear One!"
30549,These are wonderful presents that will make your kiddos smile.
30550,"You may not have a lot of money this year, but you have a lot of creativity and love, and your kids need that more than any toy."
30551,Oh how adorable!
30552,I still have so many of the homemade gifts from my Mom and Gma - I treasure them so much.
30553,Your kids are so lucky to have you and I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas!
30554,It’s adorable!
30555,"Those are absolutely adorable, and much more meaningful than just buying some random thing."
30556,Love it!!!
30557,"One quick thing though, if your children are really young you might want to be super careful about the buttons, and maybe just sew the arms on directly."
30558,They can be a serious choking hazard if they are a certain diameter.
30559,You did such a beautiful job!!
30560,What a lovely little face.
30561,I’m sure your kids will cherish and love them.
30562,Oh Sweetie!
30563,This is absolutely wonderful and I'm so proud of what a good mommy you are!
30564,"oh those are adorable, sister!"
30565,absolutely cute and i think they will be loved for a long time.
30566,great job.
30567,hopefully things will turn around for you soon.
30568,That stuffy is so cute!!!!
30569,I’m sure that these will be cherished far longer than any store bought toy
30570,"that stuffy is the cutest thing ever, i’m obsessed 🤩"
30571,"Your kids will adore them, they‘re wonderful!"
30572,"I still have a toy my mum sewed for me when I was 6 or so, it‘s one of my most treasured possessions, even over a quarter of a century later."
30573,"If it‘s not too labour-intensive, and you enjoy it, you could probably make a little extra cash selling these on Etsy - I‘d buy one!"
30574,This is adorable!!
30575,I’m sure they’ll love them!
30576,"Oh my gosh, HOW CUTE!"
30577,"I love the face, it just looks so happy and calm."
30578,Your kids will love it for sure!
30579,"My brother in law once got a plushy (a dog) from his mom and he loved it so much, he is still heartbroken that it got lost a good 40+ years ago."
30580,That is so cute!
30581,What did you use for the face?
30582,It's really cute!
30583,I love it.
30584,"My mom was a single teen mom, so we had lots of ""bare"" Christmases."
30585,One of our traditions was making homemade cards and decorations from her company's used paper (think of the kind printed with the tabbed edges down the sides with perforations) that she would hoard throughout the year.
30586,"Our gift to each other for many years was privacy with the crayons, scissors, tape, and as much of that paper as we needed to create our gifts."
30587,When I was five or six--just old enough to be trusted with those precious scissors--I made my mom a hideous jewelry box.
30588,"She acted like it was the most amazing thing ever and actually used it, which made me feel like a hero."
30589,"That crappy ""jewelry box"" still held pride of place on top of her dresser when she passed away."
30590,"The thing is, I was always so excited to make her something special that it was years before I realized how poor we had been."
30591,And her paper gifts to me were priceless treasures.
30592,"Even after she had earned her degrees and was killing it in her industry, we continued the hand-made paper gift tradition."
30593,"Trust me, your kids are going to love these stuffies!"
30594,Way to go!
30595,"Lovely stuffies, very clever!"
30596,So long as there’s love and laughter the kids won’t mind.
30597,"Another fun thing they can do with you is cut snowflakes from old newspaper or wrapping off cuts, also use these to make paper chains like we did when I was a kid - lots of fun with safe craft scissors even for quite small kids."
30598,"And a little treasure hunt (get one of those $2 packs of gold choc coins) , etc etc."
30599,"when I was small, and my parents were stony broke, my favorite Xmas thing was the mandarin or clementine orange that would be at the very toe of our stockings!"
30600,Thoughtful gifts are the ones we treasure.
30601,"I'm sure your children will love the stuffies, your rabbit looks very stylish, I think it's great!"
30602,The best thing about christmas is spending quality time with the loved ones.
30603,You are absolutely capable of making this a special christmas for your little ones.
30604,I hope someone makes it really special for you too.
30605,Happy christmas darling!
30606,That’s adorable!!
30607,Your little one’s going to love it.
30608,❤️
30609,"It's not about the presents, it's about the time that you spend together."
30610,There isn't a reason too feel bad.
30611,None.
30612,But cute stuffiest!!!!
30613,Just do what you can... And be there for your little ones.
30614,They will remember that over anything else.
30615,Mum hugs!
30616,That’s gorgeous!
30617,You’re very talented.
30618,People would pay a very high price for a handmade bunny like that on Etsy or somewhere.
30619,But the fact you made it with love means it’s worth even more.
30620,Your kids won't remember flashy toys or big presents.
30621,They won't remember huge feasts.
30622,"They'll remember the love, the happiness, the fun that you created."
30623,My favourite Christmas present was a paddling pool full of plastic balls.
30624,Wow!
30625,They are adorable.
30626,I would totally buy one for my son or be very happy if someone brought me one.
30627,I’m proud of you for powering through and making something beautiful for your kids.
30628,Sending you warm hugs and Christmas wishes
30629,These are so stinking cute!
30630,"If one was gifted to me, I would love ot"
30631,These are adorable!
30632,I wouod be thrilled if I were gifted one!
30633,"Me at age 5 would have LOVED that, because it’s a cute toy my mom made."
30634,"Me at my current age 23 would also ABSOLUTELY love that, because I can tell money is right but my mom still put in the time to make me something she thought I’d love (and because it’s a cute toy)."
30635,If your kids are interested in crafting you should have them design clothes or toys for the stuffies and then make them together.
30636,My mom used to make me dresses when I was a kid and she’d teach me how to make (really simplified) mini-me dresses and bags for my toys and I loved it.
30637,I felt like such a cool grown up hand stitching next to my mom on the sewing machine.
30638,We used to use old clothes or buy cheap fabric on sale and use that too so it wasn’t super expensive.
30639,"Hey, sibling!"
30640,This looks great.
30641,It's an amazing use of your skills!
30642,"Yeah, I know when we were growing up it wasn't necessarily cool to have homemade gifts, but I think that's not necessarily the case nowadays."
30643,I think this could lead to something lasting and truly appreciated.
30644,"I don't know if the kids are old enough to start learning how to sew, but for future gifts they can work with you to design clothes/accessories for these little lovies."
30645,They'll love being involved & it makes the toys that much more special.
30646,They look amazing and any kid would be over the moon to have such a great stuffie!
30647,But your kids?
30648,Knowing mom made them????
30649,They're gonna be over the moon
30650,What a beautiful gift.
30651,"It’s fantastic that you’re taking the time to give some joy with what you have available, and your skills."
30652,This is honestly how lovely traditions start.
30653,Something made from the heart that really conveys the spirit of giving a gift.
30654,(I do this for teachers gifts.
30655,"I try to make something useful, but inexpensive to keep our budget on track but show our appreciation."
30656,This year it was pocket hand warmers and heating bags filled with rice.)
30657,That’s an adorable bunny.
30658,"This is wonderful 💜 Your little ones are sure to love them and cherish them for years 🤗


(One year my mom handmade me a Pound Puppy and I still have it."
30659,"She saved the pattern [mostly because we just don't throw anything away 😆] and they've been made for grandkids and this year, a great-grandchild.)"
30660,They’re beautiful!!
30661,"I can see and feel the love in every single stitch 💝 
You did a great job honey and should be proud"
30662,Good job.
30663,You are an amazing parent and artist.
30664,This is a gift to be proud of.
30665,Wow what an absolute amazing present.
30666,"The bunny looks so cute, adorable, huggable and loveable."
30667,"The best presents I’ve ever received, were always those given with much love."
30668,"And I’ve cherished and treasured the presents that were handmade for me for years to come, some I still have decades later."
30669,"This looks like so much more than a Christmas present, it’s a token of your love and a cuddly friend who’ll be there for them for years to come."
30670,Well done x
30671,I'm not a mum and this is the first time I've felt the need to comment but that bunny is beautiful.
30672,It'll be treasured for years to come
30673,"These are just so adorable, and your kids will love them."
30674,I bet they'll still have them as adults!
30675,Some of my favourite toys were rag dolls my Nana made me.
30676,I still have them for my daughter to play with.
30677,Your children are going to love these.
30678,That is a beautiful bunny!
30679,I’m sure the kids will love it.
30680,I can tell how much love for them you put into it.
30681,"I have received many gifts of the years, this made my heart warm, I can’t think of a better way to show your love."
30682,My grandpa handmade these little puzzle piece rocking chairs for all the grandchildren and my grandma made us all little stuffies.
30683,We all still have both.
30684,Both grandparents were gone sooner than expected so they're treasured memories.
30685,You cannot replace and handmade gift.
30686,gifts like these are going to be absolutely priceless in a few decades.
30687,handmade gifts are the absolute best.
30688,"PS5s are cool, but that won't be wanted in 20y."
30689,that stuffie tho?
30690,will likely become one of their most cherished possessions.
30691,it's the love that matters and the fact that all you want is to make them happy makes my whole week.
30692,Merry Christmas (Happy Holidays) to you and your family :)
30693,Read the Christmas chapters of Laura Ingalls Wilder Little House in the Big Woods.
30694,Those are so cute!
30695,I absolutely love handmade gifts
30696,The kids will love these.
30697,So so adorable :)
30698,those are so cute!!!
30699,"I remember staying up late at night watching my mom sew my Christmas presents a few years, I wish I still had them."
30700,They are beautiful stuffies ….
30701,So perfect
30702,I love that.
30703,I would love to make one with my kid.
30704,Do you have a pattern or a website or anything?
30705,Looks like Christmas will be extra special with toys made by mom with love.
30706,Cant get anything better than that
30707,Hey sis.
30708,I would have loved and cherished a homemade gift from my mom like this forever.
30709,Your little ones are lucky to have you.
30710,Same with my young family.
30711,Many years ago.
30712,We were having a Great time figuring out how to make our own presents  - with finding rules to an ancient board game and making our own being the highlight.
30713,Spouse and I were very happy with this plan.
30714,Then my mom found out we were broke and took all of our air out by sending a Ton of stuff cross country.
30715,Don't let anyone take away your ability to find a way to make life work for you.
30716,Family and celebration are not about $$

30733,"I grew up very wealthy, but time with my mom was limited."
30734,"She gave me a blanket she made me when I was 13, which is a lot for someone who hates crafts or anything sentimental."
30735,I’m snuggled up in right now nearly 20 years later.
30736,I don’t remember many Christmas gifts as a kid but I remember that one.
30737,"Oh, Sweetie!"
30738,The love you are putting into those stuffies will touch your children’s hearts for decades.
30739,"When they are grown, they will look at those dolls you made and their hearts will swell knowing how hard you worked to give them a happy Christmas during the lean times."
30740,"You are such a good Mama, and I am so proud of you!"
30741,Hold those babies tight.
30742,They know how much you love them.

30772,Your stuffies are so cute!
30773,"Your little ones will love them for years to come, I assure you."
30774,"My mom used to knit when I was little, and she knit me this super soft blanket one year when I was like 7 or 8."
30775,"I still have that blanket, it's one of my most treasured possessions."
30776,Hand made gifts are the best gifts anyone could ask for.
30777,I love this ❤️ your kiddos are going to love it.

30785,"I can't show these to my niece and nephew, because they love stuffies and will want them too."
30786,:)
30787,The only Christmas gift I can even remember is the Christmas stocking my Mom knitted me.
30788,"It's hanging on the wall behind me right now, probably 20 years later."
30789,"You've done a great job, the face is lovely, I'm sure your children will love them."
30790,"You're giving your children your love, your time, your work."
30791,None of us can ask for more.
30792,This is so sweet!
30793,I did a lot of sewing and crafts projects during years when we had no money.

30796,That is an incredibly cute stuffie!
30797,Every stitch contains your love!
30798,"If your kids are too small to really get that, please know that they will grow into the knowledge that you created something (one-of-a-kind!)"
30799,"with your own hands, especially for them."
30800,"Even if they don't know the whole story now, they will."
30801,This is the kind of present that becomes a treasure!
30802,That is some solid stitching!

30834,Let’s help them out!
30835,My favorite Christmas gift of all time was a handmade puppet my Mom made for me.
30836,"My dad was kind of a dick who hated me, and this one year he only gave Mom money for purchased presents for my siblings."
30837,So she made me a puppet.
30838,He was so disappointed when I burst into tears from happiness at receiving that goofy puppet.
30839,OP's kids are going to love that rabbit <3.
30840,"My favourite part of making these is that I use old blankets and clothes from the kids, so it's recycled materials that are pieces of their life growing up."

31078,As a kid we immigrated and couldn’t afford presents.
31079,"My mother made us chair cushions, duvet cover and a rubbish bin out of ice cream containers with a matching cover."
31080,She also made us matching dresses for my sister and I and our doll.
31081,Loved them.
31082,I still have my dolls dress.

31089,Heading there to order a couple of cats!!!
31090,😺😺
31091,"Idk if you ever thought of selling them, because I'm sure they're tons of work, but this is honestly something I would buy for myself, my nieces and nephews, etc."
31092,"It's beautiful, peaceful, and made with such love :)"
31093,Thank you so much!

31115,My quilt was something I begged my mom for many years for.
31116,"I knew it was a huge ask, as her career keeps her busy, and I have loved it to the moon and back since I received it."
31117,"It’s my blankey, my comfy spot, a slice of happiness I can wrap myself in."
31118,Handmade gifts are truly the best.
31119,"They did, and now they want to make their own!"
31120,so I'm gonna teach them how to sew :D
31121,You should!
31122,it's so fun and good for the soul!
31123,Great way to reuse as well.
31124,The machine does the hardest part!
31125,"Having a nice simple pattern helps a lot, I plan on making an easy to follow tutorial soon"

31127,It looks great!
31128,It really is awesome.
31129,Have you considered starting an Etsy page and selling there?

31187,"🤩 I was getting ready for dinner once, doing my hair and makeup, and my 4 year old godson was there just hanging out with me playing on the floor."
31188,"When I was finished, I said “how do I look?"
31189,!” And he looked at me and said “happy.” You look beautiful; even more-so because you also look super happy.
31190,You look incredible!
31191,You rock that dress and look absolutely beautiful.
31192,Your inner you shines through and you look happy.
31193,I hope you get to enjoy that happiness and have a wonderful night dear!
31194,"I’m a trans person, I’ve been in the queer community for over 10 years now so I’d like to think I have a good “trans-dar” and I can honestly say I don’t think you have anything to worry about going out dressed like this."
31195,You “pass” extremely well and look absolutely gorgeous!
31196,Ps.
31197,"Normally I wouldn’t bring up “passing” or tell someone “I couldn’t even tell” those comments can be taken offensively to trans people, I only said them in this context because OP is worried about their appearance and the potential of going out presenting differently than they usually do."
31198,I say them as a reassurance in this context but I wanted to clarify so that well-meaning cis people understand that you generally shouldn’t say those things to trans folks.
31199,"Hey kiddo,

I honestly don't know what you're worried about, unless it's that you look too much like your old mom."
31200,"I mean, I get it, you don't wanna look like me, you wanna be your own person, cool, I respect that, you do you."
31201,But you totally look just like me when I was younger and more daring... Just sayin.
31202,"Love,
Mom

PS."
31203,"How much will you hate me if I randomly show up in the front row of your show and scream ""that's my baby!!!"""
31204,at a volume that literally everyone within 5 blocks will hear?
31205,"Cause that's pretty much already planned and happening, so I hope you won't hate me too much... Just sayin."
31206,Your make up and hair are *mwoah* chefs kiss!
31207,I have shown this picture to my eye brows with the note that I would very much appreciate it if they could be on point like yours haha!
31208,"You have s beautiful smile, never lose that."
31209,You are beaming.
31210,❤️
31211,"Damn, I have seen that dress before and always loved it."
31212,"If I could look even 1/10th as fabulous in it as you do, I would be forever happy!"
31213,"You rock it, babe!"
31214,You look amazing and your smile is absolutely radiant!
31215,I hope you have a great time.
31216,Duckling you look good!

31235,You look absolutely fabulous!!
31236,Also if you hadn’t blatantly said you were a cross dresser I would’ve never noticed.

31253,You pass.
31254,Just remember that.
31255,"If someone is looking at you and you feel uncomfortable, that's just your dysphoria."
31256,"Accept that you're feeling dysphoric, remember the people looking at you are thinking whatever you want them to think."
31257,"If you think you're a fraud, then you'll think they think you're a fraud."
31258,"If you think you're fierce, then you'll think they're thinking how fierce you are."
31259,Maybe some people are looking at you positively.
31260,Maybe some are looking at you negatively.
31261,"Either way, until you feel confident and aren't dysphoric, does it really matter?"
31262,No.
31263,It will matter later when you've gotten comfortable being the authentic you.
31264,Wow!!!!!
31265,You are gorgeous!!!
31266,Enjoy yourself.
31267,You deserve this happiness.

31989,"I’m not sure if you’d looking for any feedback, but I think you look great."
31990,The dress fits you well and your makeup looks beautiful—especially the lip color.
31991,My only criticism (I hope constructive) is that I’m not sure styling your hair that way suits your face.
31992,"Maybe a slightly shorter cut, like just above your shoulders?"
31993,Just an opinion.
31994,Keep that bright smile and you will beam confidence wherever you go sis!

32004,I only saw the dress first and thought (again) that I should get on with my diet so I could wear a dress like that again.
32005,I never even considered you weren’t female.
32006,"And just in case that is offensive in some way I’m sorry, it’s really not meant that way."
32007,(Danish and I sometimes end on eggshells writing here).
32008,Gorgeous
32009,You look so beautiful!!!

32032,"I mean, the shoes terrify me, and I couldn’t walk five steps in them without falling over."
32033,"But they totally suit that dress, and you are radiating confidence and happiness, so I suggest you go out there and rock them both!"
32034,You.

32099,You're beautiful.
32100,I'm insanely jealous of your calves!
32101,The dress is gorgeous!
32102,I don't think you have any reason to chicken out.

32172,You are so pretty and just remember confidence is one of the sexiest personality traits.

32218,**big mom hugs**
32219,Gorgeous
32220,You look great!
32221,I initially thought you were just showing off your dress!
32222,You could get some press on nails with either an almond or stiletto shape to make your fingers/hands look more slender.
32223,If you wanted to add a little more force to your waist you could use some light shapewear (you don't have to go as far as a corset).
32224,To be honest though all of these are just extra touches that you can do *if* you want to.
32225,You look great as-is!
32226,Oh honey you are just absolutely beautiful
32227,Absolutely gorgeous
32228,You look radiant!!!
32229,Have a wonderful time!!

32238,"You are so beautiful, amazing hair and amazing smile!"
32239,You look amazing!
32240,And you don't need to shave.
32241,I rarely shave my legs as a woman.
32242,It doesn't make you any less feminine.
32243,"If you want to then go for it, but it's not needed 🫀"
32244,Your smile and your dress look amazing!!
32245,You look so happy and beautiful.
32246,❤️
32247,Your dress is so pretty and sparkly!
32248,I’m AFAB NB.

32261,Gorgeous and refined!
32262,"My girl, you look stunning and are absolutely killing it in that black dress."
32263,It would be a shame to get all dolled up and not go out.
32264,Have a great time!
32265,You look radiant!
32266,"And I’m sure you already know, but you don’t have to shave if you don’t want to."
32267,"I support your choice to do so, I just get so darn itchy personally and can’t stand it."
32268,"I wouldn’t have even noticed if you didn’t mention it, it took me 10 years to realize no one ever brought up the fact that I don’t shave."
32269,You look amazing for everything you are doing and not doing sis ❤️
32270,"You look so happy, you’re glowing!"
32271,"Btw,is your dress a Tadashi Shoji?"
32272,Looks great!
32273,You look great.
32274,"My only advice would be the shoes- a- they look like your feet are going to hurt a lot, and -b- they are not making your toes look pretty."
32275,I would recommend a closed toe shoe.
32276,Open toe shoes are hard for everyone because you need to find a pair that match up perfectly with the shape of your toes for them to look nice (and everyone’s toes are differently shaped.)
32277,I would suggest a fun nail polish on hands and feet to complete the look :)
32278,"Hey Sweets, you look radiant."
32279,🥰 You are beautiful and your smile says that you *feel* beautiful too.
32280,I hope you have a wonderful night out and feel so comfortable in this “new you”.
32281,"If anyone even starts to give you any trouble, you lock eyes with them and own your confidence."
32282,"Be proud to be you, hon."
32283,You got this!
32284,"Love, Mom"

32375,You look gorgeous!
32376,Not a clue you were cross dressing.
32377,Have fun!
32378,You pull it off great.
32379,If you don't want your legs exposed you could always wear tights.
32380,I love it!
32381,"I also wanna know where that dress is from, I feel like it would suit me just as much as it does you!"
32382,"Also, don’t feel as though you have to shave your legs unless you want to, though I understand that for your safety you may feel you have to to “blend in,” but shaved legs aren’t a requirement for a bad ass dress!"
32383,"You look fab and I can see the joy in your face, which is always the best accessory♥️♥️♥️"
32384,That dress is stunning on you!
32385,I love your curled hair too!
32386,Go out and stunt on the world.
32387,Anyone who has time to give you a dirty look or criticize you is a miserable person.
32388,No one happy sees someone else living their best life and tries to tear them down.
32389,Unless your best life is being a mass murderer.
32390,Lol
32391,You look beautiful!
32392,And honestly if you don't want to bother with shaving then you can also get some opaque tights (if that won't make you too hot)
32393,You look absolutely gorgeous my sissy :)
32394,Came here to say this.
32395,Sis you look happy and radiant!
32396,"I love the outfit, especially those heels."
32397,Personally I dont really shave lol so dont you dare apologize for it!
32398,Awww I love this story so much ❤️
32399,My first thought was how happy OP looked!
32400,Has a glow :)
32401,Thank you for this clarification.
32402,"I'm a cis bi female and always want to be supportive of the community, so it's good to know this so I don't accidentally insult or hurt someone."
32403,"I'm usually quite impressed because a lot of Trans women look way more feminine and beautiful than me, but I will try to express that in a more appropriate way."
32404,"Also...the OP said they were ""crossdressing"" which may be part of a transformation on the journey towards being transgender but isn't always."
32405,"We only have what they're presenting to go off of, which it why I made the separate comment I did initially as well."
32406,trans masc person here!
32407,i agree with your statement.
32408,"was trying to word it without being offensive but they do look stunning and ""pass"" so well."
32409,i had to read the post title more than once!
32410,I didn't know that that was offensive.
32411,Can I ask why?
32412,Awww I love this comment so much!
32413,Thank you
32414,What a lovely mum.
32415,♥️
32416,Can I please get an internet hug from you?
32417,"Also, lemme know how you did in those shoes, my feet are hurting just looking at them 😂"
32418,"I love that, ""I already won."""
32419,That's brilliant.
32420,"Going to tuck that in my back pocket, and leave the wish that we could all get a little of that in our lives!"
32421,Aww thank you!
32422,I’ve never gotten a pedicure but that sounds lovely 🥰
32423,Same here.
32424,"I was scrolling through my homepage and thought “huh, whys there a lady in a dress on my feed?“ then read the title lol"
32425,Awww thank you.
32426,My brain does the same when I get time to present this way!
32427,Ahhh I’ve never been to Vegas!
32428,Sounds so fun to go with a sister❤️
32429,Amazon actually lol and thank you so much.
32430,"Ooops, I guess I forgot to add it in the title, I’ll be going out for new years and was trying to find the perfect outfit."
32431,So future tense 😀
32432,I have a lot of time to make up for 😀 Pretty much all I wear when I’m not in public lol
32433,"I have been wearing them in my house every night to cook, hang out, pretty much everything lol."
32434,I’ve been practice my butt off so I’m ready to wear them out on NYE 😀
32435,Ooops I forgot got mention in the title that I will be going out NYE for the first time.
32436,Just was looking for the perfect outfit
32437,Aww I love her!
32438,Thank you so much!
32439,Awww thank you so much 😀
32440,Awww thank you!
32441,Always wanted a sister but had 3 brothers instead lol
32442,I am so excited to have smooth legs and put this dress on ☺️
32443,Awww thank you!
32444,She’s so pretty!
32445,"I actually am preparing for NYE, should’ve mentioned that in the title."
32446,I have not gone out yet but will post and update when I do 😀
32447,Amazon actually 😀
32448,"Aww thank you, my voice 100% gives it away so you would know as soon as the conversation started haha"
32449,"Aww thank you, I’ve added these to a playlist 🥰"
32450,"I do live most of my life presenting male, when presenting this way I do prefer female pronouns, but I am not offended."
32451,If you were referring to a transwoman it would be a rude thing to say however so I would always proceed on the side of caution
32452,What color tights?
32453,Nude or black?
32454,I also have some patterned black ones that are cute
32455,"Ahhh I’ve only heard stories about compliments from the ladies bathroom, never experienced it haha I am excited to send some compliments out as well 😊"
32456,"Haha oh yea, I’ve been practicing that very walk"
32457,Haha what state did you go to high school in?
32458,Why what?
32459,You're gorgeous too
32460,Hi!
32461,Also a woman of trans experience!
32462,"The tricky thing when it comes to complimenting someone that's trans by saying stuff like:
-I couldn't even tell you were trans!"
32463,-you look better in a dress than *I* do!
32464,-how are you more feminine than me?
32465,Is that those all have a hidden bias behind them that implies that cis is better than trans.
32466,-I couldn't even tell you were trans!
32467,"Also says ""if I could tell, that would be worse."""
32468,-you look better in a dress than *I* do!
32469,"Also says ""you're not *supposed* to."
32470,"Because you're trans."""
32471,-how are you more feminine than me?
32472,"Also says ""I expect y'all to be Mannish brutes."""
32473,"Now most of us understand that these things aren't said with the intention of hurting us, but still, that unspoken thing lingers a lot longer than the compliment does."
32474,It's just a reflection of the unspoken bias that people still have against us even while supporting us.
32475,"We're still viewed as lesser, just constantly trying to achieve the ""cisness"" we can never have."
32476,"It's much easier to just, like, *compliment us*."
32477,Like any other woman.
32478,Our shoes or our nails or our eye makeup or whatever.
32479,"You don't need to make your compliments about how well we're pulling off ""woman""."
32480,Because we just *are* women.
32481,If someone is asking about it it’s not rude but otherwise it can be :)
32482,"Yes, cross dressing and being trans are wholly different, yet all kinds of trans folks commenting here and getting offended."
32483,Come back and read the more recent comments ITT.
32484,Really well explained.
32485,A lot of people cannot pass or do not want to pass.
32486,They're happy being trans.
32487,We should respect everybody's identity whether they pass or not is the idea.
32488,"Because it’s about being true to themselves, not just fitting to society’s standards of what a certain gender should look like."
32489,Same way I don’t encourage cis-men to hold their feelings  or cis-women to wear make up.
32490,We should all be ourselves and be how we feel happier.
32491,"Of course you can, sweetie!"
32492,All the internet mama bear hugs in the world!
32493,🤗
32494,My first thought!!!
32495,OP be sure to spread out use of heels!!!
32496,You can actually develop shortened Achilles tendons over time with chronic heel wearing!!!!
32497,That shit hurts.
32498,But damn you look great!!
32499,!
32500,Ah I see!
32501,Well I think it’s the perfect outfit for New Years!
32502,And I hope you have fun!
32503,"That's good to hear, my darling!"
32504,I just don't want you to have to spend 3 months or so on crutches and 6 mths or so in PT!
32505,Aww!
32506,That's alright.
32507,You could rock a Juliette Lewis vibe.
32508,"She's got a deep voice, she's fab af, and you look like you could be her little sister."
32509,"Any would work well, I'm leaning nude."
32510,"But if you already have black ones, use those!"
32511,😊
32512,"Let me readdress this properly, I didn’t realize I was in MomForAMinute."
32513,"🥰

Baby, you did an EXCELLENT job picking a dress!"
32514,"It’s a perfect fit and I can see you radiating CON👏FI👏DENCE👏 

I am so proud of you and your journey."
32515,It has taken you so much to get here and I am honored you have chosen to share this with ME!
32516,Any nervous jitters you feel are just like my mama always told me: those jitters are just butterflies in their cocoons getting ready to take flight!
32517,"Be sure to take your phone, your lipstick, some bandaids for hotspots in your shoes… and a tampon in your purse."
32518,"(It’s a really nice way to be able to support each other in the bathroom, and pretty much a rite of passage to be on either end of the much needed exchange.)"
32519,"Have so much fun and when you get home, if you feel like it, please pop in and tell us all about your event!"
32520,🥰🥰🥰
32521,Arizona
32522,Why dress like a woman when your a male?
32523,"So this is not the same thing obviously, but it makes a lot of sense to me because it would always hurt my feelings when people said, ""you look so great for a mom of 4!"""
32524,"Like the alternative way to say that is ""I expected you to look like shit!"""
32525,"Or ""you look so great for a monster!"""
32526,Compliments with qualifiers just sort of feel like shit.
32527,Thank you so much for explaining this so plainly.
32528,"I’m often one that sticks her foot in her mouth, but I never mean any harm."
32529,Your reason why not to say these things makes perfect sense and I believe will help me become a better ally.
32530,"Also there's the element of us women (or people, in general) complimenting others by putting themselves down."
32531,"It's unhealthy, and the patriarchy uses this subtle competition over appearance to exert control over us, and to maintain the status quo."
32532,"OP can be beautiful without me having to be unattractive (or unfeminine, or whatever)."
32533,"It's honestly something I am trying to get better about myself, because my first impulse was to feel bad about myself compared to their radiance, and I had to remind myself that my appearance isn't relative or dependent on another person's."
32534,This is why I stick with generalized compliments such as “you look amazing!” or “I love your hair / makeup / outfit!” If I think they look nice.
32535,"If I’m specifically asked, I’ll give a deeper opinion, but ONLY if I’m asked."
32536,Jumping in with the other side of the coin.
32537,I am a trans man.
32538,"The best compliment I've ever had was the guy at Dunkin' saying at the end of my transaction, ""You're all set, buddy."""
32539,I about hit the moon on the inside.
32540,"That being said, I would also appreciate being told I pass, even if it is an implication that not passing would be worse."
32541,"I think of it as more like someone saying, ""You know that thing you're trying to look like?"
32542,You look like that.
32543,"Good job."""
32544,"Though, on the other hand, hearing ""hey bro, you pass"" outta the blue would probably make me feel both happy and sad at once, as it means they think i look masculine but could tell I'm not, if that makes any sense?"
32545,Aaaand now editing my comment thank you for making me aware!
32546,"Shit, thanks for this explanation, I've been trying to be a good ally since I left my religious/conservative roots several years back."
32547,"Since I don't really make friends, I haven't been around basically any trans people and was under the impression that saying they pass was a compliment."
32548,Thank you for spreading awareness to the ignorant like myself.
32549,I tell my cousin she looks happy.
32550,Thanks for bringing this to my attention though.
32551,"I know I've thought these things, without any ill wishes of course."
32552,"Thank you do much, I've felt I've learnt a lot from this and you've helped prevent me say the wrong thing."
32553,Thats how people talk to women.
32554,"If not trans compared to siblings, friends, younger self… just saddly is."
32555,Thank you so much for this.
32556,I understand you didn’t have to take the time to explain.
32557,I have a trans daughter and I think the hardest part is knowing what to say or how to say it.
32558,Im always so scared of saying anything that doesn’t express 100% support that often times I feel like I don’t say enough because of that fear.
32559,It helps tremendously to have read it explained this way!
32560,Wow.
32561,"You have just taught me so much, thank you!"
32562,I always want to do better.
32563,This message is a public service.
32564,❤️ Thank you for taking the time to explain & to educate.
32565,It is so important that people understand these assumptions.
32566,"This is a really educational comment, one I will implement and take forward in life."
32567,So thank you!
32568,To piggyback on this.
32569,I have stopped telling people they look great after a noticeable weight loss.
32570,It tells them they didn’t look great before and that I judge them on their appearance.
32571,"I don't have any awards, but I can offer you a firm handshake."
32572,Very well said.
32573,Ty for articulating this.
32574,100.
32575,Well said!
32576,Thank you for this.
32577,I don’t really know if I’ve ever said anything like this or not.
32578,But I would have never thought about the implications of how I word what I want to come across as a compliment.
32579,"I will be more mindful of how I compliment someone’s appearance, trans or not."
32580,"Thank you again for the education, and helping me grow as a person."
32581,So well said.
32582,A beautifully worded post.
32583,"Based of the original post of the OP, we don't know if they are trans though because they used the word ""crossdressing"" which implies they are doing something that isn't reflective of their original gender identity."
32584,What is the difference?
32585,I want to know without coming off as rude.
32586,Does cross dressing mean a male still identifies as male but just likes to dress feminine?
32587,And then transgender is when they actually identify as a different gender and dress according to the one they identify with?
32588,Did I get that right?
32589,Makes sense.
32590,Thanks
32591,That makes sense.
32592,Thank you
32593,Because it makes me feel good and happy and confident.
32594,I love women’s fashion and makeup and get really excited when I get a chance to dress this way
32595,You've given me something to think about when complimenting someone:  Compliments without qualifiers.
32596,"So basic, but I've never really thought about it before."
32597,"My daughter has Down Syndrome and people say, ""I can't even tell!"""
32598,It's really hurtful because the implication is that having features of DS is a bad thing.
32599,You have such a pretty face!
32600,Same with “you look so great for your age!” = “old women are supposed to be ugly!”
32601,"So two years ago I was in a pretty tough spot in life, I won’t get into it but I wasn’t great."
32602,"Then I got pregnant, and my parents were…let’s say less than supportive and less than thrilled."
32603,"I completely cleaned up the moment I found out I was pregnant, but my parents still made my entire pregnancy miserable with their behavior."
32604,My daughter will be a year old a week from tomorrow and she is my world.
32605,"She has only been out of my direct care for like 6 hours total her entire life, and even then she was with my fiancé (her dad)."
32606,I am a fantastic mom.
32607,"A few weeks ago I was visiting my parents and my dad said to me “you know, I’ve been wanting to say this to you, you’re doing a lot better than I thought you would.” I straight up looked at him and was like “that isn’t *nearly* the compliment you think it is."
32608,"In fact, I would MUCH rather you have just kept that to yourself.” What he heard was “you’re a good mom”."
32609,"What I heard was “man, I really thought you were gonna be the shittiest mother in the world (and spent 8 months all but telling you so) but I guess you really aren’t that bad!” So yea, not a compliment and I really do wish he would have just kept that to himself."
32610,"Anyway, OP you look AMAZING!"
32611,Those legs!
32612,(Imagine me putting in like 10 alternating heart & star eye emojis here.)
32613,"And I lovvvvve peep toes, they’re my favorite shoes to wear!"
32614,And that dress is sexy af!
32615,I love it all!
32616,You’re beautiful and you look so happy and I’m so happy for you!
32617,Unlike most people if I told some one “you look good for a mom a 4!” Its bc you look better then I do and you’ve been chasing 4 other people while you did it.
32618,If I was chasing 4 kids around I’d probably look like I just stuck a fork in the socket.
32619,I can barely mange my two nieces with out looking like a dirtbag.
32620,Exactly!
32621,You're so well groomed for a straight guy.
32622,You look great for 40!
32623,"For a mum with three kids, you look amazing!"
32624,"It's not intended to, but comes across as backhanded compliments."
32625,I second the thank you.
32626,It answered questions I didn’t know I had.
32627,THIS!
32628,So much this.
32629,We are trained to believe beauty is zero sum.
32630,"We are taught to see other women as competition, and to see transwomen as “not women” so that we divide ourselves instead of having a big powerful community that challenges the status quo."
32631,I recommend this experiment: don’t say anything negative about yourself AT ALL to anyone for a whole day.
32632,"It is way harder than it sounds, and made me so aware of this tendency."
32633,"""You're all set, buddy."""
32634,"My goodness, the euphoria that comes with even a vaguely gendered term, right?"
32635,"Apologies to the non binary folk that get saddled with a false binary, but there's something so amazing about an unprompted ""this way, ladies"" at a restaurant that sends me."
32636,">That being said, I would also appreciate being told I pass, even if it is an implication that not passing would be worse."
32637,"There's a lot of trans folk that do appreciate it, and in the times that someone hasn't clocked me, or has expressed shock when learning I'm trans, I admit it can feel good."
32638,"I DO think, though, that's its an unhealthy goal for trans folk to aspire to, personal safety notwithstanding."
32639,"It's like self identifying as less valid, for one, and it's also both subjective based on someone else's standards, and simply unattainable for some."
32640,"The presumed inability to pass has caused so much pain to so many trans siblings, and I wish we all didn't feel forced into a cis standard of acceptable features."
32641,">feel both happy and sad at once, as it means they think i look masculine but could tell I'm not, if that makes any sense?"
32642,"That's the crux right there, right?"
32643,"If passing is the goal, you either constantly get hints that you're failing, or you have to out yourself repeatedly to confirm."
32644,"And if you DO pass, then you're just in another closet where you have to continuously lie about who you are/how you got to where you are."
32645,I too was raised extremely conservative and in what I now know to be a religious cult.
32646,My motto is always “we don’t know until we know” because even as a trans person myself I didn’t know any of this until it applied to my life and I learned it.
32647,There’s a huge difference between willful ignorance/purposely being harmful and just not knowing.
32648,Always keep learning to be a better ally but don’t shame yourself for not knowing something you’ve never had the opportunity to learn yet.
32649,Thank you for doing what you can to support your daughter!
32650,"If I had one piece of advice for parents that are trying to be supportive but struggle, it's this: don't let your fear dictate how you support them, because it will show through."
32651,"They aren't afraid of being trans: rather, they're ecstatic at the possibility of an authentic life."
32652,What they're scared of is the societal aversion to trans folk (especially these days).
32653,"If you show them fear at who they are, rather than excitement at their joy, then you're proving their fear correct."
32654,"Embrace her womanhood, include her in yours."
32655,Celebrate her truth.
32656,"She's got the capacity to be happier than you've ever imagined, but she needs to *feel* that you want that for her."
32657,"Keep at it, Mom."
32658,You've got this.
32659,Edit: a word
32660,Absolutely.
32661,"My response was based on the person above me, who was reflecting on something another trans person said to OP."
32662,OP is valid no matter where their journey takes them.
32663,No implication meant from me that there's a gender incongruence.
32664,Sometimes a dress is too gorgeous not to wear.
32665,The difference for me is that I identify as male and live as male currently.
32666,"Crossdressing is temporary where at the end of the day, the makeup and clothes come off and I go back to identifying as male."
32667,Now transgender is an umbrella term which doesn’t technically mean that someone is transitioning.
32668,"For me personally, I am considering transition and the best way for me to explore that is to present this way and see how it make me feel."
32669,Most people associate the term transgender with people who do transition however and that would be the difference
32670,That's how I understand it.
32671,Indeed you did.
32672,Those are the definitions.
32673,There are more nuances as well.
32674,Happy to help.
32675,It’s been journey for me to learn to be an ally.
32676,And there’s still so much more to learn 😅
32677,"""Compliments without qualifiers"" is it in a nutshell."
32678,Defintiely remembering this for the future!
32679,Right?
32680,The OC said some things that seem so obvious after having read them.
32681,"The first time my friend came out as trans and went out the first time as their identifying gender, everyone said “wow."
32682,You look fantastic/amazing/gorgeous/sexy.” That’s it.
32683,It was fucking amazing to see.
32684,I’m cis-het-F.
32685,But I’m a huge part of my queer community because of my bestie.
32686,"I love all the hims, thems, fems, and either or neither of all the people in that group."
32687,Kings and queens included.
32688,"That one has had the qualifier so long, it doesn't even need spoken."
32689,Or maybe I'm genuinely just triggered by it.
32690,Right?
32691,"And it always comes with looking me up and down too as if to silently say ""moms are totally supposed to be fat"" and the other unsaid part of that is ""if you were any fatter you wouldn't look as good."""
32692,It's just such layered bullshit.
32693,People can just be beautiful.
32694,"It's just not cool to be like ""you look so good for being... you know...."
32695,"you."""
32696,And OP if you see this you look damn fine and I hope you feel as fantastic as you look!
32697,It’s not that I expect one to look like crap; it’s the fact that you can juggle all that and make it look good and easy.
32698,"I don't consider it lying that I once looked one way, and now I am something else."
32699,Is it lying to gain a title?
32700,"I'm not being flippant, just musing, I suppose."
32701,Does it feel good to gain your doctorate and become Doctor Soandso?
32702,You've changed how people should refer to you.
32703,Like becoming a Lord or something.
32704,"But this is more humble, like just shifting between equally valid baskets."
32705,"I bet the nonbinaries have their favorite terms to be addressed as, and are just as over the moon as we are when they hear them too."
32706,Their struggle is tough because most people don't know their terms of address at all.
32707,"Hmm, all this to say, I feel like my body was a lie before."
32708,"And now, the true man, the truth, is free?"
32709,This is such a beautiful comment; cutting some onions up in here.
32710,"Just to add 2 cents: u/analystnerd, please remember that the goal isn’t for you to say everything perfectly; the goal is to have a relationship where your daughter feels safe enough to give you feedback on your words/actions, and believes that you will proactively take on board her feedback."
32711,"This is a huge, huge skill for people to learn — how to say “this hurt me because X; please do Y next time.” Aim for creating time & space for those dialogues & that level of trust."
32712,"It will help her see what healthy relationships should look like, and help her practice advocating for herself in her intimate relationships down the road."
32713,Dangit this hit my heart so hard.
32714,Thank you for the advice and encouragement.
32715,"Yes, she always looks so happy when I go with her to buy nail polish or when I cut her growing hair into a cute layered style so it looks good while growing out."
32716,"I still feel like I’m messing up somehow but you’re right, it’s just the fear of society."
32717,But she doesn’t care when I’m with her and excited with her.
32718,I never realized that was what she needs to most.
32719,"Seriously, thank you both!"
32720,This comment had me bawling.
32721,Agreed.
32722,Crossdressing is a fetish one engages in for sexual expression and enjoyment and typically is separate from gender identity.
32723,I've been close with many crossdressers and it's been fun to help them make the transformation in private without the burden of PC social constraints honestly.
32724,"As someone on the Autistic Spectrum, respecting the rights and feelings of everyone (not just the LGBT+ community) can be a lot to deal with on top of the other things that make me socially awkward, always having to check in and be sure I am aware of, reading, respecting and affirming other's choices, beliefs and identities (we all have many identities in many areas of our lives)."
32725,It can be exhausting to be social.
32726,"This makes me relate to my crossdressing friends in a foundational manner because they are risking a lot to put on a ""face"" and as an Aspie, we often also must mask to fit in and scan people's faces to measure their reactions to know how to respond to everything and so every choice is fraught with uncertainty."
32727,"I wish the potential consequences weren't such a great risk, otherwise I might view it as exciting rather than anxiety producing."
32728,Excellent breakdown.
32729,Non-binary people CAN be transgender but aren't necessarily and vice versa.
32730,Crossdressing CAN be a vehicle on the way to the journey of a transition but it doesn't have to be.
32731,Gender identity is a whole other topic as is attraction.
32732,Are you attracted?
32733,To males/females or...?
32734,"You're super attractive, but I'm sure you know that."
32735,"I am attracted to people, not parts."
32736,You look gorgeous!
32737,Thank you for the explanation!
32738,You look beautiful and I wish you the best with whatever journey you decide on!
32739,🙂
32740,"Yep, so obvious that I feel so stupid for not recognizing it on my own."
32741,I love this story!
32742,So pleased your friend has the support they deserve.
32743,Oh I know I am!
32744,100% on all these things!
32745,I get what you’re saying.
32746,"Then I think the compliment should be something like “Damn, you make momming look easy, and I know it’s not.”"
32747,"100% this, yes!"
32748,Congratulations!!!
32749,"So proud of you

(Also, I don't mean to alarm you, but it looks like you've got some floofy toe beans on you...)"
32750,Congratulations Kaya Jean!
32751,"When my daughter changed her name, she also chose Jean as a middle name."
32752,"I was really honored because that's my middle name that we would have given her 

Our judge was really sweet and told us he loved name changes since everyone walks away happy."
32753,"He called it happy law 

It's wonderful getting a new name that fits perfectly."
32754,So happy for you!
32755,Congratulations!
32756,I am so proud of you!

32931,Daring to be true to yourself?
32932,Yet you went through all these hoops because you rejected who you were.

32945,"Congrats, sister!"
32946,"💙🤍💗

Also, love the hair color 🥰"
32947,Kaya Jean suits you!
32948,You look gorgeous and happy.
32949,Hi Kaya!
32950,Agreed!
32951,"(Also, is there actually a universe where floofy toe beans are alarming?"
32952,"If so, that's honestly kind of heartbreaking.)"
32953,This is really nice to hear.
32954,"I picked Kay because it was my mom's middle name and the name she would have given me, which I thought was a sweet gesture (despite how my parents are very religious conservatives) but my mom was just mad I was changing it at all."
32955,"And yeah, my judge was really nice too!"
32956,"As a trans person, I always feel like I have to go to new places with my guard up, and it was SUCH a nice surprise that he seemed real happy for me."
32957,Thank you!
32958,<3
32959,"I don't mean to sound ignorant, but hearing?"
32960,"Hell yeah, do you got a name picked out already?"
32961,My partner was going to do it with me (the trans foundation in our town paid for us) but it was months ago that we started the process and they still haven't settled on one lol.
32962,"not even kidding tho, I got another cat (not her, I've had her for a while and she's my best buddy) as a surprise gift like three weeks ago."
32963,I am officially cat lady.
32964,"god, a new drivers license with a hopefully better picture alone will be worth it"
32965,I'm trying!
32966,"Got sober over the last couple of years (I was burying a lot of depression in pretending to have fun while drinking a lot), started therapy, got on antidepressants, and I think I'm like ... feeling alive for the first time in years."
32967,thanks!
32968,I did it straight out of a box!
32969,<3
32970,thank you so much.
32971,it's always been so important to me since I was little to have like ... my outward self as aligned with my inward self as possible.
32972,"And this was the one big thing I wasn't up front about with the world, and it feels so good finally have accepted it."
32973,Thanks!
32974,I'll go join right now.
32975,I can always use more of this in my life.
32976,"yeah, she had to fight to get on camera too!"
32977,"(it was a video call) She doesn't let me do anything without her, we're thick as thieves."
32978,Been through a lot together.
32979,are you getting the name change anytime soon?
32980,it was actually much easier than I expected (although I did have my city's trans foundation guiding me through it).
32981,Super fast too!
32982,But now I got a lot of phone calls to make to update my name.
32983,I'm a girl <3 And thanks!
32984,"It's a family middle name, and the one member of my blood family I have contact with is my cousin named Lindsey Jeane."
32985,"She went out of her way to look after me when I got sick, my immediate family left, and I was in a bad way."
32986,It just seemed fitting!
32987,Like Gaia with a K!
32988,I really liked the way it flowed when paired with Jean.
32989,she's the sweetest goddamn little bug on the planet.
32990,"her name is Dr. Mrs. Zophia ""Zamboni"" Babadook-Galactica Bella Ciao Cattingtonbear, Attorney at Law!"
32991,"In person, I always take a deep breath before saying her name -- Dr. Mrs. Zophia ""Zamboni"" Babadook-Galactica Bella Ciao Cattingtonbear, Attorney at Law."
32992,But just Zamboni for short.
32993,this made me feel real nice.
32994,"It's been a process, learning to do makeup the way I want (I have hand tremors, so it's tough sometimes) but I'm getting better."
32995,Drawing lessons as a kid helped.
32996,"Plus, I never left my emo phase so style is real easy <3"
32997,its just ... so much practice.
32998,"If you ever have any questions, I can try to help!"
32999,Just shoot me a message!
33000,this is the mommest comment on this thread!
33001,"and that might be right, but I also publicly write for a lot of publications and play in a band that's been in a few commercials."
33002,"So I figure my name's out there no matter what, I might as well just embrace it."
33003,Is that stupid?
33004,"Okay, so the kitty is named \*deep breath\* Dr. Mrs. Zophia ""Zamboni"" Babadook-Galactica Bella Ciao Cattingtonbear, Attorney at Law."
33005,But we just call her Zamboni for short.
33006,"Reading this comment, I felt compelled to tell you that I’m proud of you for shedding something that doesn’t represent the person you are or want to be."
33007,It’s always been interesting that they call it a “family name” when those that are attached to it can be harmful.
33008,I hope your day in court is everything you want it to be.
33009,When we changed my son’s name it felt magical to free him from the line he towed by carrying that name.
33010,I hope your cut to your line is nothing less than empowering.
33011,❤️
33012,Maybe unexpected 3am floofy toe beans?
33013,Or toe beans with very sharp death blades.
33014,Im assuming for their name change.
33015,"You appear in front of a judge, they ask why you're changing your name(you just say personal reasons) and asks if you are avoiding any financial debts and then they approve the name change and then you can go file your paperwork to finalize it all."
33016,"Yeah I'm changing my legal name to Gloria, I am transgender"
33017,Yeah I  am Gloria
33018,That’s how it begins.
33019,I started out with two cats and now have six.
33020,"If we’re being honest though, being a cat lady is fantastic."
33021,"Congrats on the new beautiful name little sister, I’m so proud of you for being true to yourself!"
33022,That’s a lot of work.
33023,I’m proud of you.
33024,Aww 🥰 Kaya you are your own success story!
33025,:-)
33026,"I don't have any actual plans unfortunately 

But I've started to get the fear of dying and being buried under the wrong name, that a huge modification for actually getting it done"
33027,I'm so happy!!!
33028,It fits you wonderfully ❤️❤️❤️
33029,Aww
33030,"Dr. Zamboni is adorable and so are you, Sweetheart!"
33031,Love you and sending big mama hugs--Mama Dani
33032,*esquire!
33033,!
33034,Wow.
33035,"I can see she's a cute, good kitty but evidently she must be very smart too to have a doctorate and to have passed the bar exam."
33036,You must be so proud of her.
33037,What a good girl.
33038,Thank you kind stranger!
33039,💕
33040,"Actually, yeah, those would be alarming."
33041,"Well then, I partially retract my statement!"
33042,"Elon Musk's kid in ~16 years:

Judge: ""Why do you want to change your name?"""
33043,"*flat look from XÆ A-12*

Edit: but for real, I'm happy for y'all!"
33044,Congrats!
33045,Thank you!
33046,“Avoiding personal debts” por que no los dos?
33047,Congratulations!
33048,Congrats!
33049,Congratulations & that's a beautiful name.
33050,I like that name.
33051,"A sis named Gloria, sounds great."
33052,I like your username even more
33053,"Welcome darling, your name is truly you."
33054,"Our glorious baby, all grown up :-)"
33055,"It’s so odd that with all the apparent freedoms offered by the US you have to get approval from a court, in person, to change your own name?"
33056,Weird.
33057,Congratulations!
33058,Gloria is a beautiful name :)
33059,I'm close to someone named Gloria and she was lamenting the fact that she's never met another Gloria before in her life.
33060,I'm thrilled to be able to tell her that I've met another Gloria!
33061,❤️
33062,That kid will have the paperwork filled out long before they can file it.
33063,Well unless thet find out they can be emancipated  then they might go for that & change their name to an actual name sooner.
33064,Reasons the name their parents gave them & the reasons they give for it.
33065,Use their allowance for legal costs & get some compensation off of daddy due to that name choice.
33066,You're welcome :)
33067,Both of what?
33068,You’re not allowed to change your name if you have debt.
33069,Thanks!
33070,I'm excited
33071,Thank you.
33072,I've only been out since the end of May
33073,Thanks it's been a ride!
33074,"Thanks, I picked them both myself"
33075,Socially you can go by whatever you like...for legal documents I understand the extra effort.
33076,Thank you 🥰
33077,It's cute that we want to believe the best in XÆ A-12.
33078,He very well could also end up just another rich white boy though.
33079,"I feel like it'll really help with confidence, it's not ""my name is [deadname] but I'd prefer to be called Gloria"" It's "" I am Gloria"""
33080,Probably will but even then he'll still want to have an actual name that doesn't make him cringe.
33081,100% worth the effort!
33082,I am so happy for you!
33083,I still look 95% like a man in the face but i have developed a fairly feminine body so it's  kinda weird
33084,I know handsome cis women and beautiful cis men.
33085,Good luck with your journey.
33086,Such a good one.
33087,Credit to Mari Andrew!

33089,"Much love to all the ""Reddit Moms"" who fill in for those of us who have either lost our moms or drew the short straw and had a bad mother."
33090,You all deserve the karma you receive.
33091,💜
33092,"To be honest, I’m here for a few reasons but a big one is that I’ll never be able to have a kid."
33093,"I don’t really think I would even want to carry a child, but I wish I was born with the option."
33094,"I want to cherish and love a child better than my parents ever did to me, though."
33095,And so I’m here to be that mom if I can.
33096,I love you all
33097,Big hugs to the mamas with mentally ill mothers 😞
33098,Yes!
33099,And also to anyone who mothers in whatever form they do so.
33100,Thank you for the digital roses.
33101,Even though you don't know me or my life it's still comforting today to remember her.
33102,Mothers Day has been hard for a while.
33103,I lost my mom years ago.
33104,It’s hard.
33105,I’ve wanted children for a while but it just hasn’t happened.
33106,Then this year I had a chemical pregnancy.
33107,It broke my heart.
33108,I fucking hate Mother’s Day.
33109,But I needed to see this.
33110,Love to everyone here 🌹💜
33111,"Mom energy is such a special thing, and you don’t need to have human children yourself to share that energy."
33112,I love this sub.
33113,I had a strained relationship with my mother before she passed away.
33114,I wish it could have been different and I'm still mourning the mother I never had.
33115,Thanks for this!
33116,"I’m a Nurse & have had heard so many heartbreaking stories of siblings trying to keep other siblings clean, fed & safe from their parents or other predators."
33117,I’d like to lift up all the sibs that often sacrificed themselves to protect another!
33118,I’m thankful for this group!!
33119,!
33120,"Thanks for everyone in this sub, even though I only lurk, mother died 3 yrs ago and all of these people here Help me cope."
33121,To anyone else who missed their window.
33122,"Of course the usual forgotten category to this picture is the stepmoms who do all the work of a mother day in and day out for someone else’s child, yet receive absolutely no acknowledgement or credit…."
33123,How absolutely lovely!
33124,Thank you!!
33125,!
33126,I lost my mom in December 2020.
33127,Mother's Day is just a day anymore.
33128,my real mother is horribly abusive.
33129,I love all u moms here <3 very much
33130,"To everyone on this BIG day - whatever the day brings you, may it be meaningful, peaceful, and, most of all, a day of your choosing."

33138,I enjoy coming on here and offering advice and virtual hugs and motherly love to those that want or need it.
33139,Happy Mother's Day to you all.
33140,Thank you!
33141,This was touching
33142,Thank you so much for including those who have lost mothers
33143,I  l o v e  t h I s
33144,"Pop is takes mother's day a little hard, we lost grandma a few years ago."
33145,Seeing this was really sweet and interesting.
33146,Hope you all had a great mother's day!
33147,"Cherish life and those in it, peace and love"
33148,I like it.
33149,Mother’s Day was rough: incontinence plus assault flashbacks plus estrangement.
33150,I’m doin better today but this post really helped.
33151,Thks
33152,I get a lot of shit for not wanting children.
33153,"I don't have friends because of my ""selfishness and immaturity""."
33154,Seeing this post made me want to cry a little for just being included.
33155,Thank you.
33156,Mother's Day is MOTHER'S Day.
33157,It is not your day if you chose not to be a mother.
33158,Wishing happy mother\`\`\`s day to people who have CHOSEN  not to be mothers is the same as wishing happy Hanukkah to Christian or Muslim people.
33159,Or saying that being an Atheist is a religion.
33160,"I really like the concept, but I’m confused."
33161,Why are we wishing happy Mother’s Day to those who have chosen not to be mothers….?
33162,Lol
33163,"Bottom center kind of defeats tthe point though, there's woman's day for that."
33164,"I hate to make this about me, but this is a very weird day having a very distant relationship with my mother."
33165,Thanks!
33166,Nice
33167,What are the blue flowers?
33168,"I'd love to put some on my table, as they really hit the nail on the head."
33169,"Yes, it is."
33170,I didn't know who created it but wanted to share the sentiment.
33171,Thanks for adding her info.
33172,[deleted]
33173,Another childless person here.
33174,I could have chosen to have children but decided not to.
33175,"In all honesty, I am a better internet Mom for a Minute than the real life deal."
33176,"As a trans woman starting later in life, it breaks my heart that I can never have kids, and that  there are so many queer kids who aren't loved by their parents."
33177,"I'd love to adopt, but that isn't an option right now 💔"
33178,"Hey sister, I’m sad for you that Mother Nature (or your god) made that so."
33179,You are a star for all you do to step in to be the Mom someone needs right then.
33180,It’s an amazing gift you’re sharing and I thank you for it!
33181,"I’m here to do the same, though my root cause was different."
33182,Happy Mother’s Day!!
33183,!
33184,I legitimately can't read a single comment from this sub with out you mom's making me cry.
33185,Thank you for being here
33186,Big hugs back ❤️
33187,Had a wild debate with someone last Mothers Day who was very much opposed to sharing the day with anyone other than child-bearing and child-rearing mothers.
33188,I tried so hard to explain that sharing that appreciation does not *diminish* her life and effort in any way.
33189,It made me sad and I'm really happy to see that this post isn't getting the same aggro.
33190,Feel this so deeply as someone whose mother a.)
33191,didn’t want me to begin with but was stuck due an abusive relationship/not being able to give me up for adoption and b.)
33192,"is a survivor of the emotional, verbal, financial, and physical abuse she subjected me to for most of my life."
33193,I don’t have siblings and I don’t have a relationship with any of my family members by choice (though their actions forced me to make that tough decision).
33194,It feels like the mourning never ends when you mourn something/someone that doesn’t exist.
33195,Sending so much love your way and I can only imagine how strong you are.
33196,Happy Mother’s Day to the amazing stepmoms out there!!
33197,"This is one of those times when titles stink, and why maybe stepmoms get missed."
33198,"Y’all do wonderful work filling the gaps for the kids, which can sure be tough if the bio Mom is around."
33199,Or isn’t.
33200,Like threading a needle sometimes.
33201,Tough work from amazing Moms (no “step” needed).
33202,Same here.
33203,Much love from a fellow survivor<3
33204,People who dislike you because they don’t agree with/can’t understand your choices wouldn’t make good friends anyway.
33205,"Jus sayin 😏
However, I’m sure you will find your people one day, they do exist!"
33206,"And they will like you for who you are, not what they think you should be like."
33207,In the meantime there’s always us here.
33208,😘
33209,happy mothers day lol
33210,So do you believe that only people who have physically birthed a child should be posting here?
33211,"Because to me those who chose to be motherly figures in other ways or adopt should be just as welcome here, and since we’re here we are being inclusive of all the ‘moms’ here"
33212,"Yeah, it’s not a woman’s day"
33213,"Yeah, this has irked me too, if you have chosen to NOT be a mother why would you be celebrated on Mother's day?"
33214,?
33215,There are people that either can't or don't want to have children but are still motherly to others
33216,I've heard it meant giving a child up for adoption.
33217,"Because being a mother is a societal imposition in our society and most women who choose not to be mothers face lots of people's disapproval, prejudice, and are sometimes estranged from friends and family for that choice."
33218,"They too deserve flowers on this date, to remind them that they are complete and whole, no matter their choices, as most days what they hear is the opposite."
33219,I honestly hated these things in school.
33220,My mom wasn’t completely absent so I never had to endure anything like you did but the thought crossed my mind for others.
33221,"My school also had really strict rules about the person coming being you mother and not a grandmother, sister, aunt, etc."
33222,which just felt unnecessary to me tbh.
33223,Happy Mothers Day to you!!
33224,You are wonderful for sharing your love and shining a light on some kiddos in need.
33225,Thank you for what you do!
33226,Childless also.
33227,Was too scared of screwing them up the way I feel screwed up.
33228,But I’m a great listener and offer Auntie advice or sisterly advice when asked.
33229,That’s all I could hope for.
33230,I tried for many years to have one with my ex wife.
33231,"We are now divorced (very messy at that), I have MS and am in my forties."
33232,I’m grateful now that I was unable to have a child.
33233,"It was heartbreaking at the time, but all things considered, it’s better."
33234,And now I have all the loving mum energy to give to people who need it
33235,"I’m trans too, although I learned this pretty young."
33236,"I hope that helping people here can help satisfy your need for the mom experience, its helped me quite a bit."
33237,"Happy Mother’s Day, sis :) thank you for your kind words, I appreciate the fuck out of you"
33238,I’ll always be here hun.
33239,I can’t abandon my little ducklings
33240,Thank you for your response.
33241,I hear you on the family front.
33242,I had to cut communications with all but one family member.
33243,"I do have a sister biologically, but I haven't been in touch with her for years and whenever I see her from across the street (she lives one town over) I can feel myself start panicking."
33244,Know you're not alone.
33245,"If you need an ear, let me know."
33246,That is different.
33247,But that needs to be specified.
33248,"This picture is basically saying “Everyone should be celebrated on Mother’s Day,” which defeats the purpose."
33249,But it’s MOTHER’S day 😒 Literally defeats the entire purpose.
33250,"Thank you, Momma Bear, for being a Mom to me on this day!"
33251,Happy Mother’s Day- I know your love and support is so appreciated here!
33252,"The feeling is mutual, sweet girl."
33253,Hugs!
33254,Then ignore it
33255,Hugs!
33256,I love hugs.
33257,No
33258,Haha ok then  I guess keep wasting your time and energy cool dad
33259,lol saying “no” was the only thing I’ve said in hours
33260,**Congrats!
33261,"**

**Hooray!"
33262,"**

Achieving your goal of your own place for the first time is incredible, and worthy of celebration!"
33263,I'm so proud of you.
33264,Things are just stuff.
33265,This is already your home.
33266,Enjoy slowly adding items you love to personalize it and make it more comfortable but please don't feel rushed.
33267,Hooray!
33268,Congratulations.
33269,Nothing like having your own space.
33270,I furnished my current place with a ton of stuff I found on my local Buy Nothing Facebook group - highly recommend checking that out!
33271,Congrats!
33272,"If you know of a more affluent area near you, find out when bulk trash picks up."
33273,"Often, there are really nice pieces of furniture put on the curb and is free."
33274,"Proud of you, doll."
33275,(':
33276,such a big accomplishment you've made!
33277,i can't wait to see what you do with the place ♥️ I've got a decent-ish stainless steel pots & pans set i could spiffy up and send to you!
33278,"but remember home is where your heart is, the stuff is all just stuff."
33279,it's so much more fun to randomly find things for your home than hunt for them.
33280,better luck too!
33281,lol
33282,So proud!
33283,Sometimes we sacrifice one thing to have another.
33284,You will add furniture in time.
33285,You're resourceful and driven.
33286,Can't wait to see what you add to your new place When the time comes.
33287,Was not expecting this many comments.
33288,Thank you all so very much for the kinds words.
33289,I haven’t smiled like this in a while.
33290,Thank you🥺
33291,"Hey, kiddo."
33292,I've been there.
33293,"I don't think I ever told you this, but when I was almost 19, I illegally rented my first apartment for 3 months just to get me through the summer between freshman and sophomore year of college without having to live in my parents' house again."
33294,"I shared a one-bedroom apartment with a college friend, and we both slept on air mattresses that were about one inch thick, with a bunch of blankets piled on top of them so we couldn't feel the floor so much."
33295,The air mattresses had to be reinflated every couple of days.
33296,They were also the closest thing to furniture we had in that house.
33297,"Sometimes, having a place that is *yours* where nobody gets to make decisions without you is enough to justify sleeping on the floor."
33298,Now it's time for the craigslist free ads.
33299,"Good luck, enjoy the new place!"
33300,That's amazing!
33301,I remember the first time I did that and it was...an awful place.
33302,"I mean, NYC overpriced apartment with the bathroom down the hall."
33303,I LOVED IT.
33304,So proud of you!
33305,You did it!!!!!
33306,Check out Freecycle.
33307,Enjoy!!!!
33308,Yay!
33309,!
33310,The floor IS furniture.
33311,Do you have a pillow?
33312,"Bravo, baby!"
33313,I did this too!
33314,"Serious advice- garbage pick in bougie ass neighborhoods, just nothing with cloth because it could have bugs."
33315,I have a pic like this of me and my husband and brother in our first apartment.
33316,Just sitting on the bare floor.
33317,Such a good feeling!!
33318,Enjoy
33319,CONGRATS!!!
33320,There is nothing like your own place!
33321,Very very proud of you!
33322,Hooray!
33323,I remember that feeling so very well!
33324,I furnished my first apt (except for my mattress cuz ewww) with stuff I'd find on large item trash days.
33325,People throw out all kinds of stuff...I preferred patio furniture cuz it's easier to clean before bringing in to my apt.
33326,Ask around at work and see if anyone is doing a spring clean and getting rid of stuff.
33327,I'm so proud of you and you should be too.
33328,Everything you will soon have will be all yours!
33329,Walmart has camp chairs for $9.
33330,They aren’t pretty but they have back support.
33331,I can’t sit on a floor like you are lol.
33332,These saved me while trying to find a couch.
33333,Good job!!
33334,Onwards and upwards.
33335,Nothing like your first place by yourself ❤️❤️
33336,You should look at Facebook marketplace.
33337,I'm not a fan of Facebook but I know that sometimes people will post furniture or appliances for either very inexpensive or free with pick up!
33338,But I am so proud of you dear.
33339,You are a strong person and you got this!
33340,Very proud of you!
33341,"Great job, little one!"
33342,What a great feeling!
33343,Congratulations!
33344,Mom is proud of you!!!!
33345,Way to go!!!!
33346,!💕
33347,"Yes babe, you rock!!"
33348,I know this will be a happy place!
33349,When I started out I got a little house plant and that made me smile when I came home.
33350,I hope you can get some furniture soon.
33351,Take care
33352,Baller.
33353,Big ups
33354,I'm so proud of you!
33355,You're doing such a great job!
33356,I started much the same way.
33357,You're going to go far with this type of commitment!
33358,You're doing great.
33359,You can acquire things as you go.
33360,Gives you time to really plan out what to do with the place.
33361,What an accomplishment!
33362,"Congrats, hon"
33363,Ahhh freedom.
33364,"If you have a car and a knowledge of when trash pick up day is, drive to a good neighborhood and trash pick some furniture."
33365,My parents found $500 stapled to the inside of one once like 30 years ago.
33366,"This is the best, Babe, a place to call your own and you can exclude anyone and any thing that interferes with your peace and happiness"
33367,Carpet looks comfy!
33368,Good job love!!
33369,"Cheers, I’m proud of you."
33370,Check out your local Buy Nothings on Facebook- you’ll get furniture no problem!
33371,"Hi Sib,
There is this app called NextDoor that you may want to look into."
33372,It’s limited to your immediate neighborhood but there are a lot of people there(depending on the neighborhood) who sell/give away the stuff they don’t need for cheap prices.
33373,You have to get verified I think so there are no scammers either.
33374,"If you are so interested, check it out to furnish your apartment for much cheaper cost."
33375,It helped my brother out a lot when he got a new place.
33376,"Anyway, a big congrats to you!"
33377,Yay!
33378,"Check out garage sales, estate sales, and thrift stores to find furnishings and kitchen stuff."
33379,Congratulations!!
33380,That’s such a huge accomplishment!
33381,If there’s a move in registry or go fund me I’m sure people would be down to donate what they can to make the move easier.
33382,Link it if you’re interested!
33383,*edit: predictive text
33384,Your home is beautiful.
33385,❤️
33386,I just did the same with my fiance!
33387,I’ve been homeless since September last year and it’s amazing to finally have a place to call my own!
33388,"If you need furniture, Facebook market place is good if you feel comfortable and find trustworthy people in your area."
33389,You can also use the Nextdoor app to find things being given away or sold by people in your neighborhood.
33390,Good luck!
33391,Yay you!
33392,Congrats!
33393,"🎉 
For the record- my fist place I slept on a pile of blankets with a sheet on top until I found a bedroom set."
33394,Goodwill and thrift stores are great.
33395,Still have some of my Goodwill plates 30 years later.
33396,"Congratulations 🎉 

offer up app has tons of free things and so does Craigslist."
33397,"Download all the apps to the stores you shop at and clip those digital coupons, they truly help."
33398,"If you have a dollar tree, they have some wonder house stuff."
33399,"I gotta ask anyone it concerns but does it weird anyone else out that the grey carpet, wood baseboards, white walls, and the 20yr old outlet covers are just so universal to rentals."
33400,"Like I'm 90% convinced OP lives in my apartment complex, lol."
33401,Furniture is overrated anyways.
33402,"I've lived on my own for over 12 years and all I have are 4 book shelves, a foldable plant shelf, a kayak in the livingroom, a bedroom side table, a tv stand/cat hammock, and a box spring and mattress on the floor."
33403,"If you gotta move stuff yourself, it sucks to have a lot of things."
33404,But if you want stuff people get rid of nice free stuff all the time.
33405,"Tables and stuff, might just need cleaning."
33406,Congrats on getting free.
33407,Congratulations!!!
33408,Take your time and buy a piece at a time.
33409,"Invest in a bed first, then work on a table and chairs."

33411,Keep up the great job!!
33412,!
33413,Congrats!!
33414,You may be able to find free or cheap furniture at garage/yard sales.
33415,I did the same for my first apartment.
33416,I had nothing but it was all mine.
33417,I didn’t even own a bed for years and slowly accumulated things.
33418,I’m so proud of you!
33419,You have your own sanctuary now and a place that’s all yours and that is a wonderful feeling!
33420,Your amazing and clever!
33421,"Having a safe space to call your own is a great achievement, well done xx"
33422,Try an app like Klarna.
33423,"They allow you to make a purchase, like a mattress or dresser."
33424,They send it to you and you pay it off in 4 installments.
33425,[deleted]
33426,I love this!
33427,Looks like my first apt - but I did have a cardboard box table!
33428,You are on your way!
33429,No stoppin you!
33430,Go get’em tiger!
33431,!
33432,You're about to have the best time of your life.
33433,"It seems like not too long ago, I was where you were."
33434,You got this!
33435,Heck yeah!
33436,"It looks like other people mentioned it as well, but I got easily 3/4 of furniture and household stuff for free or extremely cheap by trash picking and scouring marketplaces."
33437,I find the trash schedules for nice apartment complexes and middle class neighborhoods and just drive around after work and snag some real good stuff!
33438,"I just set everything in my moms driveway, Lysol the heck out of it and give it a nice glow-up."
33439,Good luck!
33440,"Better to be in a happy place, even if it means rocking out an air mattress for a couple of weeks."
33441,"The rest will come in time, enjoy this win for what it is!"
33442,"You’ll look back on this someday and see how far you’ve come, and right now you’ve already come a long way!"
33443,Congrats on the new place.
33444,"Congratulations, honey!"
33445,Your picture made me smile.
33446,"Your apartment is like life, sweetheart, you start with little but gradually you'll fill it with things and people that are important to you."
33447,And you allready have the most important things there: yourself and your freedom.
33448,I’m so proud of you!
33449,This is a heck of an achievement!
33450,"Hey, there are a bunch of folks out there giving away stuff."
33451,"In fact, join your local Buy Nothing group and explain your situation."
33452,I know of a once-houseless single mom who got her entire studio apartment furnished.
33453,Her toddler now has a safe place to call home.
33454,❤️
33455,That strip of sunlight looks wonderfully hopeful.
33456,You have all the power to make this place your own.
33457,A lot of cities have houseplant enthusiast groups on Facebook.
33458,"If you want some plants, folks are often generous in sharing cuttings."
33459,Congratulations!!
33460,You've done so well!!
33461,Remember to check out free cycle and Facebook groups as lots of people give old furniture away all the time!
33462,Congratulations on your new home!
33463,I was in the exact same position as you were when I got my own place a year and a half ago but the peace and quiet was heaven.
33464,The place is fully furnished now because I got things for free on gumtree etc.
33465,So have a look on there.
33466,Congratulations and good luck!
33467,If you have about $50 I got a really comfortable 2” foam mattress topper from Amazon from lucid.
33468,I’m buying another one to use when I go camping!
33469,It’s so comfortable on the ground!
33470,Also where do you live?
33471,I’m getting rid of my couch and loveseat this month when I buy my friends couch and loveseat… and my current couch is really comfy to sleep on.
33472,When I moved into my first house I slept on the floor for a few weeks then my roommate moved in and brought a couch and I slept on that until I could afford a mattress on the floor.
33473,:)
33474,Mattress shops are a scam.
33475,Get a foam one.
33476,And never go with spring mattresses
33477,"I'm so very happy for you, and don't worry, you will build the life that you want and the home that you want."
33478,It will just take time and effort.
33479,I'm so very proud of you baby!!
33480,!
33481,Congratulations!
33482,"As a tip: get plates, cutlery and mugs from thrift/charity shops - added bonus that you can get some ridiculous kitschy stuff, but that might just speak to my tastes."
33483,Congratulations!
33484,You did it!
33485,Shop sales and thrift but don't settle.
33486,Don't buy something just to have it.
33487,Wait until you find something you love before you buy.
33488,Congrats!
33489,Join your local buy nothing group on FB.
33490,People give away so much!
33491,That looks so peaceful without any furniture or stuff.
33492,"When I moved out on my own I told all kinds of people, at work, friends, etc."
33493,I remember being so surprised how many people were saying things like “I have a table under my bed that I keep meaning to get rid of.
33494,Would you like it?
33495,The legs screw on.“ or “my dad is on my case to get my twin bed from college out of his garage.
33496,"I’ll give it to you if you have any way to drive over to his place and get it.“

So be talkative in the places that you go with people that you know, even casually."
33497,You might be surprised
33498,Get an aerobed.
33499,They are really comfy and not cold like most airbeds.
33500,dollar tree can get you everything you need for the kitchen on a budget.
33501,they even have really great quality bowls and plates.
33502,congrats on your new place!

33512,Many well wishes and positive thoughts for the future💞
33513,Congratulations!
33514,I think it’s a beautiful canvas and you are going to make it so perfectly you!
33515,OfferUp is a great place to find deals on furniture!
33516,I recently had to make a new bedroom in my house and checking it everyday I was able to snap up the good stuff that goes quick.
33517,Lots of people are happy to help get it to you for a couple extra bucks.
33518,The Neighborhood app is a good resource too!
33519,This is actually one of the best moments in life.

33521,I'm so freaking proud of you!
33522,"As a mom, I have a little tip = make sure to join the ""buy nothing"" facebook groups for your area and check it often, or even post something you you're looking for."
33523,"You'll have ""stuff"" for your space before you know it - and for free, which is quite afordable."
33524,"This a such an accomplishment, sweetie!"
33525,Congratulations!
33526,<3
33527,Idk if you will see this but if you happen to be near the south west US please dm me.

33533,Great job darling ❤️
33534,congrats!!!!
33535,ask family members or friends if they have furniture or stuff you may need that they don’t want.
33536,yard sales or swap meets are great also!!
33537,enjoy your new memories!
33538,!
33539,congratulations!.
33540,That's awesome.
33541,You'd be surprised what you can get for free off FB marketplace.
33542,My motherly advice would be that if there is one thing worth saving up to get it's a new mattress.
33543,You can get the roll up memory foam kind from Amazon for around 200 for a twin.
33544,I've seen them for less.
33545,And you can get a metal bed frame for about 75.
33546,You're going to spend a lot of time in bed and you really don't want a used one!
33547,Also one good non-stick pot and frying pan.
33548,And a knife.
33549,All under $25.
33550,And Ross has some really good pots and pans for cheap.
33551,Good luck!
33552,Congratulations!!
33553,I remember doing this.
33554,I luckily did have a bed that someone gave me and an old tv that I brought from my moms.
33555,I was so happy sleeping in my almost empty apartment.
33556,I was so proud of myself in that moment and I am so proud of you right now.
33557,You are awesome!
33558,You did good!
33559,Keep up the good work!
33560,You are on your way.
33561,You did the hardest part.
33562,You can furnish it in time.
33563,My first apartment was stocked with plastic milk crates and free cycle stuff - give aways.
33564,Just don't do curbside pick up of sofas - pee/bugs typically inhabit them.
33565,If food ever gets tight remember food banks are OK to go to.
33566,"(not a mom) but i cant help myself, check the free section of craigslist, genuinely good furniture people usually just cant take it when they move or they get newer stuff, definitely worth a look!"
33567,"Check out Nextdoor, its sorta like facebook but for local areas only."
33568,Alot of older folks give away free furniture and stuff on there and itll never be too far
33569,Awesome!
33570,Take your time furnishing it.
33571,Get the basic necessities now and add in quality furnishings as you are able.
33572,An Ikea dresser that has to be replaced each time you move will cost more in the long run than a solid wood piece.
33573,Enjoy the process!
33574,That's  great!
33575,Congrats!
33576,"Honey, I am so so proud of you!"
33577,"And you know, I’ve had more money and less money- but I’ve found the most pleasure in slowly filling a space with things I really love."
33578,You’re going to do great!
33579,Fuck ya!
33580,"Keep it that way, and ur golden!"
33581,U got it made!
33582,Congrats!!
33583,Enjoy your new place!!
33584,Check local FB groups and Good Will for thing you may be able to get cheap.
33585,"One step at a time, everything will come together for you hon!"
33586,!
33587,Congratulations!
33588,Time to scour Marketplace and NextDoor!
33589,Congrats!
33590,Check on FB there are pages that are called FREE/NO BUY your community name.
33591,"People sometimes just want things out of their house, might be a good place for furniture."
33592,Best of luck in your new adventure!!

33595,Have fun making it yours.
33596,I’m so proud of you.
33597,So proud of you!
33598,Thrift stores.
33599,Recently helped a family who lost everything in a fire.
33600,"Clothes, shoes, furniture, cookware, dishes, sheets,towels, you name it, we found it."
33601,Including some pieces that were free to haul away.
33602,"Plus you're helping a good cause usually (three locally - 1 benefits a church outreach and food pantry, 1 hospice care, and 1 animal shelter"
33603,"Remember this time 

Also this picture is perfect

You should write an email to yourself that doesn’t arrive for 10 years (there’s a way to do it with Gmail I believe)"
33604,"Outstanding, OP!!"
33605,I am sure you worked hard to get there.
33606,I am so proud of you!
33607,Good for you man!
33608,This was us 25 years ago.
33609,Our first couch was from someone’s garbage that they threw out.
33610,Wishing you all the things you want and so proud of you.
33611,Even though I’m a dad.
33612,You did so good.
33613,I know how hard it can be.
33614,"But you made it and now you can make the next step, and the one after that."
33615,Little victories.
33616,So proud of you!
33617,Can’t wait for you to make it your own!
33618,Post updates!
33619,Pool floaty and some blankets.
33620,Set.
33621,So proud of you!
33622,Every month you will make little improvements.
33623,Please accept help that is available to you.
33624,"Food pantries and government assistance can help you have money for the other things you need like sheets, dishes and toothpaste."
33625,Do not turn down offers of help.
33626,"Someday, you will be able to pay it forward."
33627,You have achieved an amazing milestone!
33628,Wow !
33629,So proud of you !
33630,id be rolling all over that sunny carpet man
33631,I got a cheap mattress in a box off Amazon when I first moved into my apartment on my own.
33632,"The plan was to get a nicer one later but I actually kept
it for all 3 years until I moved."
33633,It was called Classic Brands Cool Gramercy 14 in hybrid mattress and I paid around $130.
33634,Just check camel camel because it looks like it’s a bit pricier than I bought it!
33635,Good luck- you’re doing great!
33636,I don’t know who you are or your story but I am so proud!
33637,Don't underestimate an air mattress.
33638,I slept on one for 3 months during an internship out of state.
33639,No reason to furnish the apartment I was in.
33640,Just make sure to get a self inflating or a compatible air pump.
33641,Word.
33642,Just enjoy a space unencumbered by things.
33643,Stretch out on your carpet.
33644,Nap in some sunlight.
33645,GJ.
33646,Freecycle.org is another resource you may be able to utilize to gain furnishings & more.
33647,I’m proud of you.
33648,Stay safe!
33649,Congratulations!
33650,You deserve it
33651,"You can do it sweetheart, I did it waaaaay back in the day."
33652,Baby steps and some days it’s one step forward two back but that’s life.
33653,Hugs 🤗
33654,"Great feeling, enjoy."
33655,"Pro tip, find all the Facebook free furniture groups in your city/ suburbs areas."
33656,At least where I’m from people give away a lot of decent stuff for when you can’t afford your own
33657,Baby steps you will get the furniture with time... Keep the baby steps and you will get there.
33658,Congratulations and well done.
33659,This is the start of a whole new journey.
33660,"I was there once, I had a blow up mattress on the floor and a corkscrew but then, what more do you really need?"
33661,"Although, don't get the corkscrew too close to the mattress or disaster occurs."
33662,"This is amazing news, sweetheart!"
33663,You'll make this a home in no time.
33664,"Use the Buy Nothing pages on Facebook, make your wants/needs known, and remember that not everything that is free is worth it."
33665,Be picky and respect your new home by bringing good energy into it.
33666,You're going to do great.
33667,Connect with your local BuyNothing network and browse the Free category on Craigslist.
33668,Proud of you!
33669,!
33670,Congrats!
33671,"I've been there and I remember being stupid excited and super scared, a whole slew of emotions."
33672,I highly recommend finding out the trash schedule in any higher income areas near you.
33673,"Drive through the night before, people put all sorts of good stuff at curbs for trash pick up."
33674,"My entire first living room was curb finds that I brought home, cleaned up and made mine."
33675,"Also, thrift stores!!"
33676,Good luck and best wishes.
33677,"Check Facebook, check charity shops, the sides of streets, figure out if you have friends/neighbours moving close by."
33678,"I slept on a nest of linen for the first 3 weeks, but I’ve been in my place two years this week."
33679,It feels… free
33680,Haha I been there .
33681,"I could’ve stayed living with my aunt but it’s not a good look tryna bring chicks over , an I just wanted my own privacy but congrats fr sometimes I get frustrated like damn but I remember where I came from"

33683,Now start going to yard sales for cheap furniture!
33684,The best feeling in the world!
33685,Are you on Nextdoor?
33686,"I scored so much free furniture on there over the years, including a beautiful queen size solid oak bed frame and iron lounge chairs for outside."
33687,You may be able to find most of what you need without spending a cent!
33688,For furniture check out local college campuses at move out time.
33689,Lots of furniture gets tossed.
33690,Hi honey!
33691,"I've been there, done that."
33692,You know what I love to remember about those moments?
33693,How FREE I felt!
33694,You're doing great!
33695,Keep going!
33696,Congratulations!!
33697,I've been right where you are.
33698,It felt good.
33699,I slept on blankets/sheets on the floor and bought a couple of those cheap Walmart plastic chairs.
33700,I had a tube tv that I put on a piece of cardboard on the carpet.
33701,"Through time, I gathered donated old furniture and shopped at salvation army."
33702,You're living life on your terms.
33703,Congratulations again 🤗
33704,I’m very proud of you!
33705,The rest will come; keep up the good work.

33719,"🥳🥳 if you have Facebook, check out the local buy nothing groups in your area!"
33720,Congratulations!
33721,Please join your local buy nothing Facebook group and ask for furniture!
33722,I’m sure there’s plenty of people willing/looking to give away tables/chairs/couches etc.
33723,if you don’t have Facebook I recommend creating one just for that group!
33724,Good luck this is quite an achievement :)
33725,"Thanks, mom🥺"
33726,Hijacking the top comment to say WOW.
33727,I was not expecting this much support.
33728,I seriously haven’t smiled this much in a while.
33729,Especially not since my break up.
33730,You guys are all amazing🥺
33731,"Travel around in a car or a friends car the night before trash pick up- get rugs - cover the backs w vinegar and baking soda- let it dry - then vacuum -
Old wood furniture can be painted to refresh and you can often find paint at the curb as well
FB marketplace and Craigslist both have free stuff-
Also if you go to IKEA, Salvation Army, or goodwill and tell the manager you have no furniture at all."
33732,They will mark down their scratch and dent to nominal fees.
33733,I bought a microwave off of there!
33734,I saw a few beds but I’m not too sure how I feel about a used mattress.
33735,But at this point I might just have to.
33736,"Good idea, didn’t even think of that!"
33737,Means a lot more than you know.
33738,Thank you!
33739,This is why Reddit is the best.
33740,"Thanks so much for the gesture, but I do have a few pots and pans my grandma gave me so I’m all set there."
33741,Thank you🥺
33742,I have a pillow and a blanket!

33753,Step one get yo fine self somewhere comfy to sleep.
33754,Waking up exhausted ain't no way to live.
33755,Even a yoga mat and a decent pillow is a start.
33756,Facebook market place and thrift stores are your friend just Google what bed bugs look like because you really *really* don't want that shit.
33757,Churches and food banks often know where you can get free/super cheap home stuff.
33758,Good luck kid.
33759,You got this.
33760,You can do this!
33761,"Keep your nose to the Grindstone, do not overspend, give it a year or two or five if you need it, you can do this."
33762,"Find something that works, keep a journal, meditate."

33765,Former director of a shelter here: bed bugs could be the subject of a horror film.
33766,They are nightmarishly good at surviving.
33767,And they are EXPENSIVE to get rid of.
33768,"I understand the good intention, but I’d recommend just looking on Craigslist for stuff people are giving away."
33769,"Most people aren’t such jerks that they’d list something that they know is infested, but you never know why they put something out for trash pickup."
33770,Do not grab furniture out on the curb.
33771,You risk bringing home everything from bedbugs to flea infestation.
33772,"For mattresses, pay attention for posts that mention things like keeping it covered with a mattress protector,  how it's only x many years/months old, etc."
33773,That should help you get one of the better freebies in your area.
33774,You could also try Next Door--a lot of people there giving stuff away free.
33775,Sometimes when someone moves they just want their stuff to go to a good home!
33776,Also you can get perfectly good kitchenware & furniture very cheap at a thrift store.
33777,I got my brother a whole set of plates & flatware and a bunch of other stuff that way when I was helping him set up his apartment.
33778,Also got him furniture very cheaply on Next Door.
33779,So proud of you for doing this!
33780,"As an idea, I slept on an air mattress for six months when I had no bed."
33781,(I’m deathly afraid of bed buggies.)
33782,It wasn’t bad at all.
33783,I ended up being gifted a  safe second-hand mattress.
33784,Congratulations OP!
33785,!
33786,Straight up ask if anyone has an air mattress going unused.
33787,They’re often purchased for visitors then just languish in a closet.
33788,Someone might be more than happy to put with it!
33789,And not as many used mattress cooties with an air mattresss.
33790,"Just don't do re-used mattresses, once you get nedbugs in your home then it's like a forever fight!"
33791,!
33792,"When I moved without a bed or much money, I got one of those double layer air mattresses and used that until I could save up for a new mattress."
33793,"Its not ideal, but it's better than the floor or not knowing the history of a used mattress."
33794,Used mattress will be fine as long as it’s clean and not too old.
33795,You can make your mattress feel much better by adding a topper to it once you have a bit of money spare.
33796,"I’m not sure what country you’re in but a lot of the “mattress in a box” companies are actually really good now, so if that’s more your vibe that’s not a bad idea."
33797,I actually traded my very expensive mattress recently for a “box” mattress and I’m sleeping much better!
33798,"My first time moving out, I had a mattress, but no drawers or anything like that to put my clothes in."
33799,I stacked a set of boxes on their sides to make “shelves” and it worked pretty well until I could afford something more.
33800,"Listen, and I speak from experience, never buy anything with cloth or stuffing secondhand."
33801,"Wood, plastic, metal, anything that can be washed in hot water is fine."
33802,You’re better off with a sleeping bag on the floor until you can save.
33803,A plain futon and frame should be pretty cheap.
33804,"If you have a St. Vincent’s De Paul thrift shop near you, they give free new mattress out with their furniture vouchers program."
33805,Congrats on the new place!
33806,:) You might also want to look into getting an air mattress instead temporarily...they're cheap and still comfortable.
33807,"Probably better than a used mattress, especially given the bed big risk!"
33808,!
33809,"Zinus mattresses on Amazon are pretty cheap and comfy (~$180 for a double IIRC, just choose the thinner simpler models)."
33810,You don’t need a bed frame to start.
33811,It’s lasted me four years so far!
33812,Hope this helps.
33813,So excited for this next step in your life 💜
33814,"If by any chance you’re in the Tampa area, I have a TV and soon to be couch to give away!"
33815,"If you live near a college, dorm move out time is great for that, too!"
33816,Especially for international students it's easier to put the bulkier items on the curb than take them with.
33817,That's a trick I picked up that I wished I knew when I was starting out.
33818,Have fun decorating your new space!
33819,Hey OP!
33820,"Basically my entire apartment is furnished by picking up stuff off the street (and you’d never know, I am very proud of how my place looks)."
33821,"I also join Facebook groups of different neighbourhoods in my city, and they all give away free stuff ALL the time."
33822,You can also post in them and say “hey I just moved into a new place but I have no furniture” and ask if anyone has stuff they need to get rid of.
33823,Many people would rather just donate that old coffee table sitting in the basement than go through the hassle of selling it or dragging it to the local used drop off.
33824,Definitely be mindful of anything cloth/stuffed as there's the risk of bed bugs!
33825,"Once they're in your home, they're a nightmare to get rid of!"
33826,Estate sales (sound a lot fancier than they are!
33827,"), and consignment shops; also hospice resale shops (family donate a lot)."
33828,Congratulations!
33829,You're doing great!
33830,Waves from across the border between the Ambassador and Bluewater bridges...proud of you for getting a roof over your head!
33831,Everything else will fall into place!
33832,Darn no where close to where I am.
33833,Still best of luck in everything.
33834,Kinda random but something odd that I do is I don't actually own a normal bed I have a hammock with a like $80 stand from Amazon.
33835,It takes getting used to and isn't for everyone but it's worked great for me for the past 4 years.
33836,I found there are some very comfortable air mattresses at Walmart.
33837,Slept on it until I could get a mattress for real.
33838,I’ve slowly been getting stuff for my place.
33839,"If you have friends and family, make an Amazon wishlist!"
33840,A few old friends sent stuff to support and show how happy they are for me!
33841,"Reasonable reservation, but the application of vinegar and baking soda (an acid and a base) will kill most anything."
33842,Also UV is helpful or wrapping things in airtight plastic for a few days.
33843,Biology is awesomeness
33844,"Also, read up on how to look out for bed bugs."
33845,I had no idea next door existed!!
33846,Thanks so much!
33847,Look looks at
33848,I was literally browsing air mattresses from Walmart because my back is starting to hurt from the floor!
33849,They have one meant for camping and it’s twin size for only $20.
33850,I think I’m going to go get it.
33851,I second the air mattress option.
33852,So affordable and much better than taking a risk with a potential bed bug infestation.
33853,I actually just got a mattress off Facebook market place!
33854,I second the Walmart blow up mattress as a start.
33855,"Slept on one until I could afford a bed when I was younger, and it worked just fine."
33856,"They get in wood too, in the cracks."
33857,A flea egg can wait 9 months to hatch when it senses warm blood.
33858,Bedbugs also look for cracks.
33859,"Not worth it, especially if your broke already."
33860,"It's not perfect, and you get far too many people complaining & being busybodies, BUT, it's great for three things: furniture/household goods; references for handymen, plumbers, etc; and lost pets."
33861,Good luck!
33862,"craigslist still exists too- I've seen some like new, very expensive couches people were giving away for free, they just want them gone."
33863,I second someone else's suggestion to learn how to spot bedbugs.
33864,"You know what, Walmart has these great camping cots too."
33865,"They're small, not much more than $20, and SO much more comfortable."
33866,Plus you don't have to worry about leaks!
33867,Another option to consider is a body-length pillow if you  want to go very low cost.
33868,I think they're about $7.
33869,"Lay your body on the pillow, and use a box or something to lift the height of your head pillow."
33870,"(And if you don't have a regular pillow, use a rolled up piece of clothing.)"
33871,That’s even better!!
33872,I didn’t see them on the app but I’ll shop around!
33873,A cot might be a bit more comfortable over the longer term as well.
33874,I slept on an air mattress for an undesirable amount of time a few years ago and my back hasn't felt the same since.
33875,Plus if you have bad joints a camp cot is much easier to get up from in the morning being more elevated off the floor than just an air mattress :)
33876,Hit up an army surplus too.
33877,They might have a good deal on a cot until you can afford a bed.
33878,I was in your same spot about two years ago.
33879,Ended up buying a bed in a box from Walmart.
33880,Was about 100 bucks and was actually really nice quality.
33881,Wayfair has mattresses and beds really cheap.
33882,Not going to find one for 20.00 but when you have a few extra dollars you can get a new bed and frame for less than 200-300.
33883,If you can find a hammock that’s able to be put up in your space they can be a lot comfier for back pain depending on the person of course.
33884,Congratulations on getting into the apartment best of luck
33885,It sounds insane but mattress firm actually has the cheapest mattresses out of all the bed in a boxes I’ve ever shopped over (I’ve moved around a lot and have bought 3 in 5 years).
33886,"I think people expect them to have high end mattresses because it’s a traditional place to get a mattress, but mine was SO cheap and SO comfortable

Also OP, you don’t need a box spring as long as the frame has support through the whole bottom."
33887,You can get a super functional frame that basically folds out like a folding table for REALLY cheap online and it has all the support you could need.
33888,I second this for England.
33889,"Yes it's further away...  but

If you need a... full English Breakfast and the cafes near you do not offer one, you are very much welcome to come see my rainy corner of the UK and get one, no questions asked about why you didn't chose a different menu option and no judgement."
33890,You're safe here.
33891,Edit to add: we also offer Full Englishs for free... so it could potentially work out cheaper to fly all the way here for one than be closer to home and pay for one!
33892,I have a link about how you can preorder your Full English so it's ready for when you arrive...
33893,Thank you Canadian friend for considering Americans and our now limited options for poutine.
33894,This made me so happy.
33895,"Lucky for me, I live in Minnesota, which still has options for poutine."
33896,"I think I too would like to help those who need some poutine, no questions asked."
33897,"Thank you for your kindness, OP."
33898,Ditto if you feel the overwhelming need to come to Vegas.
33899,"It's mostly cheap to fly here, and if you tell any person ""I just need to go to Vegas this weekend,"" they'll all just mainly be envious."

34203,r/auntienetwork would love to hear from you
34204,I take this literally as well as figuratively.
34205,My home made poutine is not good.
34206,It is my great shame as a Canadian.
34207,Side note: where can I get some Lingonberry juice?
34208,I dream of Elsie’s Deli in Redbank.
34209,YOM
34210,NYC has a whole directory of places to get pizza from trained chefs with good ovens right on the city’s website.
34211,"Chicago is offering deep dish pizza, which some would consider a casserole."
34212,"Regardless, we have thin crust options aplenty made by the most professional chefs this side of Italy."
34213,As long as Mills wins we will have Poutine.
34214,LePage will ban or restrict Poutine.
34215,Time to get out the vote.
34216,Can we go to Spumoni Gardens for pizza too!
34217,Thank you so much!
34218,"I just joined the sub and I am looking forward to helping making sure those who need some poutine, can get it if they are out my way!"
34219,Seconded!
34220,I know that right now this all sucks but we are all here for you to make sure you get poutine that is authentic and cooked safely.
34221,Right?!?!
34222,This whole thing has filled my heart so much with all of the support.
34223,"Hey misstuckermax, I counted 69 words in your comment."

34232,I bet you're a good friend.

34234,Thank you so much for writing it up.
34235,"I don’t know how far it got passed around in Canada, but I appreciate your thoughtfulness, kindness and empathy."
34236,Ugh.
34237,This video kinda annoys me.
34238,Some of us can handle the consequences.
34239,Some of us ARE willing to risk lawsuit.
34240,Some of us are even lawyers.
34241,The reality is that the majority of people who are offering food will never actually have someone from out of state on their couch to get food.
34242,But these posts do have value outside of that.
34243,"First, it serves as encouragement for those living out of state that there ARE options and there ARE people who care."
34244,"If all these abortion networks are so silent, how the fuck are people supposed to find them?"
34245,2) it’s a reminder for everyone in our own circles that our homes are safe spaces for them if they need this type of food.
34246,"Gatekeeping giving a shit about this as “being katniss Everdeen,” even if your heart is in the right place, ain’t it right now."
34247,There isn’t one right way to care about this.
34248,"They don't mean poutine literally, they use it as an euphemism for something else entirely"

34255,We have to have each others backs.
34256,Men are hearing you too.
34257,Non-American men at least.
34258,We are utterly aghast at what the old white dudes in charge of your country are doing
34259,This whole post is very wholesome but this comment is super weird in the context.
34260,"To be fair, if any comes here for the actual breakfast as well, I cook a good one haha"
34261,Why?
34262, Colorado codified access to poutine regardless of residency into the state constitution.
34263,"NYS did the same thing, and I’m grateful to be living here."
34264,"I was going to say that if you’re in the middle part of the country, Poutine is available in MN, and you can save about an additional 5 to 7 hour drive to Canada for it (depending on where you’re traveling from)."
34265,We can help you get your poutine.
34266,I joined the group!
34267,It is full of friends who are always happy to help someone go camping or drive you to fine some poutine or be there with you if your stomach hurts afterwards.
34268,We can also help you find medicine if you ended up getting a parasite

34274,"I hope you find a state that embraces your decision to pick what you need from their menu

Sending love and hugs to you✨"
34275,I think I may be misunderstood.
34276,I am not a professional cook.
34277,"I am just passionate about making sure that people are enjoying safe, professionally made poutine, and am willing to offer my help in making sure people can access it when they need or want it."
34278,"I live only a short hop over the border in the Great Lakes region, and have lots of places near me where professionally made poutine is available."
34279,But I am in the Auntie Network as well.
34280,Right!?
34281,"If you don't live next door to Ikea that  but is hard  find, and it's so good."
34282,"My partner and I registered just in time for the primary and have the rest of the elections for the year bookmarked

Keep an eye on the Google maps directions to voting sites, ours had been changed to a house 5 minutes away."
34283,I got it fixed (thank goodness you can submit changes for review) but I don't know how many people went to the wrong place and didn't find the right one in time
34284,Mmmm.

34290,WOW.
34291,"I read the entire thing and was slightly confused, but just thought I was missing something."
34292,Now it's obvious and I'm embarrassed.
34293,Thank you for letting me know.
34294,Why's that?
34295,Noted!

34297,I don't think they serve breakfast.
34298,I would marry Colorado if I could.
34299,"Well, maybe not marry, but make sweet sweet harmony lol."
34300,They just have their heads on pretty well out there!
34301,Awesome!
34302,Thank you!
34303,"I’m not in the US or Canada so I can’t personally help with finding good poutine, except for trying to spread the word of the various networks out there to help anyone who thinks they want poutine!"
34304,I can’t offer physical help but I can help direct people towards those that *can* help!!
34305,I believe everyone should be able to access poutine whenever they want it!
34306,It has something to do with what's happening in the US right now.
34307,Poutine is an euphemism for the procedure that is being restricted right now
34308,"In the instance of this post, food is a euphemism for something else entirely."
34309,"You mention eating the specific food item, while the original comments are discussing the  hidden meaning."
34310,Ugh I just realised what the post is actually about.
34311,(Sometimes it takes a while for things to fall into place.
34312,)🤦🏻‍♂️ Sorry for the disruption and I hope everyone finds what they're looking for.

34316,England do very good breakfasts.
34317,"So did California, and I just want to extend the same invitation to anyone who would like to visit a taco truck."
34318,Which is why I'm so shocked they voted in Lauren Boebert.
34319,Yeah... no.
34320,The environmental abuse that goes on there is something reddit doesn't need to condone or Stan.
34321,Thank you for explaining.
34322,I see my misunderstanding.
34323,Sorry!
34324,ASD brain takes things literally 😂🙈
34325,"I meant for weed legalization, mushroom decriminalization and birth control in vending machines... sweet sweet harmony"
34326,"Sadly, other than the front range, Colorado is very red."
34327,Luckily the blue of the front range males us a purple state.
34328,The area she represents is VERY red and very difficult for anyone else to get into.
34329,"But we do have Polis for governor, I count that as a BIG win!"
34330,"No problem, I found it grotesquely funny!"

34664,Oh wow thank you!
34665,😊
34666,Thank you!
34667,!
34668,Ha!
34669,"Mrs. Bobcat, you saw it!!"
34670,"for him, that is a big smile and you are absolutely right!"
34671,Thank you so very much for your well wishes 💜💜
34672,Thank you so much!
34673,"I adore the dress too, I appreciate it!"
34674,Thank you!
34675,I am the girl in that dress that made me look better than I ever have before!
34676,TYSM 💜💜
34677,Thank you!
34678,"Thank you so very much, Mama!"
34679,"We celebrated in upstate New York, near Albany and the colors are just getting going!"
34680,They said it was a traditional Irish blessing👌🏽
34681,"Excuse me, but there’s no way you’re in your 40s!"
34682,Source - am in my 40s.
34683,;)
34684,"You are so kind, thank you!"
34685,Haha not the first time that has happened :) We are actually only 7 years apart.
34686,"zeezl, I have to say that I have only rarely seen an OP acknowledge every reply to their post."
34687,And you did that!
34688,"It says a lot about your nature, sweet girl."
34689,This MomForAMinute is so very proud of you.
34690,You are positively radiant so I doubt that ;) maybe its just all the happy but...
34691,I'm so glad you got to feel as gorgeous as you are!
34692,"I saw that, I was asking more specifically."
34693,"As in, do they know who wrote / spoke it, or was it some ""official"" blessing, etc."
34694,It doesn't seem to have any direct religious references so it doesn't seem likely to be a traditional religious blessing.
34695,I was just curious to know more as I am unfamiliar with any Irish traditions and really liked this quote.
34696,"As the commercial says, “maybe it’s Maybelline!” 😂 

That & a rockin’ pair of genes."
34697,Thanks 😊
34698,"Respectfully, while I see nothing wrong with people aging and that should be celebrated too, your skin is CLEAAARRR!!"

34702,"Oh ok, thought you didn’t see it!"
34703,Here’s an [article](https://www.claddaghdesign.com/blogs/irish-interest/irish-wedding-vows) describing it (and other similar vows).
34704,"It says it’s Celtic, so chances are it’s one of those things that’s been around so long no one knows where it came from, as seems to be most Irish traditions/phrases (I’m not Irish, just from my brief research cause the country is interesting to me!)"
34705,"Most importantly, you both look so **happy**!"
34706,"But also, silver is my favorite color and your dress is absolutely fantastic."
34707,"Aw ur too kind, thank u!!"
34708,!
34709,"And you are, Sweetheart…."
34710,Neat!
34711,Thanks.
34712,I appreciate you linking an article.
34713,Cheers.
34714,"Edit:  For anyone else reading this, the article says this quote is a traditional Irish wedding vow that a pastor would say to the couple after the wedding and before they left the church."
34715,"Thank you, I could not believe I found that dress at David’s Bridal about 12 days before my wedding lol."
34716,The only dress that made me smile when I put it on!
34717,And that smile was fortunately outshone by the wedding day smiles!
34718,xx
34719,Yw!
34720,And thanks for that tldr version☺️
34721,"Awww, I love when an Internet misunderstanding resolves happily 🥰"

34725,"Hi, mom!"
34726,I just wanted to let you know that I got engaged on April 2!
34727,My SO proposed on his birthday so I wouldn't be suspicious; he knows me so well and totally caught me by surprise!
34728,"You haven't met him before, but I'm sure you would've LOVED him as much as I do."
34729,It has been 7 years and a day since you passed away and there is not a second that goes by where I don't think about you.
34730,I wished you were here to help me envision my wedding.
34731,You always had a great eye!

Edit: Thank you so so much, you wonderful moms and sibs!"

35074,xxxx

35076,"Oh sweetheart, I’m so sorry."
35077,It must be so hard to loose both parents.
35078,Big mom sized hugs from me 💜
35079,"I doubt I’m old enough to be your mom, but I just want you to know you are infinitely loved and supported."
35080,"Anything you may be feeling right now in response to him dying is completely valid, and please for me, do a kindness to yourself and let yourself feel those things."
35081,"The pain may never go away, and the loss unforgettable, but one day you will be able to remember him past the pain you felt when he died and will be able to look back on your favorite moments together and a happiness will accompany your grief."
35082,"I don’t know what religion you are, but regardless i hope you find comfort in the fact that it is proven that energy never dies."
35083,At this very moment the energy that gave your father life is giving itself to all corners of the universe as you read this.
35084,"One day you too will be a part of that universe, as will your mom no matter where she is now."
35085,One day you will all be together again
35086,that's a very kind way to put it.
35087,very well stated.
35088,"💜

i'm so sorry your dad died."
35089,"you must be missing him fiercely, and worried about your mom on top of that."
35090,this is a lot to bear.
35091,do you have people around you?
35092,I’m so sorry.
35093,That’s heartbreaking.
35094,My aunt and uncle were divorced for over a decade before she died.
35095,On her death bed he told her he never loved anyone else.
35096,Neither of them dated anyone until after she died.
35097,"I think people assume if you aren’t together, it’s because you don’t love one another."
35098,But that’s not always the case.
35099,"I'm so sorry for your loss,  may his memory be a blessing."
35100,That is a wonderful picture of you with him!
35101,I pray for you to be able to cherish the time you had together
35102,Oh baby...
35103,I'm so sorry.
35104,I'm thinking of you and I know it doesn't help right now and I know you wish someone would just wrap you in a big mum hug and I promise I wish I could wrap you in that big mum hug and make it all feel better for a little bit.
35105,Sending you all the support and love to help you through this difficult time.
35106,"Please remember to take care of yourself, eat and hydrate."
35107,Take care of your emotional and mental well-being too.
35108,I say this because ot was very hard for me to get out of the sadness fog when my mom passed.
35109,"I think your mom appreciates all that you did for your dad, even if she doesn't know yet."
35110,I'm so sorry.
35111,you done the right thing for him.
35112,"As I've recently seen a similar thing happen close to me, this is quite emotional to read/see."
35113,I am so sorry.
35114,"I wish I knew what to say, or how to help."
35115,"I hope it doesn't offend you, but I'll pray for y'all tonight, for me it feels like the best I can offer aside from an internet hug of encouragement."
35116,"It will be okay eventually, just hold on."
35117,Edit:  Misspelling
35118,"Hey kiddo,

I'm so sorry that we haven't been able to talk since I was deported, but I'm SO HAPPY that you got to stay in the country I chose for us."
35119,"I know the situation isn't the best but at least you get to stay somewhere that you have a better chance, and that's what I wanted for you."
35120,"As for your dad, of course we were significant to each other, we gave each other you."
35121,"More than anything, I'm sorry you're alone now."
35122,"If I can't be with you, there's no one I'd rather you be with than your dad, and I'm so sorry for you that he's gone now too."
35123,"But you are strong, and you'll make it work."
35124,"I wish you didn't have to be so strong, but I know you'll do your best, and you'll have the best opportunities where you are."
35125,"Love,
Mom
(and also, another immigrant like you, like your mom)"
35126,I am so sad to read this and very moved by the other comments ❤ do you have any special memories with him you would share?

35136,💜
35137,Hugs to you ❤️
35138,"I'm sorry you're going through this heartache darling and I hope you feel the arms, of us all, around you."
35139,This pain is raw and like any wound will heal.
35140,You have memories to keep that connection with dad.
35141,I know you'll smile again.
35142,Maybe write some down and have lil stories for generations to read.
35143,Writing is also a helpful healing element for grief.
35144,I hope you find peace hon.
35145,I'm so sorry for your loss.
35146,"Oh, honey."
35147,I'm so sorry.

35149,Sending you tight hugs.
35150,Sorry for your loss.
35151,Sending love ❤️❤️
35152,"Baby, I’m so sorry you are alone with your mom or dad right now."
35153,"But if YOU are ok, if you have happiness or love or peace in your life, then mom is ok- because that’s what matters most to moms- their kids’ well being."
35154,Much love to you in this hard time.
35155,I hope you are surrounded by people that you love and feel safe with.
35156,I’m so sorry and can be an available ear if ever you need one - I can relate in a couple ways.
35157,Let yourself feel everything now and take care of yourself.
35158,I'm deeply sorry for your loss.
35159,I lost dad recently too and it's devastating.
35160,Mom and dad weren't together but we were always family.
35161,She visited the hospital with me when allowed and near the end he asked if she could help him shave instead of the nurses.
35162,I can't imagine losing both parents.
35163,"While it's unfair, you're so strong."
35164,Lean on the people you have around you and be patient with yourself.
35165,My deepest condolences.
35166,Huge hug.
35167,I’m so sorry for your loss and inability to contact your mom.
35168,I’m sorry about your dad.
35169,I'm so sorry for your loss.
35170,I'm so sorry for all you're going through.
35171,Reading even the little bit you wrote made me emotional.
35172,You are stronger than you know and I wish you all the best ❤️
35173,Oh Honey!
35174,I'm so sorry for your loss!
35175,"Angel, I'm so sorry this happened to you and hope you find confort in a safe place."
35176,I'm sure dad is at ease wherever he is.
35177,Big hugs for you.
35178,So sorry for your loss.
35179,My heat goes out to you and I hope you can find your peace.
35180,I'm so sorry.
35181,Random reddit mom hug coming your way!
35182,Sorry for your loss❤️‍🩹what did he die from?
35183,Hey pumpkin.
35184,"I know things are tough right now, but you have this handled."
35185,"Think of him often, remember everything he did, good or bad."
35186,"Honour him for the real man that he was, and laugh about the silly things he did."
35187,That is how you will get through this.
35188,I am so sorry I can't be there.
35189,But you know that I am always with you.
35190,"We both are there in everything that you do, and who you are."
35191,"Remember how proud we are, and will be, of the things you do and will do in the future."
35192,Sending you so much love
35193,Sorry for your loss.
35194,May his soul rest in peace.
35195,I‘m so sorry your dad died.
35196,Oh my biggest hug and love to you.
35197,"I hope you manage to get ahold of mom soon, Im so sorry about your dad."
35198,Sending you so much love
35199,Thank you ❤️
35200,"Yes, I have an incredible partner that has been there for me since the minute I found out."
35201,"That is very sweet, thank you for sharing"
35202,"I had a great aunt who passed away a few years ago now, her and her husband had divorced many years before but they remained best friends, and he is still my great uncle to this day, still welcomed to every family gathering (the rare ones we have these days)."
35203,This sub shows family is more than blood and marriage - it is the people with whom you share love and support and kindness and happiness
35204,"I remember on Christmas when I was like 7, he covered the Christmas tree in dollar bills for me to find, and then we went on a big shopping spree to get whatever I wanted :)"
35205,Thank you so much for sharing.
35206,"Your mom helping shave him is such a deep form of love, it warmed my heart to hear."
35207,I didn't get to say goodbye.
35208,I really wish I could have shown him an act of love like that before he passed.
35209,I'm happy to hear that.
35210,I'm sending virtual hugs but you definitely need in person ones to get through.
35211,Love to your partner for loving you.
35212,💜
35213,"Even though they’d been divorced before she passed, on the “weddings before my own” memory table, I had my aunt and uncle’s wedding commemorated."
35214,They were still a couple who had a great bearing on my life and relationships.
35215,Just because they couldn’t live together didn’t mean they didn’t still love one another and raise a child together.
35216,"She was a sweet, kind person."
35217,They just grew into very different people.
35218,And they fought.
35219,Living apart they got along great.
35220,They didn’t fight about little stupid things.
35221,They raised their daughter.
35222,What a fun memory!
35223,May his memories be a blessing.
35224,💗
35225,That is an awesome Christmas memory 😯 like from a movie!
35226,....hallmark spinoff?
35227,!
35228,"I don't know the details of your story, but I really believe they knew how much we loved them even when we couldn't be there."
35229,I hope it's something they could feel.
35230,It sounds a little cliche to say but it helped when someone reminded me.
35231,Don't beat yourself up for things you did or did not do.
35232,I'm sure he wouldn't have wanted you to do that to yourself.
35233,They would want us to feel at peace when we can and remember them fondly.
35234,"Take care of yourself friend, thank you for sharing as well."
35235,"Stop making life hard on yourself, it's tough enough as it is."
35236,Absolutely!
35237,"This is the mindset of the author of **Unf-ck Your Habitat**, Rachel Hoffman."
35238,She's a great follow on social media as she will give bitesize or adaptable suggestions for the day; and she has a Facebook community where people will share their adapted routines and celebrate each other's successes no matter how small.
35239,Doing *something* is better than doing *nothing* and who would ever be able to tell whether you were standing or sitting when you scrubbed that pan?!
35240,"I washed some dishes today, well done me!"
35241,Another favorite.
35242,Run the dishwasher twice if the dishes are extra dirty.
35243,Literally not a single rule that says you can't run it twice
35244,The ammount of times I have sat on the floor so I could cut up food or mix food because it was taking too long or because I was already in a lot of pain.
35245,It's been really embarrassing sometimes but I'm trying to be kind to myself.
35246,"I needed to hear that, thank you."
35247,"I've recently put most of my dishes into storage to force my self to do them more often, instead of letting them mount into a pile I can't bear to face, but in doing so, I feel like a failure as an adult."
35248,Yes.
35249,This was revolutionary for me.
35250,"GAD, MDD, CPTSD, Chronic Migraine, TMD, ED…."
35251,You don’t need to make up these arbitrary rules for yourself.
35252,There aren’t any rules.
35253,When I realized this… it made it a little easier to get things done.
35254,I would skip breakfast altogether because I didn’t want breakfast food.
35255,"Screw it, nobody is gonna arrest me for eating pizza rolls at 6am instead of breakfast food."
35256,Especially when the alternative was that I eat nothing.
35257,"I didn’t have the energy to do laundry, dry, sort, fold, hang, put away…."
35258,Soon I realized that I could throw all the clothes in my hamper after drying and drape them over something at home instead of getting stressed about putting them away.
35259,Too depressed to even shower?
35260,Sitting on the shower floor worked just fine.
35261,Dishes?
35262,Get disposable plates and silverware.
35263,Not any energy to prepare food?
35264,Get stuff you don’t have to prepare.
35265,You can only sleep at odd hours?
35266,Fine.
35267,Sleep at odd hours then.
35268,People tend to make rules up for themselves.
35269,Nobody is gonna sue you for doing the best you can with what you have.
35270,I’m still learning.
35271,I will say this was one of the hardest lessons I learned.
35272,"I was always told that ""good women don't need to sit"" by my mom growing up."
35273,"Even when on crutches for a leg injury, I wasn't allowed to sit to do dishes."
35274,"Even after she died, her words didn't."
35275,"My dad will tell me it's okay to sit, or take breaks, but I didn't want to be perceived as weak."
35276,"It wasn't until I was in my mid 20's, diagnosed with fibromyalgia, that I started to understand that I was doing more harm than good."
35277,"That it wasn't about weak or strong, it was about doing what was right for my body and my needs."
35278,"It's still hard, and I still hear her words in my head sometimes, but I understand that I'm not weak, I'm just me."
35279,Even if spoons aren’t particularly scarce: make it more efficient.
35280,reduce the wear and tear.
35281,"Businesses do, you should do."
35282,Make it efficient.
35283,"Make it fun, make it work better for you."
35284,Or is no rule about how to do these things.
35285,"There might be advice about which one is ergonomically efficient, but advice can be wrong"
35286,"Agree with the message but trying to figure out how doing dishes while sitting in a chair is possible, nevermind easier"
35287,If the dishwasher is only half full run it anyways!!
35288,"If that’s all you can manage right now, half a clean load is better then none."
35289,Thank you.
35290,I don't know if I'll change anything but feeling like I'm allowed to accommodate myself is nice.
35291,"Once I was watching a show about a Jamaican family and the eternally cheery upbeat mother was doing the dishes, as usual, in her usual calm and cheery manner."
35292,Someone questioned her about how she could stay happy doing mundane tasks and she replied ‘it’s therapeutic!
35293,Listenin to ma music and making dirty things clean’.
35294,It helped me reframe my thinking about tackling boring and repetitive tasks.
35295,I always play music and have her voice in my head when I wash stupid boring dishes lol
35296,I hate this culture in America (not sure if those in other countries experience this as well) that you can’t be being productive if you’re not standing 20 hours a day.
35297,"My mum would never let me sit while doing chores when I was a kid, and would yell at me if I wasn’t standing and bending to pick up every fucking thing on the floor."
35298,I sit in the shower all the time.
35299,"I used to stand up, but I couldn’t do it anymore."
35300,So I sit and run the tap and just feel the warmth of the water over me.
35301,It’s great for grounding.
35302,This absolutely hits home for me right now.
35303,I’m struggling with long COVID.
35304,Utterly exhausted all the time.
35305,It’s tiring just doing normal ADLs.
35306,I feel guilty because I can’t help out at work as much as I’d like to.
35307,"The frustrating part is that I did everything right—I got my 2 vax shots and a booster and I wore a mask indoors, etc."
35308,When will this end??
35309,?
35310,"My latest ""aha"" (as a middle-age mom with adult kids living at home) - everyone has two laundry baskets (smaller, ""bushel"" sized)."
35311,One basket is for whites/lights and the other basket is for darks.
35312,"When a basket gets filled up, then you wash a load of laundry."
35313,"No more sorting and doing three loads of laundry every week, just do a load when the basket is full (or one loads worth)."
35314,"I needed to hear this...

My mental health is down the drain and I have a kink in my spine that causes chronic backpain."
35315,"I was told that there is nothing anyone can do about it, because I was already an adult when they found it..."
35316,"Sometimes just showering takes a lot out of me, not just because of the backpain, but also because I'm a trans guy and it just makes me feel horrible..."
35317,"Sometimes taking a shower each day is all I can do, because my anxiety keeps me from even touching the phone."
35318,"I'm still taking steps to make things better, but they're small steps and I need time to recover in between bigger ones... My family thinks I'm just a lazy failure and keep telling me I need to hurry up, I need to finally get up and get things done, I can't be lazy... but small steps are still steps in the right direction."
35319,This is the best thing I’ve read in a long time.
35320,Needed to hear this today!
35321,!
35322,This just made me realize I need a big stool next to my sink for dishes.
35323,"Oh, damn!"
35324,I need to remember this at work.
35325,"And I absolutely, definitely, totally needed to hear this tonight!"
35326,"Thank you, OP."
35327,<3
35328,"I cut my hair short becaus I got stressed having to wash it, the thought of drying it killed all my spoons, so I would stress over it and postpone for days."
35329,Now it's short enough to dry on it's own.
35330,Many spoons saved!
35331, Ok in theory I agree with the sentiment.
35332,But why would you sit on the floor to do laundry?
35333,🤔
35334,I can’t recommend the book “How to Keep House While Drowning” by KC Davis enough.
35335,My therapist recommended it when I told her I was so exhausted with work and my mental illness that I couldn’t keep up with housework.
35336,"It has 31 “entries” and none are more than 2 pages long, which was great because I also didn’t have the energy to read a lot."
35337,"It’s full of little tips not only for cleaning, but for changing the way you think *about* cleaning."
35338,A lot of it has stuck with me and helped me get things done even when I’m tired.
35339,"I use a rolling mechanics stool in my kitchen, a stool in the shower, and my husband put bars near the toilets."
35340,No shame!
35341,I also count steps and combine things to make one trip out of many.
35342,Also when you're trying to do house work.
35343,Get a large laundry basket and fill it with items in the first room instead of running back and forth.
35344,Go to the next room drop off what goes there and pick up what doesn't belong.
35345,Repeat.
35346,I bring all my laundry into the couch and put the tv on while I’m folding clothes.
35347,Organizing drawers or anything- living room floor.
35348,If I fight myself it’s not going to happen.
35349,Took me a while to learn that.
35350,No shame in modifying the game to make it work for you.
35351,When I realized that the ironing board was adjustable and I could sit to iron fabric when I quilt?
35352,What a game changer!
35353,I can even iron while sitting on the sofa while watching tv.
35354,My husband asked why I was sitting on the floor drying my hair the other day.
35355,My legs hurt.
35356,"If I stood then, I wouldn’t have been able to do something else later."
35357,"For me it was ingrained rules my mother made for what people should and shouldn't do,  only took like 40 years to say fuuuuuck that."
35358,Now I actually enjoy doing things my way instead of drreading doing them based on pleasing somebody else.
35359,👍
35360,I sit to do dishes and cook any time I have a rough pain day sometimes it’s the only way to get things done
35361,"Jesus, yeah that really helps."
35362,"Thanks for posting this OP, I needed to see it."
35363,Sitting in the shower would be amazing… but I can’t afford a shower chair ;-;
35364,Naomi Ekperigin has a great bit about the benefits of sitting in the shower in her episode of The Standups.
35365,We're not alone!
35366,"As someone who suffers from a handful of chronic illnesses, I'm still learning to let myself do this kinda thing."
35367,This is a very good reminder.
35368,She mentions washing bedding every week.
35369,"I don't believe in washing my bedding every week; if I'm clean when I go to bed, then the sheets are fine for at least two weeks (or OMG, even a month)."
35370,Do you have a link to her socials?
35371,Is there a group or just the page you follow?
35372,I just started following the page but there doesn’t seem to be a lot of community engagement on first glance
35373,Yes!
35374,This is always great advice - a dishwasher uses less water than washing dishes in the sink anyhow 😉
35375,"I have no dishwasher, but I would do that if I did."
35376,"Two words: kitchen chair

Much more comfortable/easier to get on and off if you're having pain problems than the floor."
35377,"You will thank yourself, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it."
35378,Source: use a kitchen chair for long jobs myself.
35379,Nope.
35380,"Cutting down on the amount of things you need and use is a very mature thing to do, don’t let your mind rob you of the credit you deserve."
35381,Cutting down on your overwhelm isn’t failing as an adult.
35382,❤️
35383,Recognising your own capabilities and boundaries is A+ adulting.
35384,When my pain is really high I put a small sheet of parchment on my plate so washing is even easier.
35385,It's less wasteful than a paper plate but still saves time on cleanup.
35386,I have only two of every dish - I live mostly alone.
35387,I am the only one who uses them.
35388,"This way, I actually clean them."
35389,It’s a good way
35390,I'm literally contemplating one of each eating item per family member for this reason.
35391,"One plate, bowl, fork, knife, spoon, mug, and cup."
35392,Also - doing something is better than nothing.
35393,I likely won’t pass my exams this term.
35394,"Didn’t manage to study much at all, my mental health crapped out entirely."
35395,I’ll still do something every day.
35396,"And if that means most days I do half an exercises, then I’ll damn well be proud of that half exercises."
35397,"If you stayed up too late, don’t beat yourself up - just go to bed now."
35398,"You’re in bed late, yeah, but some sleep is better than getting none from the stress."
35399,Doing half your dishes is better than none.
35400,"If you couldn’t shower, washing your face is an achievement."
35401,"Every steps is good, they don’t have to be completed to count."
35402,"Fuck it, dust half your shelf and lie back down if you’re in pain."
35403,Sweep just the hallway.
35404,"It’s progress, no matter how much progress it is"
35405,"I've had so many people in my life tell me I need to sleep at night and get up early or I am automatically a failure... Insomnia is one of the symptoms of my depression, so my sleep schedule varies a lot, because there are days that I just can't sleep, and that made me discover, that I actually do way better when I sleep at odd hours... the best I could ever do, was lie down at 6pm, sleep until 10pm, stay awake for a bit, lay back down and sleep until 3 or 4am."
35406,Oof - I try to be so conscious of how what I say to my girls will grow and echo as they get older.
35407,A bar stool.
35408,"Some tall chairs, depending on what the base of the chair is like."
35409,"Or creative use of dishpans for soaking/scrubbing, so all you have to do with the sink is rinse them."
35410,"Can depend on how deep the sink is, too, but there's ways to make it work."
35411,I’m imagining a very tall chair!
35412,There’s a type of chair designed for kitchen use (mainly for those with limited mobility) called a “perching stool”.
35413,Some of them have an adjustable height and usually a slanted seat.
35414,"They allow you to rest, while slightly supporting yourself with your legs, and they’re the right height for you to use them while cooking or washing the dishes."
35415,"Before I ended up permanently in a powerchair, I had a perching stool in my kitchen that allowed me to sit while I cooked or washed the dishes."
35416,I wouldn’t have been able to do those things without it as I couldn’t stand without crutches.
35417,Tall padded swivel stool
35418,Also some dishwashers have a 1/2 load setting so that may help if you're worried about water usage.
35419,"I used to sit in the shower every morning, but found I'd regularly 'lose time' when I did, which is not ideal if you've got to get to work ;) Now I only sit when I wash my hair because doing something seems to make it less frequent (that said, I do occasionally 'lose time' even standing in the shower)"
35420,Does it help you feel safe?
35421,Showers are scary to me so I’d gladly sit if you can get clean that way since I can have a towel over my bad parts and wash the rest while sitting.
35422,Lmk if it is <3
35423,Hopefully soon.
35424,I'm so sorry you're struggling.
35425,I’ve never sorted whites and darks.
35426,Ever.
35427,Each kid has one basket and it al goes in the same load- even their sheets.
35428,No tears over here either.
35429,"Hugs to you, kiddo❤"
35430,"You're welcome, kiddo."
35431,Folding?
35432,Just as easy as sitting on a chair/couch.
35433,"I call myself a ""floor person"" because I'm usually more comfortable sitting on the floor than a chair; always have been, and pain makes it more so."
35434,"Plus, if I'm on the floor, I'll automatically end up stretching as I sit there, and that's a good thing for me."
35435,It's also easier for me to use the coffee table for sorting the laundry when I'm on the floor than leaning forward on the couch.
35436,"Though lately, I've been using the kitchen table for each load, folding it as I take it from the dryer, because I discovered the granddaughter LOVES putting away laundry."
35437,(More power to her - I hate it!)
35438,"So I labeled everyone's - not just her - clothing with words and pictures (she's 3), and now she wants everything in the house labeled..."
35439,I'm pretty sure my mom might have washed a whole load of just socks because I have fond memories of trying to match socks from the basket and the pairs taking over the living room floor.
35440,We always did it together while she watched her shows <3
35441,My husband sometimes does to fold.
35442,"If she reminds me to wash my bedding and I don't think I need to, I just wash the top pillowcases."
35443,They need more washing than the rest.
35444,I was like you until my wife and I started dating and ill be honest fresh sheets eveey week are worth the hassle of washing them.
35445,We have 4 sets we rotate through so its not like we're constantly washing bedding.
35446,Also got a duvet and covers so were not washing blankets all the time.
35447,I do my laundry every two weeks (usually when my baskets get full) so I just do my bedding then.
35448,It’s too much to do it every week lol.

35450,"Found it, though it wasn’t as easy as expected 
https://linktr.ee/TeamUfYH"
35451,https://twitter.com/TeamUfYH is the one I mentioned for regular little reminders.
35452,https://facebook.com/groups/1517970688277547/ is the official private group.
35453,Strict rules about participation to ensure it stays supportive and safe.
35454,For some reason the chair that I have for our table is just slightly too short to work on comfortably and my shoulders and arms will be in so much pain by the end of it.
35455,I'm so used to just sitting down and working on something that I've adjusted I guess.
35456,I have no idea how to get a chair that is the right height without spending hundreds trying to guess right until I finally get it.
35457,Help me learn this skill.
35458,Where do you knees go when sitting?
35459,"When sitting in a chair in front of my sink, my knees hit the sink cupboard."
35460,"If I lean forward to compensate, my back hurts?"
35461,Rolling mechanic's stool or a medical office stool.
35462,Those work great and the height is adjustable.
35463,"This \^\^\^

When I lived alone I had 1 bowl, 1 dinner plate, 1 smaller plate, one glass, one mug and half-a dozen spoons/knives/forks/teaspoons and that was it, I didn't need anything more so there was no point having it out (I had spares OFC because I'm a klutz but kept them in the cupboard)."
35464,Thank you 💖
35465,Y’all are my people.
35466,It’s like you knew I’d need these pep talks tonight.
35467,"yeah, sleep cycles are hard and weird, do what works for you."
35468,Though trying to keep it consistent as in doing the same thing every day (whatever that might be) may help.
35469,"I've had to force my sleep cycle into something ""business hours compatible"" unfortunately but at least sleeping at the same time each day has helped me get the best I can out of it."
35470,I have learned over the years to not hate her for it.
35471,"It's taken me a while, but I understand her words came from what her experience was."
35472,"I've spent a long time overcoming what she said about food too, ED recovery is hard."
35473,"It's hard, but I've learned so much."
35474,I love all the moms here and I hope I can be considered one at some point.
35475,I wish I could tell my younger self a few things.
35476,It feels good to talk about it sometimes.
35477,"We can always learn, no matter what."
35478,Just wait until some red item turns your son's white underwear/t-shirt/etc pink (even in cold water)!
35479,You'll learn quickly that you need to sort laundry.
35480,Yep!
35481,"Sitting on the bed works, too."
35482,I hate folding so much that I redesigned my entire laundry process to avoid it.
35483,"Bit more of a pain to execute now, but highly recommend."
35484,We have a 2-story home with laundry room on main floor.
35485,I sat on the bottom step and folded laundry; putting folded piles of different items on the steps on both sides of me.
35486,On the floor?!
35487,Why wash if they’ll just end up on the floor immediately after?
35488,I have seriously never done this.
35489,My mom redesigned the whole spare room to do laundry.
35490,"Comfy couch, coffe table at precisely the right height and a tv straight in front."
35491,She also delegated ironing to me when I was still at home (now it's my dad's task) and after a particularly bad spout of back pain I started sitting while doing it.
35492,We'd usually do it on Saturday evenings and we watched way too much shitty TLC shows while doing so.
35493,It was actually quite fun.
35494,Ok THAT makes sense.
35495,I was picturing y’all putting clean clothes on the floor and being pretty appalled LOL.
35496,"Nah man, you gotta just wash the same set repeatedly so you never have to figure out how to fold em."
35497,Bonus points for constantly forgetting you haven't put them back on when you are ready to go to bed.
35498,I wonder if this is where New Girl got Nick's bath towel line.
35499,That last line killed me.
35500,🤣
35501,"https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Medical-12455-Kitchen-Stool/dp/B002VWJZ1A

You want an adjustable height one."
35502,"Not too aesthetically pleasing admittedly, but  who cares, if you're more comfortable!"
35503,Adjustable stool.
35504,I use a bar-height chair when I need to sit and stir for a long time or I’m working on a project that takes a long time (like icing cookies/cupcakes).
35505,I’ve also seen stools that have a screw-like connection so the height is adjustable by spinning the seat.
35506,"Depending on the setup of your kitchen, you could either open the sink cupboards to give your knees some space or, as I do, sit slightly side-on."
35507,There's no one right answer unfortunately as it depends on your kitchen and the issues you have.
35508,"My biggest problem is with my legs/feet and standing for long periods, so getting weight off them is my biggest priority."
35509,I sit weird but I cross my legs or bring my knees up to my chest
35510,"It’s usually easy to say those motivating, helpful, kind things if you just go by what you need someone else to tell you."
35511,"We aren’t alone in that - we are many, many, many people, and our issues may be different in the detail, but in the end, we all just need some support."
35512,"No I’ll learn not to buy red anymore, that would be easier!"
35513,I recommend colour catchet cloths.
35514,"I use them with every load and I sort no clothes at all - everything I own can bear at least 30C and mild tumbling, so I toss all laundry in, add three sheets, add colour detergent, and done."
35515,That’s it.
35516,"Do a test run first - I had to adjust after some of my hankies got slight spots from jeans, but I really do not care much."
35517,"I wash my white dress shirts with dark purple bedspreads and black socks, no harm done."
35518,Wait we aren't supposed to be doing that?
35519,I've always sat to fold.
35520,What is your process now?
35521,My floors are clean.
35522,But we don't walk with shoes in our home here.
35523,"Honestly, when I had nice carpet, I (and my kids) spent so much time on the floor that in the higher-use areas, I vacuumed daily and cleaned the carpet weekly... and we don't wear shoes in the house..."
35524,"So I really didn't care if the kids folded stuff on the floor then, either."
35525,"These days, though?"
35526,No.
35527,This place seems to be a dust and dirt magnet with its bare floors.
35528,Even daily vacuuming & swiffer mopping isn't enough.
35529,My floors a pretty clean.
35530,Shoes get brushed off and then taken off in my room.
35531,I walk on bare feet or socks all day.
35532,"Tbh, my floor is probably cleaner than my desk - just dust, no snack crumbs and pencil lead pieces, and eraser crumbs…"
35533,"In my bachelor days I would often just throw my comforter on the bed and wrap it around myself like a burrito when the actual sheets were getting crusty, but my wife put the kibosh on that when she started sleeping over because she's not really into sleeping like a hobo."
35534,"I still rotated the pillow cases regularly though, because drool and all the other nastiness that ends up on them."
35535,This means a lot to me.
35536,Thank you.
35537,I recommend colour catcher sheets.
35538,"I get them in supermarkets, maybe other store types would have them where you are - had worked well so far for me - I do exactly one load of laundry: everything, three sheets, and the minimum heat and tumble."
35539,"Clothes come out clean and dry, and yes, hygienic, and I will never ever sort clothes again because Christ almighty do I not have the brain power or time to spare on that"
35540,Maybe I just don’t have enough whites except socks and towels?
35541,Maybe they’re gray and we just don’t notice or care?
35542,"In twenty years I’ve 
Never had an incident with accidentally dying something."
35543,Same possibly.
35544,"But also - I think I have some very small colour spots, but I’m depressed and disabled so I really, really don’t care as long as my laundry is done with minimal work from me"
35545,Congratulations!!
35546,"Wishing you a joyful, supportive pregnancy and beyond and a healthy baby!"
35547,💜
35548,Shut up!

35959,"We’ve told my immediate family and my husbands immediate family, husbands family was amazing my family was …underwhelming to say the least."
35960,But they’ve never been big on sharing emotions so I don’t know why I expected any different this time.
35961,"Dad (my husband) is aware, I can’t keep a secret from him to save my life lol and we are both super excited."
35962,"Got the positive about 9 days after my IUI, this test was later though which is why the line is so dark."
35963,"And I am SOO excited, been trying for over a year and we finally saw a fertility doctor and the first round of treatment worked!"

35974,"Haha, well, biological imperative takes a role in that."
35975,If we weren't into babies we wouldn't want to breed them on a global scale.
35976,Like baby chemistry is in our DNA?
35977,Lol something more sciency sounding than that.
35978,But we love to sniff em n eat feets.
35979,I never thought I'd be into babies til I had them tbh

36052,"Your courage in this moment is not to be played down or taken lightly, and I’m so proud to see you putting yourself and your happiness above the opinions of others."

36070,Someone at my work transitioned after being at the company for a few months.
36071,I remember being absolutely in awe of their bravery.
36072,(This was years ago and no one had transitioned at our small-ish office.)
36073,I was just so happy for her!!!
36074,"I later ended up being interviewed by and working for that amazing, intelligent woman."
36075,"After the offer, we met in person and she finally remembered me (lol!)"
36076,and my kind words years ago.
36077,We kind of bonded after that and I still hold deep respect for her in multiple regards.

36372,I love that they match your shirt.
36373,Is it transphobic to tell you I genuinely still think you look like a girl?
36374,Like I had to go through your profile to see what you meant.
36375,Like unmasking autism?
36376,But I’ve always wondered if it’s transphobic.

36566,"Thank you so much 💓 
It means a lot to hear and know you and so many others have my back"
36567,"Thank you so much, it's probably my hormones but you made me cry in the best way possible 😢😭
(My secret for the nails is that they're very nice press ons haha don't tell!)"
36568,You have to take care of yourself first.
36569,You don’t have to come out to everyone all the time.
36570,"You don’t have to pay a higher price than you can afford, either emotionally or financially if you get fired or treated differently as a result."
36571,"You are allowed to only come out where it is safe, or where you will be celebrated, or never!"
36572,or for any reason at all that is good enough for you.
36573,"If you want, do something that connects you to the real you, like wearing under garments or a pin that only you can see, so that you have a tangible reminder of the truth."
36574,But you aren’t being hypocritical or betraying yourself if you aren’t out everywhere.
36575,Environments and people who are not safe have forfeited the right to be told the truth.
36576,Thank you!
36577,"Although I don't feel courageous, I wanted to tell you that however you end up taking steps towards your goals you are beautiful all the way there :)"
36578,"I love the whole look, I get very mod inspired vibes."
36579,"Nails, hair, top, love it!"

36581,First haircut in a long time I'm happy with haha

36583,The cut suits you!
36584,"Thank you so much for the kind words 💖
My day went great and I'm feeling so thankful I took this step."
36585,I'm thankful too for comments like yours that give me the confidence to keep going
36586,"This made me feel so empowered, I really appreciate your kind heart and it made my day ❤️"
36587,"Thank you for sharing that story, it's really inspiring to hear of people who have transitioned earlier than I have and to feel their successes."
36588,I think you're absolutely right about the importance of being yourself!
36589,"This was so sweet of you to say, I really can't say enough about how that kindness makes me feel."
36590,Thank you!
36591,!
36592,Thank you sis!!
36593,"I guess you'd call this a short to medium bob, it's just long enough for me to comfortably tie it back and I get my fringe cut about an inch and a quarter above my eyebrows."
36594,I'm sure it'd look great on you!
36595,Thanks so much!
36596,"It went great, everyone was very accepting and kind ❤"
36597,This was so heartfelt and genuine that it completely caught me off guard.
36598,"Thank you for the words of encouragement--happiness feels like something in my hands, and that's in part because of the support from amazing people like you"
36599,"Thanks for the kindness, I can tell your niece must be a great person 🥰
I appreciate the encouragement it really has made my day 💝"
36600,Thank you!!!
36601,😭 so many kind comments about my hair I can't help but smile like a dummy ❤

36603,The beautiful miss isabella bennett is the most awesome person in the world!
36604,"I can't speak for everyone but I personally don't take any offense to that at all, it makes me feel great actually :)
Thank you truly for the kind words, it really does mean a lot to me"

36615,I'm really just now getting to the point where I'm starting to see things I like in the mirror and it makes me so happy
36616,"Thank you for this I'm gonna cry fr 😭
Thanks for giving me hope for the future :)"
36617,Thank you!!
36618,"That's so sweet of you, I'm really happy to start exploring a style that feels right on me"
36619,"Ah I see, that is a very good trick😉

And no need to thank me darling, I'm always ready to drop a word of encouragement to my queer children🥰"
36620,Are those the Glamnetic nails?
36621,"If so, how do you like them?"
36622,I've been tempted to try them...
36623,I've been wearing bras for about a week or so since I came out to my family.
36624,Actually at first it was a modified tank top.
36625,"I still  need to do so much, like voice training, and I need to just buzz my head and get a good quality wig while my hair comes back if it does at all."
36626,I'm out to maybe ten people total including myself.
36627,And tons of people on reddit.
36628,Thank you for the support
36629,That was beautifully said and brought a tear to my eyes.
36630,"You are incredibly supportive, and seem like an amazing friend to have."
36631,Thank you so much for being so kind.
36632,That top is so adorable.
36633,"It looks really nice, it frames your face beautifully."
36634,I'm so glad for you!
36635,"This is the first day in a shiny new chapter, I hope you treated yourself to a nice dinner to celebrate it."
36636,You've got this!
36637,I'm so proud and happy for you I'm crying happy tears!
36638,"Any time love, go live your best life, smile big & show the world how amazing you are & don't let anyone rain on you!"
36639,Hope you have another great day xo ❤
36640,"Oh good, thank you, I was afraid of what reddit might think of ""it's a little weird that first day"" but it would be silly to pretend it's not."
36641,"There's only one first day, it's all uphill (or downhill?)"
36642,from there.
36643,You've got this.
36644,"Any time, we are all here to support you!"
36645,"And my niece IS wonderful, and I can tell from your replies that you are a kind hearted, wonderful soul as well  😊

I hope your day went beautifully, with many more ahead of you 😊"
36646,How’d work go?
36647,Good bot.
36648,They totally are!
36649,"I actually love them, they look very high quality in person and they were so easy to apply."
36650,I have had them on about a week and have only had to reapply the thumbnail on my dominant hand.
36651,Very recommended honestly
36652,Question; why buzz your head?
36653,"If it's to wear a wig, you don't need to."
36654,"If it's to grow your hair out, just grow it out."
36655,When you use a decent wig cap (it's like a tight hair net) with your wig you don't need to cut your hair.
36656,Mine is shoulder length and I wear a wig cap and wig no problem.
36657,Is it easier with less hair?
36658,Probably but I'm not noticing much.
36659,"As for ""good quality"", I advise just buying some cheap but good reviewed ones on Amazon."
36660,You can find a good* wig on Amazon for $15 (short wigs) to $25 (long wigs).
36661,"Yes, there are more expensive ones as well."
36662,"I mean, if you have a plan of action, don't think I'm trying to argue with you."
36663,"I just find it easier for me to have a bunch of wigs in various colors and styles rather than one ""forever"" wig."
36664,"❤️



*looks nice, 'hair' realistic like rather than plastic looking, easy enough to brush and style."
36665,It went great!
36666,"Thank you for asking :)
My staff were quick to accept the changes and my colleagues have been great so far ❤"
36667,Ordered!
36668,Thank you so much!
36669,Congratulations!
36670,"I don't know you, or your story, but this art is just beautiful."
36671,Truly.
36672,Sweetie that is lovely!
36673,"I've never seen your work before, but you have a great sense of color and great line control."
36674,If this was in my house it would skip the fridge and go straight to the wall in a proper frame where it belongs.
36675,"Keep up the great work, dear!"
36676,Thank you for thinking of us!
36677,I'm so glad you were able to make art.
36678,"And I agree with the previous 'mom"" - that's a beautiful painting."
36679,"Kiddo, I'm going to ask you to reframe how you told me this."
36680,"You didn't ""only"" make this art this week, you made art this week."
36681,And I'm proud of you for doing it.
36682,You brought beauty into this world.

36686,Thank you for thinking of all of us reddit Moms here.
36687,"I don't know you,  or your story, but I'm proud of you for accomplishing this during this week."
36688,Sibling here!
36689,"I really, really look forward to seeing your posts."
36690,"They make me happy, especially this one since jellyfish are my favorite animals!"
36691,I'll step back from any role and say this is really beautiful and something I would expect to see hanging up in a gallery.
36692,Please keep up your art work you are very talented.
36693,I love this!
36694,"❤️ 

As your mom, everyone would be seeing your art because I couldn't help to show how my talented kiddo!"
36695,Thank you for choosing to make something new and beautiful even during a really hard time.
36696,You took sadness and used it to make something that brought a lot of people joy.
36697,I hope that brings YOU  some comfort.

36699,I’m so glad you posted it.
36700,"Sweetheart, I’d love to know what you were thinking while drawing because I concur with the applause you’re receiving."
36701,"Considering we presently have six astrological planets in retrograde right now, I’m more than impressed and I always like searching for faces and objects I find in artwork."
36702,Looking forward to seeing what you share next and thankful you chose to do so today 🎨✍️💕
36703,It's lovely!
36704,"I am a bit 'jelly' about your artistic talent, kiddo!"
36705,(Does it count as a dad joke if it's by a mom?)
36706,"Aw Peanut,

36715,you are so talented!
36716,"i may not be a mom, but i think i can speak for all of us when i say, i live this so much!"
36717,"edit, i changed u to i.
think it makes a bit more sence ;v;"
36718,*Ooooo* .
36719,. .
36720,I like it!
36721,I love your art.
36722,"You are talented, and I hope you keep hanging in there."
36723,It's beautiful.
36724,I love the blues.
36725,"You're doing a wonderful job, baby."
36726,And not just with your art.
36727,I see your effort.
36728,I'm proud of you.
36729,"Oh, baby!"
36730,This is just wonderful.
36731,It was the first thing I saw when I opened Reddit and I’m so pleased.
36732,Thank you for making this wonderful art — I hope you will keep sharing with us!
36733,"I went back to look at your other stuff and the ridiculous part of me is like ""oh shit."
36734,I love that.
36735,"I bet I could make it, it's just lines and watercolor!"""
36736,But the realistic side of me knows I am not this good and to make all those lines land in the right place takes TALENT and by God you definitely have talent.
36737,These are all beautiful (I especially love the panda and the jellyfish).
36738,Keep it up!
36739,"Oh, look— it's me!"

36758,When you create something it changes your brain a little.

36760,And that makes future creating even easier and more fun.
36761,It's a pretty cool feedback loop.
36762,"But also, when you share something you made, it improves the world."

36908,"Take a step back, reassess, take a breath or 50."
36909,"You got this💯💪 Try not to view this as the ""only thing you did"" instead of the ""one thing that fought to make itself known this wk"" as only art can do."
36910,"Our muses can change up on us, and life can sometimes get us caught up, but don't stop letting your art out."
36911,It's one of the most beautiful things about you.

36916,"I've gotta tell you, as a kid, my dad's best friend would tell the story of him swimming in the ocean and getting stung by jelly fish."
36917,"I was terrified, but since I'm in the middle of a continent, I have a hard time getting near any body of water with jellyfish in it."
36918,"They intrigue and terrify me even today, but this drawing is so lovely."
36919,"(ok, painting?"
36920,My eyes are old).
36921,Thank you for checking in.
36922,"I'm happy that you've had better times to keep you going and didn't need to check in so much, even though this week is a crapper."
36923,"I really identified with the middle child in the Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day book that I read when my kids were little."
36924,(Maybe you know it?)
36925,"Even after all the bad stuff happens to Alexander, and it's not just one bad day either, he says something like ""Some days are just like that, even in Australia"" (where he'd like to escape to)."
36926,I hope you are feeling that feeling tonight.
36927,That some days are just like that but not all of them will be.
36928,Hugs Pickle.
36929,Keep creating beauty in this weary world!
36930,!
36931,"Breaking out, taking off and starting to fly."
36932,It's beautiful.

36936,Glad you made it and shared it
36937,Oh my duckling!
36938,I love the jellyfish!
36939,And never underestimate the power of small steps forward.
36940,You did well this week.
36941,"I love looking at watercolor paintings: the process of it fascinates me, and the patience and ingenuity to make the colors flow from one to another is just lovely."
36942,"Thank you so much for sharing a small piece of yourself: it’s a beautiful painting, and I hope you’re as proud of it as we are of you."
36943,"Good job, sweetie!"
36944,It makes me think of jellyfish and how watching them would be really relaxing.
36945,It's ok that this week was rough.
36946,They can't all be easy and your recovery journey is going to have a lot of stumbling blocks to climb over.
36947,It's ok.
36948,I'm still here and I'm proud of you.
36949,Will you make me something new next week?
36950,Stop using apostrophes when you pluralize shit.
36951,"This is very beautiful, you are so talented."
36952,I'm very proud of you.
36953,"You are smart, you are kind, you are important, and you are loved."
36954,"I really love this, and if it was for sale, I might buy it."
36955,"I love jellyfish, and this is beautiful."
36956,It has a sense of movement and tranquility that is absolutely beautiful.
36957,Keep up the good work honey ❤️
36958,"Gorgeous, hon."
36959,I really like the different shades of blue/grey in the water.
36960,"It’s a melancholy picture- the cool shades, the drifting of the jellyfish, it’s just all very calm."
36961,I love it.
36962,It sounds like you’ve had a rough week.
36963,I’m so sorry.
36964,It’s amazing that even after that you are the kind of person who can look outside themselves and think about what others ( in this case us— lucky us!!)
36965,might like.
36966,Thank you and I hope tomorrow looks up!
36967,"Hey sib, this is absolutely gorgeous."
36968,I am so in love with your work.
36969,Keep it up!
36970,!
36971,I love it!
36972,This is so beautiful!

36975,Oh I love that!
36976,Sweetie this is gorgeous.
36977,You’re so talented.
36978,I love it!
36979,"It's so dynamic, but the watercolours work really well for capturing how jellyfish are."
36980,It's a beautiful piece of art.
36981,I hope next week is better for you.
36982,"Thank you, I have been feeling a little low this week."
36983,"Your beautiful art work gives me hope, and joy."
36984,thank you for sharing.
36985,"What a beautiful artwork, full of so much life and sadness and peace"
36986,Please keep sharing.
36987,I love it
36988,"Love, love, love."
36989,Let me find a frame...
36990,"Hey sis, that’s beautiful."
36991,"I mean, truly."
36992,It caught my eyes and made me stop scrolling.
36993,"Whatever is in you that calls you to create things like this, listen to it."
36994,"Wow, thanks for sharing!"
36995,This is beautiful and I'm so glad I could see it.
36996,Love it!
36997,That is absolutely beautiful!
36998,"I love the blues, and jellyfish are some of my favorite critters!"
36999,I would put it in a frame without a doubt.
37000,I love this so much!
37001,it makes me feel both happy and peaceful!
37002,Thanks for sharing it!
37003,Felly jish
37004,Us Mum’s do count on you - to remind you that you are an amazing artist.

37007,Much love.
37008,"It's beautiful, Lovey!"
37009,Thank you for checking in.
37010,You don't have to feel pressured to create (even though your art is stunning).
37011,"You being okay is always enough, we would be happy knowing you are doing well and can make something beautiful another day."
37012,"I do think your discipline and commitment is an admirable and strong skill to nurture but never feel bad about resting if you find you need it ❤

I'm sorry your week was so rough, I hope you are proud of yourself for pushing through it and creating in spite of it."
37013,I hope this coming week turns out much better.
37014,"Beautiful art, great work!"
37015,That looks so good!
37016,I’m so proud of you for pushing through and creating despite the struggles you face.
37017,I know what it’s like feeling like you can’t create.
37018,"WE LOVE YOU, and your art is BEAUTIFUL!!!!"
37019,!

37039,You are so talented.
37040,❤️
37041,"Oh, how beautiful."
37042,"What do you mean, that’s the “only” thing you’ve made this week?!"
37043,You are an artist—that is not an assembly line 😘 and you created a LOT this week.
37044,Jelly fish?
37045,Water colors?
37046,Beautiful!
37047,"Thank you, I really appreciate it."
37048,Thank you!
37049,I post it once a week.
37050,It helps keep me motivated even during the hard times.
37051,I really appreciate your kind words ❤️
37052,"Thank you, I really appreciate it!"
37053,Thank you so much for this different perspective.
37054,Thank you!
37055,"It's been a really, really hard week."
37056,❤️
37057,I'm so happy I've made your day better today!!
37058,!
37059,Thank you so much.
37060,I truly appreciate your kind words.
37061,This made me cry in the best way.
37062,Thank you.
37063,❤️
37064,Thank you!
37065,"I was feeling very sad, but also very calm... and I just wanted to put that on paper."
37066,I love jellyfish but they also make me feel calm just watching them... and the ocean sad like tears.
37067,That's about as far as I thought.
37068,I wanted to show peace in a sea of tears.
37069,Good job 👍🏻
37070,Good job!
37071,Thanks mom!
37072,❤️😍
37073,"Thank you, I'll try my best!"
37074,Thank you!
37075,That means a lot and I needed to hear that today.
37076,Thanks mom
37077,Thank you!!!!
37078,I will!
37079,I'm happy it made you smile!
37080,Thank you!!!!
37081,You should try it!
37082,I've only been doing any of it for maybe a month now?
37083,I'm just guessing and hoping things turn out okay!
37084,"Trust me there's plenty that didn't, but I just have fun doing it"
37085,What's the watercolour salt technique?
37086,👀
37087,I love kuragehime!
37088,Been years since I watched it though!
37089,Thank you so much.
37090,That means the world.
37091,Thank you!!!!
37092,❤️ truly needed to hear this.
37093,Thank you again.
37094,I really appreciate it.
37095,Thank you so much mom!
37096,"It's my phone doing it automatically with autocorrect, sorry?"
37097,Good to see you!
37098,Keep it up!
37099,Hi.
37100,Yes please continue to post your artwork.
37101,I love what you’ve done here.
37102,"I agree with the other mom, I too would frame this."
37103,Do you have a place to store your work?
37104,Like a closet or anywhere you can slide this in between boxes so it doesn’t wrinkle?
37105,When you get your own place you might want to frame this for yourself.
37106,"Oh, I’m sorry for the hard week, but look what you with and in spite of that."
37107,"Celebrate yourself, sweetheart ❤️"
37108,I really like this painting.
37109,Could you please do a wolf next?
37110,That’s profound.
37111,"Yes,I’m guess the oceans and seas are like tears—even salty."
37112,I think jelly fish are beautiful creatures too—and such a bad reputation!
37113,I’ve never been stung once.
37114,The way the move and propel themselves in the sea is fascinating.
37115,Sea life is all so beautiful.
37116,I wish we’d all globally agree to take better care of the seas.
37117,"That’s where life on this planet began, if I recall correctly."
37118,"We do live on the Water Planet, and tears can be very healing."
37119,That’s what your psinting and your words made me remember.
37120,(I cried a lot this past week too.
37121,I miss my daughter.)
37122,I looked at some of your art in your post history—it is really wonderful!!
37123,Keep it up as long as it feels good to you ❤️ you have such talent
37124,"Any time, honey 💙"
37125,"I usually cover the canvas with water, add the color, then sprinkle salt on it!"
37126,Let it dry and rub the salt off and be surprised what it'll look like :D (though you can sneak peak on google)
37127,Big hugs.
37128,"If what follows is too much, ignore it."
37129,"As a mom and grandma, I sometimes tend to go on and on...  ;)

 I had a mom when I was younger, but not a dad, and I had been much closer to my dad."
37130,Mom was overwhelmed and that made her cruel and she took terrible risks.
37131,"I won't ever get over the dysfunction entirely, but there are some things that definitely helped."
37132,One was taping positive notes \*everywhere\*.
37133,Any place I knew I would see them.
37134,"My desktop computer looked like it had fringe, there were so many scribbled Post-it notes taped to its edges."
37135,I taped encouraging notes to the bathroom mirror.
37136,When someone said something kind to me in email or online I printed it out and saved it in a Smile File.
37137,"Sometimes I took out a few sentences and printed those separately in big, bold font and taped it up."
37138,It was all proof I wasn't a total fuck-up.
37139,"That someone, somewhere believed in me."
37140,The other big thing I did was to find my group.
37141,"People who understood, at least somewhat, where I had been and where I was trying to get to."
37142,People who were trying to put good out into the world.
37143,People who gave me a chance because they didn't know me -- this was the early days of the internet -- and who helped inspire me and helped me do my best.
37144,Some days that group and those affirmative notes were all I had.
37145,If you had asked the people around me they might have been surprised at how dark my thoughts were.
37146,"But none of us really knows how rough our fellow humans have it, right?"
37147,In my case I was hanging out with artists.
37148,"My whole life, I had only known a couple other artists."
37149,This group was amazing.
37150,"Their inspiration, resources, and encouragement helped to put my writing and art together."
37151,I summoned the courage to share what I created.
37152,Then I made books.
37153,Eventually the books sold.
37154,"I could walk into a library or bookstore on the other side of the country (in some cases, in other countries...) and my books were there."
37155,People who I didn't know bought my work.
37156,It was AMAZING.
37157,It reminded me I had ideas worth sharing and the future was going to be better than the past.
37158,A third thing helped: Through my artist friends I figured out I had ADHD.
37159,I was in my 40s...
37160,It suddenly gave me a framework for understanding my own dysfunction.
37161,I wasn't a bad person.
37162,I was just different from my mother and her expectations and the rules of the corporate world.
37163,How are you different from the people around you?
37164,Maybe that is your strength.
37165,Maybe that is something to concentrate on and work with in a creative way.
37166,Maybe it pulls you up -- but it also pulls up others because you had the courage to try first.
37167,We each have a different path.
37168,"I don't know where your path has gone or where it will go, but I know this: None of us deserves to feel unloved."
37169,None of us was born to feel small and disposable.
37170,"We all have strengths and abilities that can lift us, but that can also lift others."
37171,"If you can, get a doctor, therapist, advisor, old teacher, \*someone\* who can help guide you and help you make sense of the rough times."
37172,Sometimes just a few people's wisdom pieced together can explain a lot of what has been missing.
37173,You are not alone.
37174,<3
37175,-hugs- what happened?
37176,"You don't have to answer, btw..."
37177,"I don't want to upset you, but i will give you a hug."
37178,Sea life is amazing.
37179,Do you have Netflix?
37180,"There's a show on Netflix called Moving Art - there's 3 episodes that focus just on the sea - they're just tons of nature footage set to calm meditation music, no narrative."
37181,It's definitely a go to when I need to just feel feelings in a safe place.
37182,The ocean... water in general its the most peaceful and humbling... it is in my opinion the most purest vision of life and like going back to beginning.
37183,Omg that sounds fun!!!!
37184,I'll try that!!
37185,!
37186,Thank you!
37187,I have a similar past so I really appreciate you opening up to me and reminding me there is a path.
37188,Thank you.
37189,❤️
37190,Sounds lovely!
37191,"Thank you : )

Daughter started college!"
37192,"I miss her, but she is on her own life adventure, that's all."
37193,"I'm a passionate advocate of the philiospical stance that parents do not own their children--some behave like that--and I just want that sweet girl to have a happy life (and remember dear ole Ma every so often, of course ; )

&#x200B;

I also cried about some sadness that had been bottled up until I had time."
37194,Having a good cry can be very healing.
37195,"&#x200B;

Thank again so much for the netflix recommendation."
37196,I will check it out.
37197,But you'll promise to keep painting too?
37198,"Of course you will, my love!"
37199,"And if you need to have a good cry, let the ocean tide out \[of your eyes\]."
37200,Water is one of the  most powerful forces on this planet.
37201,xoxo be well sweetheart.
37202,You've got this!!!
37203,We all believe in you.
37204,Please keep updating us.
37205,♡♡♡♡♡
37206,I'm happy to hear that!
37207,I was hoping it was college or a vacation.
37208,I bet she'll do wonderfully at college with such a supportive mom.
37209,"My mom saw me as property and did very wrong things, so it's really nice to be reminded there are parents like you out there who encourage their children to be their own people."
37210,I hope letting out those tears has been soothing for you!
37211,"I'll keep painting, just have had a rough time of many things lately, but I painted today so that's progress right?"
37212,"❤️ thank you for your kindness and support, it means more than you know."
37213,"I love the texture of the 3rd dress, but ultimately, all three are stunning."
37214,It’s going to come down to which one makes you FEEL the best
37215,I love number 3!
37216,The lace is gorgeous but you look stunning in all three!
37217,3rd is amazing on you
37218,All 3 are beautiful!
37219,"The lace dress made me gasp, just gorgeous!"
37220,!
37221,Congratulations!
37222,Each dress conveys a different feeling.
37223,The first is very formal and sexy.
37224,"If your other half wants a white tie wedding, choose that."
37225,"The second is a classic feminine look, chic and universal."
37226,The third is a bit more intricate and  more homey.
37227,But everyone  else's  opinion is not going to be the same as yours.
37228,"If one of these did not bring tears to your eyes or give you an inner thrill, then you haven't  found your dress yet."
37229,"If all three did, the last consideration is comfort of movement."
37230,"You could go in  potato sack and be gorgeous, you know  that,  right?"
37231,So you can't  really go wrong.
37232,This is your day.
37233,Go with your gut.
37234,"Hugs, Auntie J"
37235,#2 has old Hollywood glamor written all over it!
37236,So so beautiful!❤
37237,3rd is my favorite!!
37238,You look stunning in all 3!
37239,Oh honey!
37240,You cannot go wrong with any of them but that first one is really something!
37241,😍
37242,The second one!
37243,Silk!
37244,I love it ❤️
37245,All three are lovely but my vote is for the second one.
37246,Congratulations!
37247,You are radiant in all of them.
37248,Which one made you feel the best?
37249,The 2nd one.
37250,The first won't let you move your arms at the reception and you have to be comfortable all day.
37251,I've worked weddings for years.
37252,The 3rd looks gorgeous on you but isn't as spectacular as the 2nd one.
37253,You're gonna be a beautiful bride honey!!
37254,Enjoy the planning process!!
37255,Congrats!
37256,Number 2 gets my vote!
37257,You look stunning!
37258,💖
37259,"The second one looks like it’s the one that you feel most comfortable and beautiful in, and that confidence comes across."
37260,"I’m so happy to see you happy, sweet girl."
37261,The second one!
37262,You are going to be a beautiful bride.
37263,"I am a sucker for lace so I would have to vote for dress 3, though I really liked dress 2 as well."
37264,"In any case, you look stunning in every one of them."
37265,Congratulations!
37266,First one.
37267,"Sophisticated, timeless, and the most flattering."
37268,Gorgeous!
37269,I really like the first one!
37270,No matter what you choose you're going to look utterly magical hon!
37271,<3
37272,"For me it’s a toss up between the first and the second, maybe leaning a bit more towards the second."
37273,But your face in the last photo is 💕💕💕💕💕
37274,Number 2!
37275,The second one!
37276,You look stunning!
37277,"OMG, you’re stunning in all of them!"
37278,I couldn’t choose if I had to.
37279,Which one do you feel the most comfortable/most like a princess?
37280,That’s the one!
37281,You are so beautiful in each one.
37282,I'm personally partial to lace so I'm going to say 3rd
37283,"Enjoy everything about your day, love."
37284,You have beauty inside and out!
37285, Baby you are GORGEOUS!
37286,I’m so excited for you to choose your vibe and theme and the dress will follow.
37287,Structured and a little more formal?
37288,Bias cut and a little breezy?
37289,Lace and a little boho?
37290,Any way you go it’s going to be amazing!
37291,"Sis here, I love the third one, it's so elegant!"
37292,!
37293,"I'm partial to lace, but both the satin and the lace look great on you."
37294,"Best wishes, dearie ❤"
37295,"You look gorgeous in all three, but the second one is my favorite."
37296,So proud of you!
37297,You look wonderful in all of them.
37298,"I’d go with silk, but whichever you chose you’ll look lovely!"
37299,Number 3 !!
37300,!
37301,"That third dress is gorgeous, but honestly you'll look amazing no matter which dress you choose!"
37302,The second one is absolutely literally breathtaking on you.
37303,I am so excited for you!
37304,Dress number 2!
37305,That shiny charmeuse (if that's the right word?)
37306,"doesn't do most people many favors, because it highlights every little lump and bump, but your figure is so banging - it looks stunning on you!"
37307,"You look absolutely beautiful in them all but the last one shapes your body more and the second one looks incredible on you, which one did you feel most confident in?"
37308,All are beautiful but that second one!
37309,You make it look magnificent
37310,Second!
37311,Dress number 2!
37312,The gorgeous silk one!
37313,"You have great taste, but I think the first one will make it hard to raise your arms all day."
37314,"I'm much more of a texture person, and the second dress looked like it would have felt amazing."
37315,I loved how shiny it was too!
37316,Oh my!
37317,Number 2!
37318,You're such a gorgeous bride!
37319,This silk on the second one!!!
37320,You look gorgeous and I'm sure you and your partner will have a beautiful wedding!
37321,(Let us know which one you choose though I'm invested haha)
37322,The second one is my favorite.
37323,It gives me serious Old Hollywood vibes.
37324,You look amazing in it!
37325,The second one is beautiful and you look stunning in it.
37326,Silk isn’t easy to pull off but you’re doing it effortlessly.
37327,"Congratulations, hope you have a magical day."
37328,All 3 are beautiful on you.
37329,The last one is my favourite on you though.
37330,Cheers and good luck on your wedding day and enjoy a wonderful marriage
37331,You look absolutely stunning and your smile is so genuine in these pictures.
37332,I know you'll have a beautiful day!
37333,I personally vote for the third one.
37334,You should go in the one that makes you feel the most spectacular though!
37335,Which one do you feel wonderful and comfortableish and special in?
37336,Wow.
37337,Just wow.
37338,You look so amazing.
37339,I love them all.
37340,You look stunning.
37341,Which one made you feel amazing.
37342,Which one was comfortable enough to dance all night in?
37343,The first one!
37344,Second or third....though my bias for the second might be because it looks gorgeous with the veil.
37345,"Whichever one you feel best in is the best one, ultimately!"
37346,They all look stunning!
37347,But number 1 has my vote
37348,All are gorgeous on you!
37349,My fav is the second one.
37350,But you can't go wrong with any of them.
37351,The 2nd onw is absolutely gorgeous.
37352,Congratulations ❤
37353,I love all three and they all look stunning on you.
37354,Whichever you choose you are a stunning bride.
37355,Wish you all the best for your future adventure.
37356,"Beautiful in all, but if you’re going to wear the dress during your reception, I would totally pick the lace."
37357,"Won’t wrinkle, easy to breathe and dance."
37358,"Plus, you look like a goddess!"
37359,Congratulations!
37360,The first one absolutely has my vote!!
37361,"Your shoulders are perfect, the waistline and train are flattering, and you are *stunning!!"
37362,*
37363,.......
37364,You can’t go wrong with either two or three.
37365,You’re going to look amazing!
37366,Your smile in the 3rd one ❤️
37367,You are gorgeous in all of them but the third is my favorite!
37368,The lace is amazing!!
37369,!
37370,"Oh darlin', you look beautiful in all of them, but I love that smile on your face in number three!"
37371,I've always been a sucker for lace too.
37372,The trains on all of them are so pretty too!
37373,"No matter which one you pick, you will be lovely on your special day!"
37374,Hey sis!
37375,I think the 2nd and 3rd were beautiful dresses.
37376,"I especially liked the 3rd one, but go with what makes you feel the most beautiful."
37377,Also congrats on your engagement/wedding.
37378,Hello gorgeous !
37379,I would recommend the first one.
37380,The person you are marrying is lucky to have you.
37381,Good luck and lots of good wines to your way ❤️
37382,"Aw poppet... (sniffs, dabs corner of eye...) You look adorable in all of them."
37383,Which one do *you* feel happiest in?
37384,That's the one to get.
37385,"Your lucky, lucky fiancé...!"
37386,❤❤
37387,each of these 3 dresses is a different vibe.
37388,go with whichever you feel calls out to you the most.
37389,a trick I like to do is that I toss a coin between 2 choices and before it lands I'll know which one I was hoping for.
37390,do that twice and you have a winner!
37391,"personally, I don't like the first one as much, but I *really* like the second and third dresses."
37392,"regardless of which you pick, I hope you have a joyous wedding and a fulfilling, prosperous marriage ahead of you!!"
37393,"much love, and congratulations"
37394,You look beautiful in all of them!
37395,"However, it does come down to you and how *you* feel."
37396,I remember when I was trying on wedding dresses.
37397,"I tried on about twenty, and then, I put **the one** on."
37398,"I got overwhelmed and started crying, which surprised me because I am normally pretty unemotional, and I'm not one to care about clothes."
37399,That's how I knew which dress to get.
37400,Not a mom.
37401,I'm a guy that enjoys this sub for all the outpouring of love that it gives.
37402,My wife knows that I've cried more times than I'd like to admit because of things that I've read here.
37403,I don't ever comment here because I'm not a mom and it isn't my place to do so.
37404,This is an exception.
37405,I used to be a banquet manager at a fancy-pants hotel and I've been in charge of more than 100 wedding receptions.
37406,I've seen a lot of things but there's one consistent thing that I tell everyone I know who is getting married.
37407,MAKE SURE YOU TAKE TIME TO EAT.
37408,It's going to be a long day.
37409,It's going to be a blur.
37410,"Friends and family will all want to personally tell you how beautiful you are, congratulations, and maybe hand you an envelope of cash."
37411,You are going to receive so much love.
37412,It's going to be amazing.
37413,But make sure you eat.
37414,I don't know the number of times that I've sent the staff out to clear plates and the bride and groom's plates haven't been touched.
37415,So we leave them and an hour later they still haven't been touched.
37416,The bride and groom are receiving so much love and attention and feel like its impolite to set up boundaries so they can eat the food that they spent so much time picking out.
37417,My advice is to have bridesmaids or groomsmen run point on it and deflect the well wishers for the 20 minutes that it takes to eat a plate of food.
37418,"It's important to eat on such an active, long day."
37419,\- Not a dad but old enough to have kids in college
37420,The first one looks amazing from the back but honestly from the front it I'm not a fan.
37421,You look great but the part around your arms seems off from the front.
37422,I personally like the second one the best because I'm a fan of the satin finish and I don't love how you can see where your slips end in the back of the third one.
37423,"To be clear I'm nit picking to give you an answer, you look great in all of them."
37424,"Oh my Ducking, you’re so beautiful!!"
37425,They all look fabulous on you!
37426,"The lacy one has lovely texture, and the satiny one has wonderful lines."
37427,You will be a beautiful bride in any of these.
37428,Best wishes and all the love.
37429,Congratulations!!
37430,You’ll look beautiful in any one of these dresses.
37431,Stunning 🤩
37432,Either 2 or 3.
37433,The first one makes you look very square and does nothing for your amazing figure.
37434,You glow in the second one but the third flatters your figure the most.
37435,I love the lace one!
37436,I vote #1 or #3.
37437,"The silk one looks like it fits all static-clingy, but there other two look like they did your body better."
37438,"I love the elegance of the first, and the casual feel of the second."
37439,Which so YOU like?
37440,!
37441,Wow!
37442,You look so happy!
37443,"I prefer number 3, but love all the choices!"
37444,Thank you for thinking of me.
37445,"I really like the lacy one on you, but the second one is a close second favorite!"
37446,This mama loves the lace one!
37447,You look fantastic in all of them!
37448,Just love the first one!
37449,"Contemporary, sexy and elegant!"
37450,My vote is for #3 - based on your smile in that last photo!
37451,You are sparkling!
37452,(The low-cut back is also super flattering on you)
37453,Oh my goodness they are all so beautiful and you are radiant in all.
37454,"My personal favorite style is the first, but truly I can’t actually pick one."
37455,Whichever one you feel like a bride in ❤️
37456,the silk one is absolutely ethereal on you 🤩 congratulations bubs!!!
37457,be sure to keep us updated with which you choose <3 so excited and beyond proud of u 🫂
37458,All of them 😍😍😍
37459,You look stunning!
37460,It really is a toss up between one and two for me but as a mom I would want you to pick the one the feels the most like you and makes you feel the most wonderful.
37461,"i think #2 was MADE for you, that silk looks goooooooorgeous!"
37462,!
37463,I love the second one!!
37464,!
37465,"Clearly the third picture, Queen."
37466,You look amazing!
37467,"I personally liked the lace (third) the most, the fabric is beautiful"
37468,I love the 3rd one.
37469,All look great.
37470,I like the last one!
37471,Fits you very well.
37472,"Congratulations, kiddo!"
37473,2
37474,"Whatever you decide, it will be the right choice."
37475,Congratulations.
37476,"You look great in them all, but the second one is is the one."
37477,You also look the happiest in it.
37478,Congrats on your upcoming wedding.
37479,The second one looks JUST like my prom dress but it was teal (and no train)!
37480,I can’t decide between the second or third one!
37481,So excited for you sib!
37482,!
37483,1
37484,Number 2.
37485,You look stunning.
37486,The third is my favorite but you should wear whichever one makes you feel the most beautiful.
37487,"The silk one has something special about it, you just shine!"
37488,"Also you're absolutely beautiful, I hope the best for you and your partner"
37489,"This is a hard choice, they all look amazing on you!"
37490,"I think I have to say the second one, you look stunning!"
37491,Number 2!
37492,Dress 3!
37493,Beautiful!
37494,"Hey sis, to help pic out the dress...

Visualize your wedding day:

Your spouse to be is standing at the end of the aisle, and sees you at the other end."
37495,"Their smile grows larger and they start to tear up, seeing you coming closer."
37496,"You look gorgeous, and are feeling the most beautiful you've ever felt, walking to your beloved."
37497,"You glance down, to make sure you don't trip...

Now, picture what dress you're wearing and feel the best, and most beautiful in."
37498,Pick that dress you see in your vision.
37499,...now I want to know what one you chose.
37500,😊
37501,I'm a daughter in this group but I hope you'll still allow me to vote 😍 second one is STUNNING!
37502,Congrats girl ❤️
37503,#3 is magic.
37504,Just like you baby girl❤️.
37505,Drape neck!
37506,All are absolutely flattering on you just depends on reception/theme
37507,The off shoulder one is stunning but they all are!
37508,My vote is for that one.
37509,You are gorgeous!
37510,Congratulations!
37511,!
37512,I like the second one!
37513,You look gorgeous!
37514,Congratulations!
37515,"You are stunning in all of them, personally I love the first one, it’s such an interesting design, and has a unique feel."
37516,"But at the end of the day, whichever one takes your breath away.❤️"
37517,When is your wedding?
37518,I work in the bridal industry and all three dresses are absolutely stunning but each lends itself to a different season in my mind.
37519,My favorite of the three is the first one because I’ve seen thousands of bridal gowns but have never seen one like that!
37520,It’s breathtaking on you!
37521,2
37522,One
37523,Congratulations sweetheart.
37524,I really like the third one
37525,I love the first one and the third one but you look lovely in ALL of them!
37526,!
37527,The second or the third ones are my favorite.
37528,Leaning towards the third.
37529,They all look great!

37534,The one in the last picture is gorgeous!!
37535,You look stunning in it
37536,You’re beautiful in all of them but I think the first one was made for you.
37537,oh my gosh they are all stunning on you!
37538,"my favorites are 1 and 2. number 1 was my initial reaction with the unique neckline, but number 2 has gorgeous draping and makes you shine with the silk."
37539,"i think I vote for number 2, but you look gorgeous in all of them."
37540,congrats!
37541,xo
37542,You look great in all.
37543,Can pull off all.
37544,#2 has the Carolyn  Bessett Kennedy vibe.
37545,She wore a very similar dress.
37546,"Not a mom but a sister, the second looks amazing on you!!"
37547,The silk looks sooooo beautiful on you and makes you look like a princess.
37548,Plus the back of it shapes you very well.
37549,But no matter what dress you choose you’ll look perfect!
37550,"I'd choose 2 for you, but simply for the fact that I couldn't pull that off and it looks so great!"
37551,Gotta live vicariously 😁
37552,All of them look amazing on you!
37553,But #3 is definitely my favorite!
37554,I'm so happy for you!
37555,"Now, tell me about the special person you're marrying..."
37556,The first and third are my personal favourites but follow your heart!
37557,!
37558,"You look amazing in all of them, so there is no wrong choice here."
37559,But I think you look STUNNING in the first one.
37560,"Congratulations, you should be proud and we’re proud of you too."
37561,#6 looks like it was made for you.
37562,Not α mom but you are absolutely stunning and when I grow older I hope I will look half as beautiful as you!
37563,- a 17 year old!
37564,<3
37565,"All are stunning, but number 3 takes my breath away."
37566,"You are an amazing woman and I am so proud of you, my beautiful daughter."
37567,I wish every happiness for you.
37568,I loveeee the second one!
37569,It's absolutely stunning and is a stand out dress!
37570,I really like the third one as well but I feel like you see this style more often.
37571,The first one doesn't look as comfortable to wear because of the restricted arm movement but I also feel it doesn't flatter your beautiful figure line the other two dresses.
37572,"I love the 3rd on you, but really you should pick ghe one that you can see yourself in on your wedding."
37573,Imagine yourself there and pick the one that feels right.
37574,Congrats on your wedding hun!!!
37575,!
37576,I vote for the second one!
37577,"Hey sis, I love the first one because I love the look of the smooth silhouette with the dramatic off-shoulder; I also like the lace detail on the third one."
37578,Ultimately it's whatever you feel COMFORTABLE and HAPPY in!
37579,I vote for the 6th pic!
37580,Love the detail on that one!
37581,But you rock them all!
37582,TWO!!
37583,!
37584,I vote #3
37585,100% the first one.
37586,Wow!
37587,I love number 2 but to be honest I think you love number 3 judging by your smile!
37588,Go with what you live….and whats comfy!!
37589,!
37590,I love the last one!
37591,Your smile is beaming with that one.
37592,The second one!
37593,"Oh my darling, I'm proud of you and you look beautiful in all of them!"
37594,Which one makes your heart happy?
37595,That's the one you should chose.
37596,"The second one suits you beautifully, I love it!"
37597,!
37598,Number 3 fits you so well and you look immaculate in that lace.
37599,It accentuates your figure while still being simple and flowing.
37600,It is a beautiful dress and makes you absolutely glow!
37601,"All gorgeous,  but I'm  torn between first and last, they are both amazing."
37602,"I think the lace one is stunning on you, but the first one is more elegant."
37603,"The satin one is pretty, but it doesn't  lay quite right on you."
37604,SECOND
37605,"I like the second one better

Edit: The 3rd one."
37606,Congrats!
37607,"I really like the lacy one at the end, sis, but I'm biased."
37608,Mine was lacey :)
37609,I’m with everyone else!
37610,Love the third one 💜💜
37611,"Pic 3 and 4 are the same dress, correct??"
37612,I think so and I absolutely love it!!
37613,"Really, I love them all."
37614,You can't go wrong either way.
37615,"I die for lace, and you look stunning in it."
37616,Number 3 gets my vote.
37617,"❤
Of course, you look amazing in them all!"
37618,You can't go wrong.
37619,Number 2 and 3.
37620,I really like the feel you give off with the first dress and the cut is wonderful on you.
37621,But choose the one you feel like wonderwoman in because this day will be amazing and you can handle anything and will feel like it.
37622,You will look amazing in any of these so ho with your heart.
37623,I love the second and third the best.
37624,They're similar yet so different that it's really your personal preference.
37625,"The first, you look fantastic in - don't get me wrong, you're one of the few who can pull off that style - but to me, it just isn't as wonderful as the other two."
37626,3 stunning dresses and one STUNNER of a bride!
37627,You literally cannot go wrong!
37628,"My vote though goes to #2….VERY Jacquelyn Bisset when she married JFK Jr. That wedding was long ago, but her dress was so elegant in it’s simplicity…and with the veil and the details on the back?"
37629,I’ve never seen that kind of back before!
37630,PS…My girlfriend had a gorgeous lace dress.
37631,"It was soft lace, but by the end of the evening, her arms were pretty irritated underneath from rubbing on it."
37632,Squeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!
37633,I’m so excited for you!!
37634,Please keep us posted!
37635,"So much love, 
Mom"
37636,"First one, it’s a bit more sophisticated and looks great on you"
37637,#3
37638,I reallllly like the first one!!
37639,All three are LOVELY on you :-) and I’m so proud of you!
37640,What a wonderful woman you are!
37641,"💜💜 Thank you so much for including me in your dress shopping — you look radiant and happy — I’m smiling as I write this, thinking of your “big day” and your future."
37642,Much love to you!!!
37643,-Mom 💜
37644,You look stunning in all of them!!
37645,Definitely the second one is *my* favorite.
37646,But whichever one makes you feel like you're glowing💖
37647,I feel like you are highlighting dress 1 and that’s secretly your fav.
37648,I love number 1 because you look so happy and elegant in it!
37649,Congrats sis!
37650,You look great in them all but I reeeeeally love the second.
37651,You look lovely in all of them.
37652,Go with which one makes you happiest.
37653,I don’t think you can go wrong here.
37654,Hey sis I like the 1st!
37655,"I love the first, but think the second is also gorgeous and probably more comfy"
37656,You.
37657,Are.
37658,Radiant.
37659,Absolutely breathtaking.
37660,"All of those dresses look tailor made for you, but I love the last one."
37661,You look so happy!!
37662,Definitely wear that smile!
37663,And I absolutely love no.
37664,2.
37665,Have fun!
37666,!
37667,The second one!
37668,It’s a dream!
37669,"I like the second one best, then the third, then the first."
37670,Just my preference though you look beautiful in all of them!
37671,You are STUNNING.
37672,The second one is my favorite out of all of them.
37673,You are so beautiful in every dress!
37674,You look just beautiful.
37675,I can’t decide!!
37676,!
37677,"I love the lace of the third dress, the back of the second dress and the off the shoulder of the first dress!"
37678,They are all so gorgeous!
37679,I would have to say the first or second one.
37680,You are absolutely stunning!
37681,I love 2 and 3.
37682,So pretty; almost makes me want to get married again.
37683,Almost.
37684,CONGRATULATIONS!
37685,!
37686,3rd photo 👍🏽
37687,The first one.
37688,The off the shoulder look is beautiful!
37689,"Not a mom, but definitely throwing in my vote for #3."
37690,"Might be in the moment thing, but your smile shows you really are feeling yourself in that dress!!"
37691,Congratulations for your big day!
37692,Sweetie you look beautiful in all three.
37693,"As a personal preference I like the middle satin one, but any of them would be magical."
37694,Congratulations on your big day.
37695,The first one is elegant
37696,"I loved 1, then 2"
37697,You're overthinking it.
37698,The second dress is where your heart is.
37699,The first one!
37700,😍
37701,"The second one, just based on the limited photos, seems to flatter you the most so I’d go with number 2."
37702,"But each one is gorgeous and you look amazing in all three so if one of the others looks better or you like it better, go with it."
37703,Edit: just saw you’re having a small wedding.
37704,"So, I still definitely think number 2 because if you ever choose to, you could have it altered to make it wearable at another special occasion; vowel renewal, christening or whatever your traditions are."
37705,Sib here!
37706,"My vote is for 2, it’s so gorgeous and the silk texture makes you look ethereal."
37707,All three are magical!
37708,I like number 2.
37709,I love the style of number one soo much!
37710,It looks beautiful on you.
37711,But you wear the shit out of number two.
37712,It’s stunning.
37713,I think you can’t go wrong.
37714,Which ever one fits the vibe of the wedding more!
37715,The middle one!
37716,"You don't happen to be single, do you?"
37717,You look gorgeous in all 3 - there's no wrong choice here.
37718,But since you asked for my opinion: I vote number 2.
37719,3!!
37720,!
37721,all are beautiful!
37722,my fave is #1 tho :)
37723,"Hi, sib."
37724,I love the second dress so much!
37725,"I don't know if that's silk or satin, but just go with it."
37726,"The first one is my favorite, but you honestly do look gorgeous in all of them."
37727,"2nd or 3rd, you look gorgeous on all of them."
37728,"I would say choose the one that makes you feel beautiful and comfortable at the same time, so you'll enjoy it the most at the wedding."
37729,May both of you love and enjoy each other for many many years!
37730,❤
37731,I love the lace and the back pictured in the fourth photo is stunning!
37732,Oh honey you look absolutely stunning in all of them.
37733,I'm so happy for you!
37734,The third definitely made me tear up!
37735,Number 2!
37736,"I love nr 2, but you look happier about nr 3!"
37737,The lace is very pretty as well.
37738,"All three look gorgeous on you, but I really love the satiny look of #2 and how it hangs so elegantly in the front."
37739,You’re going to look beautiful in your wedding!
37740,I’m all for #1 - incredible!
37741,I like the satin one.
37742,Number 2
37743,Auntie here - all the dresses you picked are gorgeous (and you look phenomenal in them!)
37744,but you look happiest in #3!
37745,How do you feel in the dress
37746,T W O
37747,I love the lace one
37748,The look on your face in the last pic in dress three!
37749,3
37750,I love 3/4 honey.
37751,"But more importantly, which one feels better to move in?"
37752,"Honey, you look beautiful in all of those dresses."
37753,Chose the one you feel like yourself and you are going to shine even more than on those pictures!
37754,I wish you all the best!
37755,Each one was phenomenal and I gasped at each!
37756,!
37757,Number 3 is my favourite.
37758,You look gorgeous in number 2 and 1 as well.
37759,Photo 3 or 4
37760,The look of the 2 fabric is great
37761,The last one has the most elegant touch imo.
37762,The first one.
37763,Classic & elegant
37764,Im more of a sister but I hope that counts!
37765,All 3 look amazing and you look gorgeous in all of them!
37766,"<3  
But if I have to choose, I'd pick the second one!"
37767,"specially due to the shine on the fabric, makes you look absolutely stunning!"
37768,Number 3!
37769,Definitely the last one.
37770,You look so happy
37771,The silk is absolutely gorgeous
37772,You look so beautiful!
37773,"The smile on your face in the third dress tells me you feel beautiful wearing it, but they all look amazing on you!"
37774,my vote is number one but all of them look amazing on you ❤️
37775,Oh my goodness- they’re all gorgeous.
37776,"I really love the first one, you look positively regal!"
37777,"All the dresses are incredible, but as a veteran watcher of ""What Not to Wear"", I would go with the second one."
37778,The higher waist lengthens your legs and does the most justice to your silhouette.
37779,"The first one has a lower waist, which shortens your legs and doesn't show your natural proportions."
37780,"The third dress is gorgeous, but it almost seems like you're swimming in lace."
37781,It's a little too much for your frame.
37782,Sounds like your intuition is leading you to the right one!
37783,"Wow you look amazing I love them all 

I would personally choose 2 but you go with what you want"
37784,Number 2 looks sooooooo good on you 😭 you’re the bride of dreams!
37785,Number 3 is maybe more classic and I agree with the other commenters- the lace is stunning!
37786,"But ultimately I like n. 2 better, I think it compliments your figure perfectly and it’s an unique style."
37787,Which is your favourite?
37788,Wishing you all the love and happiness in the world 🤍
37789,First one looks absolutely gorgeous on you!
37790,One or two.
37791,You look so freakin cute and happy 😍😁
37792,2nd dress looked like it was made for you!!
37793,"I didnt like the cut of the first dress, and third dress had interesting texture."
37794,The 3rd one has my vote.
37795,The 2nd one could  make a nice reception dress.
37796,Ohh myyy ….. You look gorgeous in any of that!
37797,"I love the first one on you tho, so elegant"
37798,Any looks stunning on you.
37799,But second one has my heart.
37800,I can't believe I'm not seeing as many votes for dress 1!
37801,It looks timeless
37802,Second.
37803,Looks so good from behind especially how shiny the material is.
37804,pic 3 is stunning
37805,the 3rd one is gorgeous!!!
37806,but honestly all of them are beautiful so just go with which one makes you feel the best 🥰!!!!!!!!
37807,congrats on the wedding!
37808,🎉❤️❤️❤️❤️
37809,"I love the 3rd most, although the second is amazing also!"
37810,I push for the 3rd also because I feel in the years to come it will never look “dated” it’s beautiful and your beautiful!
37811,I wish for you a wonderful happy marriage!
37812,I vote on the third one
37813,2nd pic spaghetti strap.
37814,Beautiful
37815,Number one is very very elegant
37816,You look amazing in all of them!
37817,I love the third one  though ❤️
37818,i love the silhouette and material of the second one!
37819,i also am super into the neckline/sleeves of the first.
37820,you look gorgeous in all of them.
37821,i like the long trains that they all have.
37822,"You are so pretty, OMG!!"
37823,I like the first one.
37824,"Seriously, you are very pretty 🤩"
37825,The second one.
37826,It’s giving Ariana grande vibes and I love it
37827,Number 1 oh my gosh my jaw dropped!
37828,You look amazing sweetie!
37829,I would choose a dress that has straps on the shoulders simply so that your not having to adjust constantly.
37830,"Regardless, whatever you choose will be stunning"
37831,You look beautiful in all of them!
37832,Personally I love lace so no.
37833,3 would be my top choice but do whatever makes you happy and comfortable!
37834,Xx
37835,Oh my god you look stunning
37836,I’m really surprised by the comments.
37837,Thought everyone would go for the 2nd one.
37838,It’s so pretty
37839,I loved the silk one!
37840,But in my experience it's the one that you look and feel: that's it
37841,The second one looks so effortlessly chic and feminine!
37842,Wow!
37843,I LOVED it on you!
37844,"The 4th picture looks like a painting, stunning!"
37845,And the fabric has a great shine
37846,The silky one !
37847,Wow ♥️
37848,You want my opinion baby?
37849,"Alright, here goes!"
37850,You could wear a potato sack and still be stunning.
37851,You're inner beauty shines like a million stars in the night sky!
37852,"Clearly you look picture perfect in all three, but only YOU know which one to choose."
37853,"I see a confident, resilient, gentle woman before me."
37854,Pick the dress that makes you feel the most like that.
37855,Sending love and wedded bliss!!
37856,Mom.
37857,You look gorgeous in all of them!
37858,"😍 I personally prefer the 3rd one, but it may depend on the general theme/decor of your wedding."
37859,I love the neckline of the second one on you as well.
37860,Am I allowed input even though I'm male?
37861,First looks very pretty on you
37862,Is that a bridal shop in a renovated church?!
37863,How smart?!
37864,Also I’d go with 2
37865,First or second!
37866,"The first is classic and timeless, so beautifully cut."
37867,The second looks like you're wearing a pool of silver moonlight and flows beautifully.
37868,"3 is gorgeous but you’re one of very few that can rock number 2, so I’m leaning that way."
37869,:)
37870,Honey you are rocking every one of those dresses!
37871,The third one is my favorite personally but whichever one you choose you will be beautiful!
37872,You look amazing in all...but 3 is it.
37873,You look absolutely stunning in all of them!
37874,I love lace so would probably choose the third but that's just me!
37875,"The first and third are my favorites, but I hope that whichever dress you choose, you feel gorgeous in it!"
37876,The last one for sure!!
37877,You are beautiful BTW.
37878,You look gorgeous in all three!
37879,I'm between 2 and 3.
37880,"Ultimately, 2 would be my choice because 3 would get caught on everything."
37881,Congratulations!
37882,2 is absolutely divine on you!
37883,First one!
37884,Absolutely.
37885,Elegant and individual.
37886,Perfect.
37887,I'm not a mom but you look absolutely amazing in all of them
37888,"I’m a gay dude, so I’ll say this with my best queer judgement lol, but I love the first one."
37889,"I love the silky satin-y texture, I love the off the shoulder moment, and I love how elegant it makes you look."
37890,"That being said, all three are stunning!"
37891,I love the 2nd on you the most.
37892,But all 3 are gorgeous
37893,I love the first one because of the cold shoulder sleeves but I absolutely adore the flowing elegance of the second one!
37894,"Whichever one you pick, you’ll look absolutely stunning on your big day!"
37895,I hope you have a wonderful wedding with your partner and I hope you feel loved and cherished every single day.
37896,the last one!
37897,You look Gorgeous!!
37898,!
37899,The second looks so amazing on you!
37900,You look stunning in all three and your joy is simply radiating.
37901,Personally the third (beautiful lace one) would be my choice simply because it seems like it would be the easiest to move around in comfortably and the most forgiving in photos if you’re lucky enough to enjoy your own wedding food and drink.
37902,"You look stunning in all, Darling Daughter, but the second shiny one is the one!"
37903,I’m so proud of you.
37904,Remember that I will be with you in heart and spirit on your special day.
37905,I love the lacy one!
37906,"4,5,1,6,2,3"
37907,I’m absolutely in love with the second one.
37908,Good luck!
37909,I love the silk looking dress.
37910,It drapes over you so nicely and compliments your figure.
37911,"At the end of the day though, you look beautiful in all 3 so whatever makes you feel best."
37912,Congrats sweetie.
37913,I love #3 but you are a beautiful woman and all three look amazing.
37914,I love them all.
37915,You look stunning!
37916,But to me you seem happiest in showstopper number 1!
37917,My mom told me when I tried tried on my wedding dresses that she wasn’t going to give a big reaction to any of them at first.
37918,She would wait and give the biggest reaction to the one that made me smile the biggest.
37919,I have always loved that and wanted to pass it on
37920,4th one!!
37921,(the one on the 4th pic)
37922,Last one!
37923,Stunning Angel!
37924,I love 3 most of all!
37925,Sending love and fulfillment of hearts desires to you and your family 💞
37926,I wish I could mix the elegance of the top of the first one and the texture/train of the third.
37927,I’d go with whatever you feel most comfortable in though!
37928,-sister
37929,"Number 3 has my vote, it's beautiful and you look amazingly gorgeous in it and so happy!"
37930,I adore the third one on you!!
37931,"But I may be a little biased, I love anything with lace haha and your smile kind of says it all!"
37932,When my younger sister was wedding dress shopping and tried on her dress she had the same smile
37933,The second one looks amazing on you!
37934,"If the second one is your favourite, then it’s my favourite too."
37935,I wish I could see your smile in that one - I bet it’s radiant.
37936,Number 3 is my favorite but you look stunning in all of them darling
37937,Third dress is stunning on you
37938,Number 2 is incredibly striking!!
37939,That’s my vote.
37940,Hey sis!
37941,Congrats on taking this big step in your life.
37942,Marriage is very rewarding.
37943,"I personally love dress number two, but you look stunning in all 3."
37944,DEFINITELY the dress in pics 3 and 4.
37945,"OMG, you look like a sophisticated, graceful,  and beautiful goddess in that dress!"
37946,!
37947,"Sweet child, you're beautiful in each of them."
37948,"Whichever makes you feel best, you'll have a team of moms cheering for you!"
37949,I do think the lace reflects the beauty and elegance of who you have become.
37950,"I personally love the first and third ones, but do whichever one makes you feel best!!"
37951,And let us know which one you pick!
37952,The second dress is the best one for you.
37953,That fabric is luscious and the cut is practice as well as flattering.
37954,You really bring Number three to life!
37955,"All are beautiful, I’m most partial to the second one!"
37956,That shine is stunning on you.
37957,The lacy 3rd dress is also lovely.
37958,2
37959,"I love the second one myself, honey."
37960,You look lovely in all of them!
37961,I’m so happy for you.
37962,I'm torn between number 2 and 3 but you look gorgeous in all of them 😍❤️
37963,Number 3!
37964,You’re absolutely gorgeous in it❤️
37965,You look absolutely stunning in any of them.
37966,You should be proud of who you are and who you're becoming.
37967,Your partner is a very lucky person.
37968,Congratulations on the upcoming wedding!!
37969,❤
37970,Hi sis!
37971,I think the first and the third are stunning.
37972,The second is okay but a bit lingerie like!?
37973,Idk.
37974,But you're beautiful and I'm so happy you're getting married.
37975,Stunning.
37976,"Honey, I’m so happy you came to us for opinions."
37977,It genuinely made my day.
37978,I will join the chorus and vote for the third one.
37979,"So proud and happy for you, wishing you all the happiness and fun on your big day!"
37980,Oh honey you look beautiful!
37981,"I love all three - you’d be fantastic walking down the aisle in a bin bag, of course, but these are all so wonderful."
37982,"Pick whichever you feel happiest in, because each of them makes you look divine."
37983,All 3 totally work with your frame.
37984,My personal favorite is the 3rd one.
37985,The flower designs are so elegant.
37986,"For the record, you are ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!"
37987,Congratulations on your big day!
37988,💜
37989,"I'm adding my vote for the first one, matching an amazing giant necklace with it would look stunning."
37990,And it's my favorite back too.
37991,But whichever you choose you look beautiful!
37992,You look absolutely stunning in all 3 but particularly in 3 or 1.
37993,Go with the one which makes your heart sing sweetie and your happiness will shine through ♥️
37994,Love them all!
37995,"Don't just think about the ceremony though, think about the entire day."
37996,"Will you be comfortable in one more than another while dancing, eating, etc.?"
37997,"You'll be stunning no matter which one you pick, but in my experience, being comfortable at the end of a long day is something to consider."
37998,Congratulations to you!
37999,EtA:.
38000,Do something fun like walk around the park or go out to dinner all dressed up (just read that you're having a small civil ceremony).
38001,It's so much fun to have random people congratulate you and tell you how wonderful you look.
38002,Source: Husband and I were married in Vegas and had a blast walking around all dressed up.
38003,"I love love love all of them, but #2 gets my vote!"
38004,"There's something about it, I can't quite put my finger on what it is, but it just feels like the right dress."
38005,"But in the end, choose the one that makes *you* feel the happiest!"
38006,The second one is absolutely amazing !
38007,!
38008,Love the first one.
38009,So proud of you!
38010,Sis that silk one is stunning on you!
38011,I’ve always wanted to rock a silk dress like you do.
38012,Congratulations!
38013,Number 3.
38014,As soon as I saw it I started to tear up.
38015,You're going to make a gorgeous bride.
38016,Sweet girl you are absolutely gorgeous in all 3 but you had a glint in your eye when you were wearing the lace dress!
38017,3/4!
38018,!
38019,"The silky one, definitely"
38020,"Okay, so, rule #1: No telling a bride which to pick!"
38021,"Instead, I'm going to ask you:

\- Which one gave you happy wiggles and dances?"
38022,Because that's the one that you're excited and having fun in.
38023,"\- When you imagine your photos, what kind of dress do you see in them?"
38024,"When you imagine dancing that night, which one can you see grooving and shaking in (dancing, I mean dancing :P) all night long?"
38025,Which dress do you see your partner looking at as you walk down the aisle?
38026,"\- For a lot of people, this is the first and only Very, Very Formal dress they'll ever buy for themselves."
38027,Is it important to you that the dress be uniquely formal (something you'll never find off-rack under any circumstances)?
38028,"If it is, pick the dress that lets you best live the fanciest day of your life in the fanciest duds of your life."
38029,"And a few practical considerations:

\- How much does it matter if someone will have to help you do things like pee?"
38030,"If the answer is ""a lot."
38031,"That sounds horrible"" then go for whichever dress you can best manage on your own."
38032,\- You have a few off-the-shoulder options: One thing to consider is how much you want to worry about your tater tots unexpectedly putting on a show.
38033,"That's not to say it's likely to happen (these things are tailored to an inch of their life), but if you're a worrier it'll keep you distracted."
38034,And no one wants to worry about that stuff all night long.
38035,\- Check the underarms.
38036,Are your arms rubbing on any kind of beaded or lace material?
38037,"That can cause a lot of irritation through the day, so keep that in mind if it's something you don't want to deal with."
38038,I like number one!
38039,Classy but also very chic
38040,Second for sure!!!
38041,it’s so unique.
38042,The silk one.
38043,Hey sweetie!
38044,I remember trying on my wedding dress and the moment I saw it on I knew.
38045,"It's such a special day

I personally would go with #3."
38046,"The lace over lay is so so so pretty, and its such a classic bridal look that it would fit any sort of theme or not theme you might have."
38047,"Also, your face is beaming in #3."
38048,The other two pictures you look kind of like you're picking produce at the store.
38049,Go with 3!
38050,Congratulations also on your big big day!
38051,You could wear a potato sack and still be the most beautiful bride I have ever seen.
38052,"I loved them all, though I think it’s between #2 and #3."
38053,But it’s your day.
38054,Which one makes you feel the most like a bride?
38055,"I'm absolutely in love with dress 3, but this is YOUR day."
38056,You pick what makes you happiest.
38057,I hope your partner is a forever and always!
38058,and if they aren't mom will be here to wrap you in a warm blanket and a bowl of ice cream consolation.
38059,3rd one is good
38060,"Not a mom here, just another kid, but let me tell you sis, you look gorgeous in all three."
38061,"If i had to choose one anyways, I'd go with first."
38062,It just.. fits perfectly.
38063,"Second doesn't really feel like you, that's the feeling it gives."
38064,"Third is really nice too, I like it, but doesn't give the ""THIS IS THE ONE"" vibes like the first."
38065,"Although your smile is the best in the third, my opinion aside maybe you should choose that one, after all you will wear it!"
38066,":)


Regardless which one you choose, I'm happy for you, and wish you all the best in life!"
38067,:)
38068,"You should choose whichever one makes you feel like the best, most confident version of yourself."
38069,"Personally, I like option 1."
38070,"But that's because I always choose the cleanest (visually), sleekest look and I think the top of that one gives such classic, understated drama to the dress."
38071,All 3 look wonderful on you though so any of them would be a stunning choice.
38072,\#1Bit Adams Family bvibes
38073,I like the 3rd one
38074,3 hunny it makes me and you blossom

38079,They are all differently beautiful and look amazing on you.

38083,"I like the elegance of the first dress, but I think you already know that the third dress is the right one for you."
38084,"Your smile was so big, dear, but whichever dress you pick, you’re going to look beautiful in, they all look so gorgeous on you."
38085,The third one with the lace.

38093,Second dress.
38094,I wish I could see your face in all the pictures.
38095,"But going by the look on your face, the last dress."
38096,Your smile and just whole expression in that one makes it the winner.
38097,All 3 look lovely on you.
38098,I'm a sucker for an almost architectural style dress when it enhances the wearer.
38099,So dress #1 would be my pick if your faces glows like I saw in dress #3.
38100,#1 is my favorite but they all look awesome
38101,I can't decide between 2 or 3.
38102,"I love the look of 2 on you, but I love the texture of 3."
38103,"Either way, you're going to be beautiful!"
38104,Dad says #1.
38105,"You look so beautiful, honey, in all three!"
38106,"I have a slight preference for the first dress, but I would never boss you around."
38107,Please choose the one that gives you the most joy!
38108,It's the huge smile on your face in the third dress that does it for me!!!
38109,Congratulations!
38110,!
38111,you look gorgeous.
38112,"I like all of them, maybe the first one most for me personally but it could be bias since it's the first one I saw."
38113,Either way congrats to you sis!
38114,"Love, I can't decide, all look so stunning on you."
38115,However I love the first one!

38176,these are all so beautiful!
38177,"the back of the first one is 👌, and the second is so graceful, but i have to go with the third one."
38178,it’s so flattering on you and looks like you’d wear it in a magical forest or field of lavender at twilight!
38179,it also looks like it’s from the princess bride or something hehe
38180,Big sis here - you have an exquisite figure so even a burlap bag would look good on you.
38181,All 3 are beautiful dresses.
38182,Have you tried walking up stairs or sitting down in them?
38183,You'll be wearing the dress for a few hours at least.
38184,I don't want you to be uncomfortable.
38185,the first one is gorgeous!!!!
38186,I mean they’re all pretty but I’m 100% rooting for the first one.
38187,But you take the dress that makes you feel the best!

38213,❤
38214,1 or 3
38215,I am torn between number two (which you look amazing in) and number three (which you look amazing in).
38216,I think I may like two the best but you can't go wrong with either of those options!
38217,Definitely 2.
38218,All 3 are nice but 2 fits you the best and is elegant and sexy.
38219,1 puts all the focus on your shoulders and chest; 3 puts all the focus on the rear.
38220,2 is just right!

38228,That is the dress I would want you to have.
38229,"All of those dresses are stunning on you, no question about that, but you're only going to be standing still and looking your best (like you were in the mirror) for some of the time."
38230,"The rest of your day will be filled with movement, hugs, sitting and standing, getting dipped, dancing, and all sorts of movement."

38304,Not a mom bt that last one is stunning
38305,#5 and 6 love the design!
38306,\#3 ❣️
38307,"You’re gorgeous in all of them, but that third dress looks like it was made for you!"
38308,You also seem much more at ease in it compared to the others.
38309,"At the end of the day though, wear what makes you feel the best, no matter what others say."
38310,"I was married in sea green despite lots of family drama for my choice, and I still look back fondly on my wedding dress because it made me feel beautiful."
38311,All I want is for you to have the same feelings about your dress in 15-20 years.
38312,You look absolutely beautiful in all 3.
38313,You are going to make a stunning bride!
38314,Which of the dresses do you feel the best in?
38315,That is the one that I would encourage you to choose.
38316,I adored the train on the second one!
38317,"The neckline on that one isn’t my favorite, but you pulled it off beautifully!"
38318,"Oh honey, they are all beautiful, just like you!"
38319,"I like the first one best because of the button details, but all of them stunning, and any would be an excellent choice."
38320,Wow.
38321,"You have the figure to pull any of these off, but have to agree no 3 is beautiful."
38322,Pretty and on the right side of sexy.
38323,Lace is a lovely design so balanced traditional with modern.
38324,I’d go dress shopping somewhere else and then come back and see how it feels to get back in to the dress.
38325,"If you don’t want to take it off, it’s the one."
38326,Congratulations you will be the most stunning bride.
38327,I wish you much love and laughter in your life with your partner.
38328,All of them you look stunning in :)
38329,Number 5
38330,1 and 2 are my favorite but it all depends on you and how you feel in them!
38331,!
38332,#3
38333,I'm probably bias because it looks very similar to the dress I wore to my ceremony but I say number 2!!
38334,I loved it when I wore it because it was so comfortable but still felt very romantic and glamorous.
38335,The second one looks beautiful on you.
38336,You look most elegant in that one.
38337,Your face in the last one makes me think that's it.
38338,Number 2
38339,Silk!
38340,!
38341,I personally love the third dress.
38342,It enhances your figure and we can see your face looking at the dress.
38343,You look excited and immensely happy.
38344,You would look beautiful in any of them but I especially love the lace train
38345,It really depends on what theme you and your partner want.
38346,"If you’re going for something more chic and formal, go for the first one."
38347,"The second one is fun, sexy, and goes great with a more upbeat, dancing kind of energy."
38348,"The third one is the best for a cozy, modest theme."
38349,"It’s all up to you, darling!"
38350,You look stunning no matter what you wear :) ❤️

38355,3 is my favorite

38357,You'd rock any of them though.
38358,😁
38359,All of these gowns fit you amazingly and seem as though they were designed for you by the designers!!!
38360,"All of them are extremely lovely , I wish you could wear all three."
38361,"Number two is sticking out so much to me , you look fabulous in all  three."
38362,Hi!
38363,I think they all look great!
38364,My gf who has much more taste than I do says 1 seems more formal wedding while 2 and 3 seem slightly less so (not in a bad way!).
38365,I personally think 1 looks nicest.
38366,"She agrees, with two as a second choice."
38367,"She also thinks you look happiest in the first one, but only you can know that for sure!"
38368,Oh my god sis you look AMAZING!!!
38369,As someone that worked in bridal for two years I always longed for the brides I work with check them selves out the way you are in that 3rd picture.
38370,All three dresses are stunning and the smile you have in two and three is exactly the kind reaction you want.
38371,You can’t go wrong here but that second dress had you feeling some type of way and it shows!
38372,🔥🙌🏻👰🏻‍♀️
38373,You are a beautiful bride!
38374,My personal favorite is number 2.
38375,I think it's the most flattering and the back is stunning.
38376,"But whatever you choose my dear, you will be a gorgeous bride!"
38377,I vote for #2.
38378,"Best combo of classy, sexy, sultry, with a splash of that royal queen of your home to be look"
38379,"The 2nd dress is amazing, you look stunning in it"
38380,You look lovely in all of them but I think the 2nd one just sings on you!
38381,"I would not want to make a decision if I was you, because all are stunning in it’s own way, you are looking beautiful in all three of them!"
38382,But my fav is the second one :)
38383,hey sis!
38384,omg you look so beautiful just trying them on.
38385,all three are beautiful :) hopefully we can see how stunning you look day of!
38386,They all look great on you but number 3 looks best
38387,You look beautiful in all of them!!!!
38388,I like the first one though
38389,"Speaking as a sister, you look phenomenal in all of em (that’s not helpful I know lol)"
38390, I LOVE #1 and # 2!
38391,Need more pics!
38392,"But as others have said, it's the one that makes YOU feel the best!"
38393,I love the first one!!
38394,!
38395,the first one is stunning and unique but it's all up to how you feel in each dress and what you're going for
38396,You look STUNNING!!!
38397,!
38398,I think you look amazing in both 2 and 3.
38399,"My personal favorite is 2, but only because I'm not a fan of lace."
38400,"But the lace looked amazing on you, and if it felt right, then go for it."
38401,Another vote for number 3.
38402,You look stunning!
38403,"Also, those lace roses are just beautiful."
38404,"Congratulations, sis!"
38405,🤗
38406,The first one is very classy-elegant.
38407,It is Stunning.
38408,"The back, more so than the front."
38409,The 2nd one is very pretty - soft... more romantic... and the back with the veil is just Beautiful & lovely.
38410,The third one is pretty...  but unless You feel like it is the dress — I would choose between 1 or 2.
38411,Do you want more classy?
38412,Or...
38413,Romantic with a little sexy...?
38414,"You are absolutely gorgeous in all three, so, my dear, you CANNOT go wrong."
38415,Which one do YOU feel the best and most comfortable in??
38416,❤️💖❤️
38417,"I'm terrible at choosing, but all three are gorgeous!"
38418,#3 for sure.
38419,"On #1, the material looks too heavy and makes you look like you have no boobs."
38420,#2 style is nice but the material doesn't look as nice.
38421,#3 looks like it was made for you.
38422,"The texture of the third dress is my favourite, although all three are gorgeous."
38423,It'll come down to which one makes you feel the most comfortable.
38424,You are so lovely in them all!
38425,Pick the one that makes you zing!
38426,with joy.
38427,"In the photos, your delighted face in the lace dress suggests that's the one... Is it?"
38428,You look gorgeous!
38429,I like the second one best but all three are beautiful.
38430,Congrats!
38431,"The last one with the lace is gorgeous on you but honey, you choose."
38432,You're beautiful in all of them.
38433,It’s your smile on number three that does it for me!
38434,You look stunning in all of them but number 3 is my favourite for how happy you look in it :)
38435,W
38436,First two gives your ass a coof
38437,I love how well you animated the big stretch.
38438,Very cat-like.
38439,UPDATE: thank you so much for all your positive feedback!
38440,This community is so loving and supportive and I’m so appreciative for every one of you.
38441,I read some comments about not seeing my face or reactions to dress 1 or 2 and I definitely have some photos where my face is very revealing to which I felt the best in lol.
38442,If you’re curious I put some of the other photos of the dresses [here!
38443,](https://laurencportfolio.com/wedding-dresses-cont/)

38451,Wow you gasped?
38452,Thank you!!!
38453,I love that lace
38454,Thank you!!
38455,"Yes, I’m glad you picked up on them having distinctly different feelings."
38456,I’m very open to different styles and wanted to try many different vibes out.
38457,"My fiancé and I are having a small City Hall ceremony so I kind of felt like the second one made the most sense because it’s unique and comfortable, while also not being too over the top."
38458,"It’s interesting you talk about being brought to tears because I thought I would be for sure, but I wasn’t."
38459,I want to say it’s because my mom wasn’t there.
38460,But I’m not sure.
38461,Thank you so much for your support Auntie J 🤍🥰
38462,Right?!
38463,Old Hollywood with a modern twist in a way.

38480,😍 the second one made me feel so easily beautiful
38481,That’s true about the restriction in the arms.
38482,"Although I will say, we’re having a small City Hall ceremony so I won’t have to worry about a crazy reception."
38483,I always thought I’d have a super planned out wedding but since parting ways with my family have come to realize I much prefer a ceremony that’s more about my fiancé and I.
38484,But I will still be planning plenty!!
38485,Lol thank you so much!
38486,!
38487,Thank you!!
38488,🤍🤍

38510,This made me so happy!
38511,Thank you!!
38512,🤍🥰
38513,Aww thank you!!
38514,My fiancé and I are having a small City Hall ceremony probably with just our best friends so I’m thinking I’ll go with the one I feel most comfortable in and that’s definitely the second one I’d say 😊🤍
38515,"that was my thought about the arms, as pretty as it is"
38516,Thank you so much 😊😊
38517,I was just so happy to have made it to this point of loving my partner and knowing so truly that marriage is what I want and marriage with *him*.
38518,I couldn’t hold my joy in.
38519,"I feel most myself in the second one, but the more I look at photos of the other dresses the more I see to love in the others too!"

38526,Thank you so much ✨🥰😍
38527,"This made me smile, thank you so so much ☺️❤️"
38528,"I teared up visualizing walking to my man down the aisle, and I truly know he’ll see me as his one and only in anything I wear."
38529,"I think I the most sexy, and effortless, and beautiful in the second, silky one."
38530,I feel like my own woman
38531,"Everything about our wedding is completely undecided so far, but we want a small City Hall ceremony with our best friends."
38532,"I know my fiancé doesn’t care when, so I’ll get to pick that and I would love it to be in the fall."
38533,I’m so excited you commented and said that the first one is like nothing you’ve seen!

38564,Thank you!
38565,!
38566,"Thank you, sis."
38567,I really believe I’ve found the man and have a love exactly like the one you described.

38573,"I had a friend at the appointment, but have felt very lonely recently and have had a hard time celebrating myself."

38584,Looks like dress 2 is the winner to me.
38585,You’re gorgeous in them all and your fiancé is sure to fall even more in love at the sight of you in any of them- congratulations!
38586,!
38587,Your smile is huge in the 3rd picture and it just so happens that’s my favorite but I love them all.
38588,You’re going to make the most beautiful bride!
38589,!
38590,"Yep, I was about to say, the third one."
38591,LOVE THE LACE!!
38592,!
38593,I love the fit of the 3rd dress as well.
38594,You look stunning ♥️
38595,You look so happy in that one and it is gorgeous on you!!
38596,I hope your big day (and your marriage!)
38597,are everything you ever dreamed of ❤️
38598,Both the lace and the color look stunning on your skin and fit you like a glove.
38599,<33
38600,Your expression with the third dress makes me want to recommend that one!
38601,Maybe the pictures didn’t properly capture your feelings but you glow in the third one!
38602,"Also, the texture and fit of the third one makes it look like it was made for you."
38603,It definitely does.
38604,Your smile is very radiant in it.
38605,Third was my fav
38606,"o, it does, so much."
38607,the first one’s been done.
38608,"but the third, wow."
38609,The lace dress truly gave me a tear in my eye :) I love them all.
38610,"3 is my favourite, but do you have a favourite?"
38611,Or one that you’re leaning towards?
38612,You genuinely can’t go wrong with any of them.
38613,"But my advice is to not worry too much about what’s appropriate for a City Hall wedding, and focus on what you want to wear to *your* wedding."
38614,"I’m in a few wedding subreddits, so I’ve seen many people post about their City Hall weddings."
38615,"Some people wear casual white dresses, some don’t bother with a wedding dress at all, and some wear dramatic over-the-top ball gowns!"
38616,The decision really is up to you.
38617,2nd one!!
38618,!
38619,I love the second one.
38620,It has a very very classic look that is absolutely timeless.
38621,They are all gorgeous and you are stunning!
38622,Congratulations on your marriage and best wishes <3
38623,Another vote for dress number 2!
38624,So pretty!
38625,"Although they are all gorgeous, and so are you :)"
38626,I came here to say the same thing!
38627,"Love the old Hollywood vibes, and I feel like silk or silk-like materials have been really in style as of late."
38628,"But, as everyone else stated before me, you look absolutely breathtaking in all 3 dresses!"
38629,"Two all the way, Grace Kelly vibes."
38630,Super glamorous!
38631,❤
38632,"Yes, the second one is very romantic!"
38633,It looks fabulous on you
38634,"Hey Sib, hard agree!"
38635,That one looks awesome
38636,You were glowing in it and it really suits you!
38637,Do your favorite.
38638,You are gorgeous in all of them.
38639,Me and my 5 year old (who *should* be asleep) agree!
38640,It's shiny and beautiful!
38641,That’s the answer then!
38642,Choose the second one.
38643,It’s mine too!
38644,You’re going to be a beautiful bride :) I wish you and your intended many happy years together
38645,I think it’s the most timeless as well.
38646,I came here to say 2nd!
38647,"So few people can pull off that style, but you look incredible!"
38648,!
38649,"I actually said ""good god"" in my head, this is *the* dress!"
38650,Was honestly surprised how far down I had to scroll to see votes for #2!
38651,Definitely my favorite both in material and silhouette.
38652,Congrats OP!
38653,!
38654,Agreed!
38655,It also looks the most comfortable and that's usually a big priority for me when dress shopping.
38656,❤️ congratulations!
38657,!
38658,"I love the lace in the third one like so many others, but it was number 2 that I like the best."
38659,"You are beautiful, and it is a gorgeous dress."
38660,"Unfortunately, we don't see your face in the pictures wearing that one to see what your reaction might be to it."
38661,Go with the one that makes your soul sing though.
38662,"op, if you think the second one makes you feel the best, that's the dress for you!"
38663,"Ok then I'm giving you new advice: if you're doing a small ceremony and no reception, wear whichever one makes you feel like you'll never get the chance to wear a dress like that again."
38664,"But, I do think the 2nd dress looks banging just a percentage more over the others but my 2nd pic (if function isn't a concern) is the 1st one."
38665,But you wear all 3 beautifully.
38666,Your fiance is lucky.
38667,"If you want to hug any tall people, the sleeves on #1 will make that a challenge."
38668,"Whether it’s your groom or a good friend, just beware!"
38669,"Signed, a 5’3” former bride with a 6’2” spouse"
38670,The first one is my favorite as well.
38671,It’s timeless and classy.
38672,You’re going to be a gorgeous bride.
38673,Congratulations!
38674,"The first one looked AHHHMAZING, and it’s not my style at all."
38675,There’s not many people in the world that could pull it off either — gotta have shoulders like yours.
38676,Truly stunning!
38677,!
38678,"You look beautiful in all of them, but the 1st is least flattering to your figure."
38679,#2 and #3 are amazing though.
38680,Best wishes xoxo!
38681,!
38682,Of course!
38683,❤️❤️❤️
38684,"The second dress has a 1930s vibe, very chic, with beautiful flow and draping of the fabric!"

38687,"You’re welcome, which ever one you choose just know you’ll look stunning in."
38688,"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, im so glad you found things that make you feel so good about yourself!"
38689,"You look great, really."
38690,I think that’s your answer!
38691,The advice that helped me most when picking a dress was: Which would you pick if your wedding was tomorrow?
38692,Somehow it helped me chose the dress that made me feel the best in my own skin if that makes sense.
38693,There you go!
38694,It’s gorgeous and so are you!!
38695,!
38696,WHAT THE HELL LMFAO

38700,Fall is perfect and that’s the season I had in mind for that dress!
38701,Congratulations!
38702,You’re going to be a lovely bride.
38703,Oh you so remind me of her in that dress.
38704,"She was absolutely gorgeous, and you are no less beautiful!"
38705,"However, while you remind me of her in those pics, you truly do take every one of those dresses and put your own stamp on it."
38706,Future brides will be copying you!!
38707,💕Mom
38708,I would marry the shit out of you in that first dress ✌️
38709,You're welcome.
38710,I hope you have an amazing wedding day!
38711,This makes my heart glow to hear ❤️
38712,"I also like #3 best, but what you said here is the key thing.The expression on OPs face says it all."
38713,This is the dress.
38714,"I liked the first the best as well, but maybe I like the style more."
38715,The diagonal stitching in the front of number 2 gave me ocd.
38716,"I’m not a huge fan of 3, but that seems to be on trend."
38717,1 seemed the most “timeless” to me.
38718,This is so cute.
38719,I love it too!!
38720,🥰🤍
38721,I'm going to piggyback on this comment to let OP consider some kind of reception in the future.
38722,"If the couple decides to throw themselves a party, the second dress looks like it would be the easiest to dance in and would fit into the widest variety of venues."
38723,Oh wow what a beautiful gown!
38724,I would love to love anything like that!
38725,Thank you!

38747,"You'll have hard times, but remember to say yes more than you say no, to think of three things you appreciate about your spouse every time you think about something that frustrates you, to never stop thinking of little ways to make each other happy, and to care more about being kind than about being right."

As for your family not supporting your upcoming nuptials, the Irish have put it best - May those who love you love you; and those who don’t love you, may God turn their hearts."

38840,"People often say ""blood is thicker than water"" to say that family is more important than any relationships you choose, but this is a misquote."
38841,"The actual line is ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb,"" meaning the people you choose to be a part of your life are more important than those forced upon you."
38842,Make a family with the people you want in your life.
38843,If your birth family doesn't like it they can fuck off.
38844,"I’m your mom so I’m taking liberties with this AND it is entirely selfish to say but, if you so choose, oh my looooordy those are gonna be some cute babies!!"

38851,"A little wedding day advice from Grammy Rita: ""Eat."
38852,The.
38853,Food.
38854,"You paid for the food, make sure you make time to eat it!"
38855,"It'll settle your nerves to have something solid in your stomach."""
38856,"Now some from your brother here:

A crochet hook can help if you have an outfit with small buttons."
38857,Do a bathroom trial run.
38858,Know how to extract yourself from your outfit before it's an emergency.
38859,Throw a small sewing kit in the bathroom at your venue.
38860,It'll save someone the embarrassment of a broken outfit.
38861,Pack comfy socks and shoes for the next day.
38862,Your feet are probably gonna hurt from being on them all day.
38863,Have someone in your party with a granola bar or some nuts for you.
38864,If you're feeling headachy or crabby stop and have a bite.
38865,Same with water.
38866,"Don't feel ""obligated"" to invite anybody."
38867,It's your day.
38868,Do what makes you happy.
38869,I could go on and on but you get the jist.
38870,Take care.
38871,u/Suspicious-Ganache93 Congratulations!
38872,My advice is that rarely will the relationship ever be 50/50.
38873,"Somedays it's 75/25, 60/40, even 100/0."
38874,"Take it one day at a time, and on the days you can't make it through the day, take it an hour at a time, or even 60 seconds at a time."
38875,Remember it's always you and your spouse vs. a problem!
38876,"Sometimes the solutions to issues won't come immediately, and you can't reach a neat and tidy compromise, but pick the choice that causes the least amount of damage to the partnership."
38877,"And lastly, make sure to keep working on your friendship as a married couple."
38878,Keep your quirks and what makes you unique and make sure to celebrate those things about yourselves.
38879,Couples that can laugh together will last together.
38880,Good luck you two!
38881,❤️

38907,Aw you look like a lovely happy couple!
38908,Congratulations!
38909,My only word of advice is keep communicating.
38910,My one rule with my hubby is if something is bugging the other we talk about it straight away before it blows up to a huge argument.
38911,We have been together for 12 years and married for 3 so it works so far!
38912,You can do this!

38936,Lovely couple!
38937,"You two have to remember that you picked them, and don’t ever forget why."
38938,"If possible have mental check ins once a week (or however often you need them), where you both let each other in on what’s in your hearts and on your minds."
38939,It keeps communication open and helps us keep from resenting each other.
38940,"Best of luck, best of love, and May your marriage be healthy and happy."
38941,"Mum here,  sweetheart you found your special person, that makes me so so happy, to see you happy is the next feeling I can have, your family is missing out on all this joy, love that is all that matters, love each other, enjoy your time together, be happy and know that this mum here is proud of you x"

39008,My advice from 17 years is to be slow in your responses when you're angry.

39018,You just did!
39019,I’m so proud of the two of you.

39068,"❤❤

If I may offer some advice, I highly recommend premarital counselling."
39069,"A lot of people think ""we don't have problems, why get premarital counselling?"""

39222,!
39223,♥️
39224,You two are so adorable!!
39225,Religion should never keep you from being happy and I’m almost 100% sure any God or being you’d worship would want you happy too.
39226,Marriage is not easy.
39227,It’s key to communicate about everything even when it seems silly.
39228,Staying on the same page and having mutual respect will go far.
39229,You can have disagreements but you have to make sure you never go to bed angry.
39230,Work it out and don’t give up.

I want to say congratulations on your engagement and I wish you the best."
39239,The two of you look like an amazingly happy couple.
39240,I'm so happy you found each other.
39241,"Communication in a relationship is key, so always remember to talk to each other, even when it isn't easy."
39242,"Family is important but family isn't just the group you were born into, sometimes the closest family is the one that you choose."
39243,I hope that the two of you have many many years of happiness together.
39244,All the love and support.
39245,Congratulations sweethearts!

39249,"Mom advice:

You wedding is your wedding."
39250,Don't let anyone force you to do anything or invite people that don't add to the joy of the day.
39251,"That being said, the wedding day is just one day."
39252,Expect some disasters and roll with it.
39253,50/50 doesn't work nearly as well as 100/100.
39254,Both partners should give more than 50%.
39255,You will have days that even though you love each other you won't like each other very much.
39256,This will pass.
39257,"Having some separate hobbies, interests, friends, alone time is healthy!"
39258,Can't wait to see the wedding pics!

39265,Congratulations on y’all’s engagement and upcoming marriage!
39266,Congrats!
39267,It warms my heart to see you happy!
39268,"If I was your mom, I would be gleefully spreading the word on facebook to the rest of the fam and friends."
39269,How exciting!
39270,Isn't it great to learn about a different culture from a dearly loved one?
39271,You look so happy.
39272,It makes me feel all warm and gooey inside.
39273,"My dear children, remember apologized easily and often."
39274,Things we do and say in moments of frustration and confusion can hurt our partners.
39275,Sometimes the way we see situations can differ greatly from them.
39276,"If we see that we've hurt them, it can be easy to get rooted in the feeling that, ""I didn't do anything wrong."""
39277,Defensiveness isn't helpful.
39278,"You may feel that, and that is human and okay."
39279,But think a bit about the fact that the one you love was hurt or angered.
39280,"You are not responsible for their feelings, but you should care about their pain."
39281,"And you both should want to explore how you communicate, and what is behind the taking of offense/feeling of defensiveness."
39282,Your different experiences have gotten you to this moment.
39283,Learning about how that history has shaped your hidden wounds together will help you grow together.
39284,Congratulations and best wishes.
39285,Hey guys!
39286,Only 33 but still a mom.
39287,"You guys look so happy together, I wish you all the love and happiness in the world."
39288,Religion is such a shitty reason to be mean to people.
39289,So sorry for your family situation.
39290,❤️
39291,Congrats!!
39292,!
39293,((Hugs)) I’m so happy for you!
39294,"Remember to always put each other first,  to communicate, and that love is a verb."
39295,You look so happy.
39296,Don’t let outsiders stress you out.
39297,Just love and support one another and the rest will have to accept you as a couple.
39298,I'm very happy for you.
39299,Sometimes you have to ignore people who are against you.
39300,Congratulations!!
39301,I am proud of you for forging your own path and being your own support system.
39302,"Hard, but worth it."
39303,Enjoy your young relationship!
39304,!
39305,The two of you are such a cute couple!!
39306,Congratulations!!!!
39307,!
39308,"> It helps to be a little deaf

This made me laugh."
39309,I'll remember that one.
39310,"Thank you, mom ❤️."
39311,I love this ❤️
39312,"Thank you, mom ❤️."
39313,This motivates me to stay strong.
39314,"Thank you, so much."
39315,It's easy to focus on the negative and forgot about the joy that the two of us have shared over all these years.
39316,Thanks for reminding me.
39317,"Thanks for the encouragement, mom."
39318,I find it hard to enforce the boundaries or sometimes simply don't realise that they have been crossed until it's too late.
39319,But I try and get better at it every day.
39320,"Wow - some good advice right there (that I didn't know I needed, and I've been married 22 years!)."
39321,Thanks!
39322,"OP, this is golden."
39323,"OP also: you are *loved*, and you have a fine man to love in return."
39324,"You guys have what you need to build a future, with or without other family - you guys are your own family now."
39325,"And when you need more, we're here, and yaknow your Internet moms are **always** in your corner."
39326,"You've got this, and we've got you."
39327,"Best,
Mom-from-a-distance XX"
39328,Yep same here
39329,I had a good laugh at that Irish saying.
39330,I think I'll remember it for the future.
39331,"Thanks for the encouragement, sib ❤️"
39332,Thank you so much.
39333,This does encourage me a lot.
39334,I feel exactly the same too.
39335,We aren't harming anyone; if they choose to be offended then it's on them.
39336,"Thank you, sib."
39337,We both feel the same.
39338,I must also say that the two of us are very open to each other and we well understand eachother's difference in belief.
39339,"We are honestly happy with each other, thank you for seeing that too."
39340,Thank you so much.
39341,"I'm actually the gentleman in the picture, I only realised now that my post is ambiguous."
39342,"But, I really appreciate the offer of help, because my family is of course not supporting us in the planning."
39343,It's a bit much to do it alone.
39344,Thank you.
39345,"That's all I really want, to grow happy and old together, and I think I have just the right partner for that!"
39346,Thank you so much.
39347,Your kind words warm my heart ❤️.
39348,"Yeah, the two of us have also been through a lot over the past 5 years."
39349,And each time we manage to get through it stronger.
39350,"Thank you, sib, for the advice."
39351,You're pointing out some important things that I didn't consider.
39352,I'll save this for later.
39353,Thanks again 🙂
39354,Thank you so much!
39355,That's very encouraging.
39356,"Thank you, mom."
39357,This is something I myself also had to learn the hard way.
39358,I wished I had this mentality from the start.
39359,"But, I suppose we live and we learn."
39360,Thanks again for your encouraging words ❤️
39361,"Yes, I can confidently say that we love and respect each other."
39362,Thank you for re-affirming that for me.
39363,I am also looking forward to the day that I can share our wedding photos with all of you.
39364,"Thank you, I certainly will do that 🤗"
39365,Hi mom.
39366,Thank you for your heartfelt advice.
39367,I fully agree and we actually already have an appointment planned for counseling.
39368,I'm sure it will only strengthen our bond!
39369,"My dad's advice, based on 40 years of being married to my mother was threefold: communication, negotiation, and a sense of humor."
39370,"Now, he passed away eleven years ago, but I think her current husband (of eight and a half years) would agree with RBG."
39371,"I think that Ruth Bader Ginsberg said that!oops, I see she was already quoted."
39372,I bet she was a great mom.
39373,"Baby, your life belongs to YOU, and you get to choose how (and with whom) you spend it."
39374,"If it's any comfort to you, my husband and I came from different faiths, and we just celebrated our 24th anniversary last month."
39375,"He's my best friend in the whole world, and every day is better because he's in it."
39376,"I'm thrilled for you - go grab your joy (and we'd better get some pictures from the wedding, please!)"
39377,❤️
39378,There’s just so many good videos on YouTube.
39379,For setting boundaries or pretty much whatever it is you need to do to keep toxic people out of your life.
39380,Here’s some advice that my French Canadian friends taught me many years ago.
39381,They had a beautiful happy marriage and we’re obviously still so in love 15 years later.
39382,"Since they speak both French and English, but primarily English, she told me once that they use the more formal word for you (vous) rather than the less formal (tu)."
39383,Why?
39384,She told me that it’s because her grandmother had told her that one should always speak to one’s spouses as though that spouse is a just little bit better than oneself.
39385,I love that.
39386,"So you can sort of “fight” over which of you is better, and maybe it’ll work for you like it did for my old friends."
39387,That's the best you can ask for - understanding and respect for each other's beliefs.
39388,I hope y'all have a wonderful wedding :D
39389,Whoops!
39390,My bad for making the assumption.
39391,"My family isn't interested in my wedding either, and I just thought it'd be nice to chat about it."
39392,Sometimes chatting helps me get things sorted in my head.
39393,I'm here is you want a big sister's opinion.
39394,Then hotdamn babes!
39395,You're already miles ahead most married couples.
39396,"You have excellent wisdom kiddo, you guys are gonna take everything life throws at you!"
39397,Can't wait to see the wedding pics!
39398,!
39399,I LOVE those pants.
39400,They create such a graceful silhouette.
39401,And you look lovely.
39402,Happiness is the best makeup ever.

39405,I love this look on you.
39406,Very classy.
39407,Your hair is so lovely.
39408,Have you though about adding some nail polish?
39409,A subtle shade to match your bracelets will be a great finishing touch.
39410,And maybe some earrings.
39411,I'm very proud of you for being your authentic self.
39412,Keep going.
39413,Your smile is so beautiful and confidence looks good on you!
39414,I'm proud of you for being confident in yourself!
39415,Tell me about your choice of socks (tights?)
39416,with the flats.
39417,I always love hearing about people's sense of fashion and where they get their inspiration from.
39418,The last pic is my favorite hon.
39419,I would have that printed on my coffee mug to think about you every day!
39420,Have a great time.
39421,"I'm proud of you, sweetheart <3"
39422,You look amazing!!

39457,You look so pretty and happy!
39458,My first thought was “Moms” is an interesting component.
39459,"Then I swiped, saw ur expression… this makes sense."
39460,I learned something today.
39461,Thanks for that
39462,I love this!
39463,Especially the pants.
39464,The only thing I would change is the socks.
39465,Go black or do something funky!
39466,"I love a wild sock, even just black with polka dots or flowers."
39467,How do you have so much style right off the bat?
39468,I've been female for all my 34 years and I don't have half that much natural style.
39469,Excuse me girlie...
39470,But you cant just post those amazing pants and not say where you got them!

39494,Just keep being you!
39495,"I know it's the first trek outside, and you're gathering some more wardrobe material, but have you thought of what your style could be?"
39496,"Maybe colorful and flowery, or more neutral?"
39497,It's a good idea to venture out of your bubble a little further than your first step.
39498,"As many have said, the first step is the hardest, and you're clearly rocking the first look!"
39499,Cute outfit!

40094,You’re soooo beautiful omg 😍😍😍 love the pants!!!
40095,"I’m super tall too and I think that having wide flowy pants with a high waist can look so good, it helps to even out proportions while also making long legs into a feature… if you’ve got it, flaunt it!"
40096,And nice and elegant but not too dressy.
40097,Love your style and your CURLS GURL !!!!

40108,I absolutely love your outfit I hope you felt beautiful
40109,"If you ever want to talk about shoes, let me know."
40110,I've had so much trouble finding shoes in my size that I've kind of become obsessed with them.
40111,Have you tried without socks/stockings?
40112,One other thought- have you tried the outfit without tying the top?
40113,I feel like it cuts your torso in the middle.
40114,I really like the outfit and your hair.
40115,Good jewelry accessorizing.
40116,I'm sure you rocked it in those flowy pants.

40203,!
40204,I tried to find some clip ons but the few I found just didn't fit the outfit.
40205,I wanted to go all out but I didn't want to buy something I wouldn't use again.
40206,The white socks were definitely a product of my self-confidence next time I'll think about not having them on.

40208,"And just looked through all the pics, you are GORGEOUS!!!"
40209,Pierce your ears and be fierce girl!!
40210,😍
40211,Oh please!
40212,I've been having trouble finding good stylish shoes in my size.
40213,Without socks is something im thinking of doing.
40214,I tied it cause I have belly fat and it helps push it back but I could try without it.
40215,It's all uphill from here right?
40216,plus the more I get the more versatile my wardrobe will be!
40217,Oh no stop it!
40218,I bet your looked amazing!
40219,We are our own harshest critics.
40220,I'm gonna experiment for sure!
40221,For sure!
40222,it is a solid purchase i gotta figure out what else to pair with it!
40223,oh i will 100% do that thanks for the advice!

40237,My mom was very tomboyish as well so i had to help her woth fashion when I was growing up.
40238,For sure!
40239,I have a 38” inseam.
40240,I feel ya!
40241,I remember buying some Mens levis in high school because I could get them by length and they actually dragged the ground with shoes on.
40242,I was in heaven!
40243,"You’re rocking those pants, lovely lady!"
40244,I'm gonna get them pierced very soon!
40245,I sent you a chat message.
40246,"I'm about to go to sleep for tonight, but I'd be happy to continue the conversation tomorrow."
40247,I have belly fat in the same area that you do.
40248,"When I tie clothes in that area, it creates a little side bulge."
40249,Try both ways and see what works best for you.
40250,"For me, fashion is about enjoying experimenting and being comfortable with myself."
40251,exactly.
40252,"build your wardrobe by selecting some classic pieces and then some splashy pieces to mix and match with, and you'll have outfits for days."
40253,":)

also, you don't have to spend a lot of money to build your wardrobe, be sure to check out the thrift stores in your area."
40254,We are.
40255,But mine was just a simple blue tee I borrowed from a friend.
40256,You got all sorts of prettied up.
40257,And honestly it looks like it did wonders for you.
40258,You were positively glowing.
40259,"It's great to see, one transfemme to another."
40260,Yes babe absolutely!
40261,!
40262,"😅👍🥰

That's so sweet!"
40263,I never really wanted help for myself...just for my poor under-served daughter 🤣
40264,Yeah for sure!
40265,There's a cardigan I have that is loose around the sides the also helps with reducing how the belly fat looks experimentation is key!
40266,Thank you so much!
40267,All uphill from here right?
40268,You can always look online for tutorials and stuff!
40269,Theres nothing that cant be learned.
40270,I hope you enjoy trying out different looks.
40271,"When my husband isn’t around, I will just try on a bunch of my clothes and style it."
40272,I am not sure why I only do it when I am alone but I really enjoy that me time.
40273,Absolutely.
40274,And you're killing it early.
40275,I wish you the best.
40276,"Nah, I'm just happy living my best dress-and-nail-polish-and-makeup-avoiding tomboy life 👍😅 

I'm glad my daughter and my mom had each other to share fashionista stuff with though...bc they were both disappointed with my lack of interest in the whole thing...lol

I appreciate beauty, and respect other people's interest in makeup, clothes etc...it just really hasn't been my jam since like high school, and I'm cool with that ;) 
That was the only brief stage in my life when I had any interest in fashion/makeup at all (it was probably peer pressure...lol) So my mom was disappointed when I was little bc I hated being dressed up like a doll...and my daughter was disappointed later on bc I was useless with fashion insight or makeup skills, though I happily bought her all of the girly clothes and accessories, nail polish, makeup etc that she wanted when she expressed her interest 💜

That's a great attitude overall though...that it's never too late to learn and grow to achieve your goals and dreams!"
40277,🌸💖🌸
40278,If there's anything I've learned is that being yourself is the best thing you can be!
40279,Absolutely!!!
40280,❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
40281,I'm so sorry you were SAed.
40282,"But that painting is awesome, it belongs in an art gallery or a school book."
40283,Devastating piece.
40284,"And as both a mom and an artist, you absolutely are an artist."
40285,There aren't any magical credentials required to validate your art.
40286,"If you create art, you are an artist, even if you never share what you create with another living Soul."
40287,"But I am glad you shared this with us, and I'm glad you made it."
40288,Painting really helped me work through my own trauma.
40289,Sending you love.
40290,damn that makes me feel
40291,"Very moving piece, I wish you the best in your healing  journey!"
40292,"The world can be a truly evil place, but you CAN and WILL rise above!"
40293,"Beautiful work, very touching, keep it up!"
40294,I don’t know if you ever watched Doctor Who.
40295,But my absolute favorite episode is called Vincent and the Doctor.
40296,They go back in time and meet Vincent Van Gogh.
40297,"Later, they talk to the curator of a museum."
40298,"They ask him where Van Gogh rates in the history of art, and his quote has always spoken so strongly to my heart."
40299,"“Well... um... big question, but, to me Van Gogh is the finest painter of them all."
40300,"Certainly the most popular, great painter of all time."
40301,"The most beloved, his command of colour most magnificent."
40302,He transformed the pain of his tormented life into ecstatic beauty.
40303,"Pain is easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world, no one had ever done it before."
40304,Perhaps no one ever will again.
40305,"To my mind, that strange, wild man who roamed the fields of Provence was not only the world's greatest artist, but also one of the greatest men who ever lived”
Honey you have taken something so heart breaking and tragic, and turned it into unspeakably beautiful art."
40306,I’m so proud of you.
40307,You didn't deserve what happened to you.
40308,But you deserve to be proud of what you're doing with your experience.
40309,This is really interesting *and good.
40310,*
40311,I was brutally raped and left naked in an empty strangers house 15 years ago.
40312,This piece has really evoked some feelings.
40313,I thank you for sharing it.
40314,It really captures a certain feeling that I don't really know how to describe.
40315,"I look at it and I'm scared at how vulnerable she is, hanging there, like I was back then."
40316,I appreciate you sharing this.
40317,"I wish you peace, it takes time but it is possible X"
40318,"The painting is gorgeous, I hope you find peace within yourself one day, I love it."
40319,I'm proud of you!
40320,"Wow, that’s an amazing piece of art."
40321,I’ve never seen SA portrayed with that concept before.

40323,I’m sorry you experienced those things.
40324,I hope the art is helping.
40325,Come back and show us more.
40326,💜
40327,That’s a very powerful piece.
40328,Dealing with trauma through creation is good therapy.

40331,this is touching beyond words and very well done.
40332,"the lines, the shadows, the proportions - hands are so hard to get right."
40333,I like that the hand looks like literal shit.
40334,the absence of a mouth on that person makes me very sad.
40335,I hope you find peace and some sort of healing.
40336,"I'm no art critic but that piece is beautiful, I love it!"
40337,I love that you were able to turn your trauma into something beautiful.
40338,Having a creative outlet will be great self therapy for you.

40354,"I'm glad you were able to show it to me this way, I know it took courage."
40355,That's so powerful - it's heartbreaking.
40356,You have the artist's gift of conveying emotion in a static image.
40357,I'm sorry you went through SA.
40358,None of us deserve that.
40359,That is very very evocative.
40360,Well done.
40361,As someone else whose dealt with SA (loooong ago) it really spoke to me.
40362,"This painting is one of the most beautiful and impactful paintings I have ever seen, you are a gift to the world for the beauty you put out into it.❤ I am sorry that, for this masterpiece, you had to go through something traumatic, but I am glad you came out stronger and opening the eyes of more people to this very real issue."

40387,And that there is a story to tell.
40388,I hope you show this to people who are close to you.
40389,It is amazing.
40390,It has feeling.
40391,"This is really great work and I’m really proud of you - from someone who’s also had this experience, and also is sort of technically an artist, but you’re far more of an artist than I am."
40392,"This is really powerful and striking, and you should be very proud of using your talent too capture something that’s so hard to put into words."
40393,"Wow, the emotion in this."
40394,I’m so sorry you went through that.
40395,"I hope you keep painting, you have a serious talent here, and I’m not just saying that!"
40396,This should be in a museum.
40397,It is poignant and raw and eloquent.
40398,"Wow, I’m so proud of you."
40399,You can take a blank canvas and paint something that can make me cry.
40400,I’m so talentless at art and it’s so wonderful to see my daughter has ended up with such exquisite talent.
40401,Please continue to heal yourself.
40402,"I had to look up ""SA""."
40403,I think your painting is excellent.

40410,"I'm typically not someone who feels anything from art pieces, it's just not something my brain does."
40411,Art museums are completely lost on me.
40412,This however has me feeling so many emotions all at once.
40413,It's just powerful.
40414,It's amazing.

40416,I hope you can heal and find peace.

40421,I am so proud of you for overcoming and finding a safe outlet.
40422,You mean a lot to/in this world 🫶🏽
40423,"Hey friend, I just wanted to say that although I might not be mum, I can sympathize with you."
40424,"It’s tough going through an encounter of any kind but I just wanted to say that this painting is beautiful and you shouldn’t be ashamed at all for what you went through, it’s not your fault and you are strong and majestic af."
40425,"If you ever need to talk, you’re more than welcome to send me a message!"
40426,I’m really sorry for what you went through sweetie but the way you expressed yourself here is really amazing and tragically moving.
40427,It’s a very unique look at what you  experienced.
40428,"It’s sad but beautiful and I truly hope you’ve healed, even if it’s just a little and that doing this piece may have helped some."
40429,It's certainly a compelling piece.
40430,I hope it was at the very least somewhat cathartic.
40431,Hope you're doing alright and taking each day one at a time.
40432,"Sending you a hug, if you want it."
40433,Xx

40441,This is great and I'm not even sure what SA means.
40442,Can anyone explain?
40443,Ooof.
40444,This image punched me right in the gut.
40445,this deserves to be in a museum
40446,"First, thank you for trusting me with this."
40447,"What happened to you was horrible, and I'm impressed with the beauty you've created from it."
40448,I actually caught my breath in my throat.
40449,You summed up a many feelings I had after that I couldn’t articulate and still can’t in many ways.
40450,Please keep painting and processing however you feel best.
40451,thank you
40452,This is breathtaking.
40453,I really hope pouring your feelings on the canvas will help you in your healing journey.

40472,"Every month they choose an artistic contribution that focuses on women’s issues and print it on a sticker for their patrons, I’ve received some beautiful artwork on stickers from them."
40473,"This is the type of artwork they prioritize, if you feel so inclined you may want to submit your work."
40474,"Sending you all the good energy and joy to fill your heart, you deserve it and more ❤️"
40475,The hand is a great shape.

40564,"I'm sorry for everything you've been through sweetie, but look what you created from that pain, proof you're stronger and should be proud of yourself."
40565,You should talk to a gallery or other place locally for maybe a small collection?
40566,Something to consider as a therapy or way of release!
40567,Maybe Collab with other artists?
40568,"Thank you, that means so much to me 🙏 I am no artist by any means, just couldn't sleep and was compelled to paint."
40569,This is a huge step forward in my healing!
40570,Wow.
40571,Thank you.
40572,You're totally right ❤️
40573,Thank you so much 🥹

40577,Thank you so much ❤️
40578,"That means so much to me, thank you."
40579,"Wow, I'm so sorry you had to go through that."
40580,"That's absolutely horrible, nobody deserves to feel like she feels."
40581,"I hope you have found peace, too."
40582,"❤️

I was 13."
40583,And it was 13 years ago now.
40584,I was groomed and raped by a man for about 6 months.
40585,"Part of me thought it would never stop, I kept silent for 9 years."
40586,"Now I've been in therapy for many years, the healing never ends, but making this piece has changed me."
40587,I'm glad I could evoke some emotions for you.
40588,"All I want is to help people, however I can."
40589,🙏 Xoxo
40590,Thank you so much.
40591,Bahaha the hand looking like shit was not on purpose but I definitely connect to that meaning!
40592,Love it.
40593,The mouth missing was for 9 years of silence.
40594,I was only a child.
40595,"The pink aura is my childlike spirit, dwindling away."
40596,"There's so much in this piece that has meaning to me, I'm so glad everyone is able to see the meanings too."
40597,"It's been 13 years now, tons of therapy, and I've never been better."
40598,Thank you for your well wishes ❤️
40599,Thank you so much.
40600,"It has been 13 years since the assault, I was only a child."
40601,"I have been in therapy for many many years now, working on finding the right medication too."
40602,I'm doing MUCH better than I ever have before.
40603,Finally healing.
40604,"Much love to you as well, thank you for everything you do xoxo"
40605,Thank you so much.
40606,"I'm glad you can see the feelings, I just wanted others to be able to connect to it too!"
40607,I'm so sorry you had to deal with this too.
40608,No one should have this burden.
40609,I mostly wanted to share it here because my sister told me many people would be able to relate to it.
40610,"I think that's very true, and if I can help or inspire other people's healing, that would help my healing too."
40611,Gotta spread that love.
40612,"Wow, thank you so much 😭 I just don't want anyone else to feel this way."
40613,"Hearing all the other stories just breaks my heart, but we will rise up, and create things unimaginable."
40614,I wouldn't be who I am today if it wasn't for my past.
40615,❤️
40616,So glad you could connect with it.
40617,"Sharing the healing vibes with you, sib 🙏"
40618,That's a great idea!
40619,I do love working with clay.
40620,"Thank you so much, I'm so sorry you had to go through what you did."
40621,We don't deserve it.
40622,❤️
40623,I actually wanted it to look provocative in a sexual way at first glance.
40624,Then you realize a young girl is being assaulted.
40625,Her pink aura (childlike spirit) dwindling away as she sleeps bound to her adult captor.
40626,"I think I'll call it ""groomed""."
40627,"So thank you, that's exactly how I wanted it to come out ❤️"
40628,I love you too!!
40629,You guys are all the best.
40630,I'm so overwhelmed with support 😭❤️
40631,Thank you so much!
40632,You ARE an artist!

40646,Thank you so much friend 🥹
40647,"Thank you so much 🙏 it has been 13 years, the healing never stops, but making this piece has moved me leaps and bounds forward ❤️"
40648,Very cathartic!!
40649,"I couldn't even handle all the emotions coming up, very empowering."
40650,"It's been 13 years since the assault, and I've been in therapy a long time, but this was something that no amount of therapy could help with."
40651,"I always want hugs, so thank you so much ❤️"
40652,Thank you Momma Bear 🥹 I'm starting to believe it.
40653,Thank you so much!!
40654,I'm glad you can feel the emotion.
40655,"I think painting this has been the biggest step forward in my healing journey so far, so much emotion finally released ❤️"
40656,Sexual assault
40657,Good 😈💜

40676,"😵‍💫 Hearing these comments about how I could put this in a gallery is wild, I never would have thought I could create something that grandeur."
40677,"So much inspiration from you all, thank you 🙏"
40678,"I'm not sugarcoating or anything, that painting looks like the work of a pro."
40679,"And let it all out however you like, from personal experience Ibcan say it helps"
40680,You ARE an artist
40681,"You can say you're not an artist all you want, but you created something beautiful from a painful life experience."
40682,"If you look at any artist, you'll find the same."
40683,"You are just as valid as they are, even if you don't have a huge backlog of work."

40691,You have a natural talent and it would be a shame not to use it.
40692,"I also know that it was intimidating to share your work for the first time, but look at all that you have accomplished."
40693,I’m so proud of you!
40694,Please share your future work.
40695,Moms love to watch people grow and develop.
40696,I think what you just described is I’m fact what makes you an artist.
40697,"You may never paint again, but your explanation makes me think this isn’t the last time we’ll hear from you"
40698,What are you talking about?
40699,Of course you’re an artist.
40700,Your painting is incredible .
40701,I got the meaning immediately.
40702,Not many people are to express what their thinking artistically.
40703,Two thumbs up!
40704,You’re wrong.
40705,You are definitely an artist.
40706,If you make art then you’re an artist!
40707,You don’t have to be Picasso for it to count.
40708,"My only tip for watching Doctor Who, is the first 3 or so episodes suck haha."
40709,"But if you can get through those, I promise it gets better"
40710,You're welcome.
40711,"Your mom would be proud, too."

40716,I'm doing better now.
40717,"I was 16 at the time, I'll be 31 soon."
40718,I have an amazingly compassionate husband who has helped me heal.
40719,I go to therapy weekly and really push myself out of my comfort zone.
40720,"I express myself through art, too."
40721,I sew and paint / sketch.
40722,My latest [piece](https://imgur.com/a/P9MHhj9) is about how great it felt to get my hair washed at the salon.
40723,It's the first time I'd enjoyed anything like that (relaxing and giving control to a stranger without freaking out inside) in years.
40724,I came home and created it a week or so ago.
40725,Hearing others stories of survival brings me hope.
40726,May we both keep healing 🌻❤️
40727,yes I noticed the pink cloud and it seemed hopeful - in some guided meditation they say to imagine yourself in pink (and/or green) light for healing.
40728,Sending them right back ❤️❤️
40729,You absolutely should!!
40730,Your work would be great for galleries and I bet it would resonate with a lot of people!

40739,Thank you!
40740,"All there is to do is reach out to local venues, and other creators."
40741,The worst they can do is say no!
40742,"It's absolutely worth the effort, even just creating for more personal reasons."
40743,Good luck and healing ❤️

41093,"We are amazingly tough, aren't we?"
41094,You mentioned a NDE the comments.
41095,Can you share what you saw?
41096,"If you don't want to, or it's traumatic or upsets you, absolutely do **not** feel obligated to reply."
41097,The reason that I'm inordinately curious - I know one other person who had a NDE in a car accident.
41098,Her main takeaway was that she was very calm and in zero pain from the 11 shoulder surgeries she'd endured up to that day.
41099,"As someone who is in chronic pain every single day of my life, that was...a welcome thing to hear, if that makes sense."
41100,"Again, no requirement to answer!"
41101,The world is a better place with you in it.
41102,We need you here.
41103,You enrich the lives of everyone who know you.
41104,That’s why you are still here.

41144,So glad you are still here.
41145,"Beloved child,

Of course it has affected you!!"
41146,That is only natural and I hope that you have someone you trust that you can talk about that with.
41147,Your old honourary Mum here has died a few times myself when I was a teenager and then almost again last year.
41148,It DOES change you.

41198,I love that!
41199,I had a NDE and Im gonna start saying that.
41200,Thanks!
41201,Me and 2 best friends were out drinking.
41202,One was Designated driver.
41203,We were having a good night and I wake up in the hospital a month later.
41204,My friend Jake had a seizure at the wheel and the car (98 mustang) hit a tree doing 75.
41205,My door hit the tree and my body folded in half.
41206,"I got a plate in my dome,some pins in my back and 2 screws in my pelvis."
41207,The worse part about it is after I was resuscitated I ended up being diagnosed with some fukkin mental disorders.
41208,I fukked my brain up.
41209,I love them In that order too.😅😅
41210,Ups and downs.
41211,But mostly up
41212,I know my purpose now...
41213,Turns out I am a badass daddy.
41214,My wreck was 18 years ago today.
41215,My kids are torturing me as we speak.
41216,I don't remember anything.
41217,Nah.
41218,I was drugged up.
41219,I literally have no idea what I was doing with my hands.
41220,I'm pretty fukkin country.
41221,I ain't got time for that gangbangin shit.
41222,I was drugged up.
41223,IDK WTF I was doing with my hands.
41224,I'm country as fukk so gang signs ain't it.
41225,Be thankful to the medical staff before God
41226,Your user name made me giggle 😉.
41227,How are you after the accident--you mentioned ii fukked with you.
41228,"Yeah, absolutely do that!"
41229,My little son has a second birthday each year since his life-saving surgery and we always celebrate being able to be still together.
41230,I celebrate it like a real birthday!
41231,My second bday is 19Feb2010 and I celebrate by getting a brain mixer shot lol
41232,It sounds like you're doing well now.
41233,Congrats on doing the hard work to overcome all of that.
41234,I am so glad you’re still here.
41235,I’m sorry that you have a more difficult time now.
41236,It’s not fair when you did everything right.
41237,"Know you’re loved, and I hope you’re enjoying life the best you can."
41238,Wow.
41239,What happened that they declared you dead then changed their minds?
41240,"As a fellow TBI sufferer check out the community, there is one on Reddit and they are very welcoming."
41241,"It's a common thing to have issues with mental health, especially with certain brain injuries causing damage to parts of the brain dealing with emotion."
41242,I've found learning a new language is helping which is crazy.
41243,Not sure why but I'm finding it is helping with my emotions.
41244,I've heard others learnt an instrument or dived into learning to paint.
41245,Therapy though is great if you can talk to someone who specializes in brain injury patients.
41246,If not try an art therapist.
41247,It is really good apparently as it can help you work through things emotionally but also even if the verbal pathways are damaged.
41248,fuck yeah dude i love tech n9ne
41249,Thank God.
41250,That's all any of us can hope for.
41251,Glad you're still here.

41255,Glad you are still here!
41256,Aww so proud of you and your family!
41257,Here's to another 18+ *cheers*
41258,What an amazing thing to do!
41259,I love that ❣️
41260,My lungs collapsed apparently.
41261,IDK what happened I was out for weeks.
41262,When I woke up originally I was screaming in pain (and probably fear) thinking hell looks mightily like a hospital.
41263,I really don't have much memories of it except 1 friend died and the other saved my life with a broken back.
41264,He made it far enough with a broken back for someone to see him drop.
41265,Everything I know was told to me by Mrs. Pam ) who found us) My bubba (who broke his back) And the medics.
41266,Look at my page and you will see my son on stage with Tech numerous times.
41267,Even a video of his face lighting up and stopping a whole ass concert to say hi to my son

41319,"Such a beautiful couple 🤍 

I’m so happy for you."
41320,I have a few bits of advice- I’ve been married for almost 19 years (together 25+) to my best friend since I was 15.
41321,It’s ok to go to bed mad!
41322,"We always say I love you even if we’re angry, but sometimes it’s healthier to get a good night sleep, eat a healthy breakfast, get a cup of coffee, and *then* hash it out."
41323,It’s ok to take some time and space and come back when you know you can handle it.
41324,Marriage isn’t 50/50.
41325,It should be 100/100 with both giving your all the best that you can.
41326,Sometimes it will be 80/20 or 60/40- love and support the other and give extra when it’s needed.
41327,"As long as you both do this, you’ll not get burned out 🤍🤍

Don’t forget to continue to date and have fun!"
41328,I’m so so happy for you!
41329,Congratulations!
41330,Blessings for a long happy life together!❤️❤️
41331,Oh Honey!!

41524,He makes the sweetest face when I say Husband now
41525,He’s so handsome and I looove the beard
41526,I looove how the green looked.
41527,I had a black corset over top for the ceremony too.
41528,He makes me so happy
41529,Okay… this one got me crying.
41530,Thank you so much.
41531,Hug gratefully accepted and returned
41532,Thank you so much.
41533,All the advice is appreciated.
41534,"We definitely have to work on letting ourselves sleep if serious conversations happen into the night, but we both very much believe in the ever shifting divisions of support, and we’ve both been in both positions of giving and receiving."
41535,It’s something we’ve shown to each other time and time again and I wouldn’t have married him if he didn’t believe in it too.
41536,Congrats on your many years together and I’m excited for our many years 🥰
41537,Mostly matching!
41538,"We both got from the same place, he got a slightly wider frame."

41551,And thank you for the hug back 🤗
41552,I’ll owe some of that amazing wife-ness to him and his family.
41553,I didn’t have the best examples of love growing up but with him I’ve learned what I should truly expect and the ways we take care of each other.
41554,I’m so lucky.
41555,LEETT'''S FUCKING GOOOo!!!!!
41556,!
41557,"Congratulations, honey!!"

41563,You are smart to keep the exact amount you are earning to yourself.
41564,Congrats!
41565,Do you live independently?
41566,Make sure you have a protected savings account in just your name.
41567,"Not sure what country you're in, but if you need to offshore it to make sure it's protected from your family or future spouse, please do so."
41568,Your parents are doing your brother a disservice as much as you by not expecting much from him.
41569,This type of favoritism makes it very hard for the children child to function as an adult independent of parents.
41570,"In a weird way, they almost did you a favor."
41571,Remember you are an independent woman and can choose how much contact you want with your family.
41572,"As your internet mom, I'm very proud of you"
41573,I'm so glad you've been able to make yourself independent from your toxic narcissist family.
41574,I know the dynamic well.
41575,And you're right to not share your happy news with them.
41576,It's the safest course.
41577,I'm so proud of you for all your hard work!
41578,And for not giving in to the impulse to rub their faces in your success -- it never ends well.
41579,Congrats on your happy news!

41591,I love you and am so proud.
41592,Well done sister!

41598,❤️

41614,Well done!!
41615,!
41616,"{{{{ 🦋HUGS🦋 }}}} More of a soul sister in this situation, than mom."
41617,You sound like the family’s forgotten child.
41618,"Been there, done that."
41619,"When I finally stood up for myself, I was awarded family scapegoat status."
41620,Honey you sound amazing.
41621,Good job!
41622,Hard work paying off is great to see &.
41623,YOU DID IT — without them.

41628,So many people have lived what you are living.

41632,"You have done exceptionally well, and you take that money, and you save it, and as others have said, protect it from outsiders."
41633,"It is yours, and yours alone."
41634,You earned it.
41635,"Although I am lucky because my family is not like this, I also come from a culture where the males are treated like kings, and the girls are secondary."
41636,But let me tell you this; you are second best to NO ONE.
41637,"You are amazing, and wonderful, and you never need to feel anything different."
41638,"Congratulations, kiddo."
41639,You are the greatest.
41640,Thrilled for you!
41641,Hooray!

41696,You are loved!
41697,😘
41698,(Mama of 3 boys) I am so proud of you and your strength to better your life and mental health.
41699,And THEN to get such an impressive raise so early in your career?
41700,Wow!
41701,I'm doing a happy dance here in Alabama for you and your future!
41702,You are amazing and deserving of love and respect!
41703,I saw where you said you moving out would be a sign you're earning more money.
41704,I don't know much about real estate but may I suggest talking with your bank about the best accounts to save for a DOWN PAYMENT and what to expect from mortgage payments/insurance.
41705,"That way you can plan your escape (bc, let's be honest, you're escaping a toxic life) and do it safely and relatively financially easy."
41706,Please transfer all accounts to a bank where your parents do NOT have an account.
41707,I've read entirely too many stories about parents talking with the tellers and stealing ALL their child's money.
41708,"Ok, back to the celebration, look up Elaine from Seinfeld dancing to get a giggle while imagining a middle aged white woman doing it too, with a huge smile on her face!"

42699,Every relationship is different.
42700,Just because a couple isn’t married doesn’t mean they can’t also have a lifetime of happiness.
42701,"And that’s what I wish for you, kind stranger!"
42702,🥺💛

42713,"🫶🏻 

I’ve been married for 12 years and my husband and I have been to hell and back multiple times!"
42714,"(I have a genetic disorder and have been so close to dying, so many times, that Doctors told my husband to plan my funeral on more than one occasion!)"
42715,"From the time I started dating as a teen, my Mum drilled into me “If he doesn’t make you laugh out loud at least once a day, don’t stay with him!”

Even at our lowest moments, when it felt like the whole world was against us, we stood side by side and we found a way to laugh."
42716,Sometimes that even means laughing through tears!
42717,"Never stay with a man that doesn’t make you happy, you beautiful lady, he should be able to make you laugh, even during your darkest hours together."
42718,Laughter really is the best medicine!
42719,My husband has me in fits of giggles multiple times every day and I know we can face any bad situation with humour!
42720,Happiness is the whole point of marriage in today’s world.
42721,"If you’re not happy, it’s not worth it."
42722,"You will have those tears for sure, but if you can make each other laugh through them, you’ll be solid as a rock!"
42723,"These pictures though, they make my heart swell."
42724,"I know you can take on life together, you’re clearly made for each other."
42725,"All I wish for you is that your marriage is as happy, healthy and secure as mine!"
42726,I’m stupidly happy for you!!!!
42727,❤️❤️❤️
42728,Awe I'm so happy for you sweetie.
42729,It sounds amazing I hope you have the most perfect day for the wedding of your dreams.
42730,Maybe a wedding picture or two if you’d like!!
42731,!
42732,Well they came out great!
42733,Very lovely warm feeling.
42734,Kohls is dangerous to my wallet.
42735,You're welcome sweetie!
42736,💜

42741,Feel free to PM me.
42742,"I got married this past Halloween, and we had just under 100 guests."
42743,"It’s a lot, but it’ll be a wonderful day."
42744,"If you can afford it, get a wedding planner."
42745,"If not, then don’t stress too much about every detail being perfect."
42746,"I’m happy for ya, sis 💕💕"

42756,He constantly makes me laugh even in the worse situations.
42757,I know that even as we get old and gray that he will still have his gorgeous blue eyes and amazing sense of humor.
42758,What more could I ask for in a life partner?
42759,I’ve never been more happy than when I’m with him.
42760,Never.
42761,We wish the best for you and your husband!

42780,"If you stand shoulder to shoulder through it all, you’ll make it through anything life throws at the two of you!"
42781,"I’m so glad that you can make each other laugh like that though, it really is the secret to a bloody amazing relationship!"
42782,"Keep laughing, keep loving and *always* keep talking!"
42783,"Everything you face, if you face it together, you’ll be unbreakable."
42784,"You may argue, you may not always know what to do in every situation but if you can talk about anything that crops up then you can figure it out between you in a way that leaves you both happy!"
42785,I’m proud of you both and crying tears of joy!
42786,Loving each other the way you do is special.
42787,"My husband is still the most handsome man I’ve ever laid eyes on, even after many years together!"
42788,"It makes me so happy to hear your words, you clearly love each other deeply and I’m so happy for you both, I could burst!"

43265,your eyeliner is fantastic!
43266,You look lovely.
43267,"I was always terrified of messing up when doing my eye makeup, but a friend of mine told me that my eyes should be ""sisters, not twins"" it really helped take the anxiety out of eye makeup for me."
43268,"However, your eyeliner is twins all the way"
43269,You’re gorgeous.
43270,And much better at winged eyeliner than I am!
43271,Oh that wing liner.

43290,I’m glad you’re having fun and taking care of yourself
43291,It looks so good!
43292,My tip: the best time to experiment and practice with makeup is just before bed because you’re gonna wipe it all off anyway and no one is there to see you so there’s no pressure
43293,"Oh hey sis, it looks great gj!"
43294,"If I can drop one piece of potential advice, it would be maybe have the red cover more of the eyelid so it looks a bit more natural?"
43295,"Although you know me, I have like no experience, take it with a grain of salt🤷‍♀️"
43296,You look stunning!
43297,And those wings look so neat and precise 💕
43298,I think it looks awesome!
43299,"Everyone starts makeup somewhere, no one just picks it up with ease."
43300,"As long as you love it, that’s all that matters!"
43301,"Makeup is subjective, do with it as you please ❤️"
43302,It looks great sweetheart!

43316,Can’t wait to try that!
43317,Thank you 🥰
43318, Brow gel sounds good .
43319,My go to brow thing is a brow pencil.
43320,My eyebrow has some thinker spots and some thicker spots so i just pencil in where i want it to look fuller and that's it.
43321,I have thick eyebrows.
43322,I once used a pencil and filled in my whole eyebrow i was looking at my eyebrow up close and not from a distance and when I looked at my eyebrows from a normal distance they looked so thick like Groucho thickness.
43323,:( They looked like look big giant black caterpillars.
43324,:( But not i know that is not the way for me.
43325,I think if i used the brow gel it might look the same for me.
43326,I'm still learning at 33 and I use an old drag hack.
43327,Elmer's glue stick.
43328,One pass over each brow and follow it with some eyeshadow.
43329,Works magic.
43330,I typically tint my brows to match my hair but I have also done rainbow and glitter!
43331,Thank you!

43342,I’m glad you think so!
43343,"It is, it’s my boyfriend’s shirt 🥰"
43344,Thank you!
43345,My sister taught me 😊
43346,"Thank you, it’s hard to think so 🥹"
43347,"Love that better brow, they also make a 24 hour setting gel that comes in a container like mascara."
43348,Ulta usually sells the trial size of both of those products if you wanted to just try it out.
43349,Thats awesome!!!

43797,"its called ""i am sober"""
43798,I am sober
43799,Different coping mechanisms such as pulling tape off my skin where i wanted to self harm.
43800,Eventually I just stopped and im doing better
43801,I’m at the point where I don’t have that voice anymore and I hope you get there too.
43802,Thanks \^\^
43803,thanks!
43804,I’m glad you’re doing better!
43805,"be sure to try my idea, okay?"
43806,love you sis!
43807,Oh my.
43808,That’s beautiful 🤩.
43809,Seriously beautiful and classic and classy and age appropriate.
43810,I’m very impressed.
43811,She’s a lucky little girl and I bet she feels like a princess.
43812,Wonderful job.
43813,Old time sewer here.
43814,Now for the finishing touch.
43815,Steam press the bodice.
43816,Use paper lining between iron and fabric.
43817,Don’t use shots of steam.
43818,Practice first so you don’t get pooling water or water drops on fabric.
43819,"It will set the fabric, make the hemlines around the arms and neck uniform get rid of  the puckers in the neckline."
43820,A nice crisp finish.
43821,Steam pressing with paper is a secret weapon with sewing.
43822,I wouldn’t press the skirt.
43823,That’s more tricky.
43824,It’s a lovely project and one to be proud of.
43825,"Oh, I'm so glad you stuck with it."
43826,It's a beautiful dress and you did a great job on it.
43827,"Now that you know you can do it, you're going to have so much fun."
43828,What a lovely dress!
43829,"Your daughter is so lucky to have such a talented Mom, she's going to be the most adorable little princess at that wedding (we won't tell the bride)."
43830,"You did an amazing job, truly!"
43831,"I hope you're feeling proud of yourself, you should be."
43832,That is darling!
43833,She is going to love it.
43834,I am sure she will feel like a princess.
43835,What a wonderful labor of love.
43836,Good job!
43837,Sis here.
43838,Wooooaw!
43839,That is extremely impressive!!!!
43840,I can barely fix small issues and not even a proper way.
43841,This is beautiful and so well done!
43842,I'm so proud of you and I hope your girl can look back fondly on this as she grows.
43843,Have fun at the wedding!
43844,This is amazing!!!
43845,Congrats!
43846,You did a great job

43849,Well done!
43850,OMG its so pretty I might burst.
43851,I love it!
43852,And I want an adult version for me.
43853,This is very lovely!
43854,So special that you made this for your little one!
43855,I want this but for an adult lady.
43856,"Very nice, Sis!!!"
43857,So professional!!
43858,"Hehe, I mean, *sew* professional!"
43859,🧵🪡👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
43860,That's a very good job.
43861,Looks like you picked a satin fabric which is notoriously hard to work with and shows every stitch.
43862,Give yourself a pat on the back!
43863,You did fantastic.
43864,I've always wanted to learn to sew because my mom used to see my sister and I so many fun things when we were little.
43865,She was so talented but she never uses her talent anymore so I thought it'd be so fun to try picking it up.
43866,Unfortunately there aren't people around my area that will teach this skill anymore and I'm not good with videos or books.
43867,"Anyway, keep up the amazing work."
43868,Your daughter will love love love these things more and more as she gets old enough to appreciate them.
43869,I promise!
43870,That is STUNNING.
43871,You are extremely talented!
43872,"Wow, that is a beautiful dress!"
43873,You can be proud of yourself!
43874,Big big hug for you both!
43875,Such talent
43876,"Oh it absolutely lovely, darling!"
43877,You have a terrific sense of style and a great eye.

43894,"That looks fantastic, great job."
43895,I just discovered the next dress I want to sew 😍 This is gorgeous!
43896,What pattern is this?
43897,?
43898,Glad you kept doing what you enjoy.
43899,Perfection will freeze most of us in our tracks.
43900,Enjoy every accomplishment ‘cause you are capable of that and anything a stitch at a time.
43901,You are enough sweetie 🥰
43902,It’s so beautiful!!
43903,I love the color 🥰

43912,"That's adorable, well done you!"
43913,Absolutely beautiful dress!
43914,"I know absolutely nothing about sewing, but I’d recommend cross posting this on r/sewing for some extra love."
43915,Make sure to take plenty of photos of your baby girl during the wedding!
43916,"It's so beautiful,  I'm insanely proud of you!"
43917,"She looks great, and the colors are perfect!"
43918,Looks very classy and yet youthful.
43919,That pink is an absolute delight.
43920,Great job honey!
43921,"Oh my gosh, what a beautiful dress!"
43922,!
43923,Very simple and elegant 👌🏻 I also love that color combination!

43942,Lucky girl!
43943,That is so cute!

43945,This is soooooo beautiful 😍😍😍😍😍
43946,Sibling here!

43948,The drape is gorgeous & the fabric looks so shiny & pretty I’m obsessed with that pink!😍🥰
43949,So beautiful!
43950,"Great job, Kiddo!"
43951,This is gorgeous!
43952,💕
43953,I knew you’d have a project you’d be proud of!
43954,Loved all of your other attempts along the way.
43955,We stumble before we can walk.
43956,"Before we know it, running!"

43964,Your princess will look gorgeous in that.
43965,You did such a wonderful job dear
43966,This is so beautiful
43967,Beautiful job!
43968,Thank you 🥹 I had this sewing machine for almost 3 years now and couldn’t complete even one project.
43969,"The lines were always wonky, I’d get easily discouraged."
43970,"My last project turned out okay, but too small."
43971,It devastated me to be honest.
43972,I decided to try one last time before selling the machine.
43973,And it worked!
43974,Thank you!!!
43975,I appreciate every one of your advices.
43976,"I actually made a mistake with the hemlines around the neck and armholes, I had to cut into it like 3-4 times in order to be able to fold it properly without it being wonky due to it being circular."
43977,Now it kind of looks weird.
43978,"I can PM you, maybe you can let me know what I can do to fix it."
43979,Ohhh I sure hope so!!!
43980,It’s a sign for me to keep it.
43981,Thank you very much for your kind words❤️
43982,I’m honestly not talented at all.
43983,I’m the most average person ever.
43984,Everything I do is “alright”.
43985,"I always wanted to do something for my children, something I never had when I was a kid."
43986,And I felt like sewing was the most bonding experience with my babies.
43987,"I so far only have a daughter, and she’s going to be my little mannequin 😅
Thank you so much for your kind words ❤️🌸"
43988,"She’s so beautiful in it, it makes my heart melt and a little teary-eyed."
43989,Thank you very much ❤️
43990,Thank you so much ❤️🥹
43991,"I really appreciate that, thank you ❤️"
43992,Thank you 🥹❤️
43993,🥹❤️
43994,I’d love to!
43995,Hahah one day when I get a bit better at it I’ll remember to PM you 😁
43996,Honestly it’s just easier to do it on babies since their waist and chest are literally the same size 😃 thank you very much 🥰❤️
43997,"I promise, if I get better at this I’ll make one for you and send it to you!"
43998,Thank you so much!
43999,I’m honestly impressed that I didn’t set the whole desk on fire and didn’t sew my own finger onto the fabric.
44000,🫠
44001,"Trust me, even though it’s frustrating and hard at times, YouTube helps a bunch."
44002,"I have ADHD, it’s really difficult to concentrate and comprehend visuals like that, but if I can, you definitely can too!"
44003,Somewhere deep inside of you there’s a talented seamstress waiting to be noticed ❤️❤️❤️
44004,Thank you!
44005,"Please, I’m just a very very beginner."
44006,It’s all YouTube and a thousand mistakes.
44007,"If I can, anyone can too!"
44008,Thank you very much 🌸
44009,Would you believe if I said there wasn’t one?
44010,"I measured my daughters armholes, chest and back, length and waistline and just drafted a basic bodice pattern."
44011,In the back pattern I just drew a straight line from the shoulder line down to the spine leaving around half an inch of seam allowance.
44012,When I cut the bodice I just snipped it in the middle to be able to overlap the back panels at the bottom making them look more sleek.
44013,The skirt is a simple full circle skirt!
44014,If you want I can pm you my bodice pattern for reference.
44015,Thank you so much for your compliment!
44016,"I truly hope that you’ll be able to make the dress that is more beautiful than this one, and it’ll fit you like a on a princess❤️"
44017,I needed to hear what you just said.
44018,"I’m not the OP of course nor even a sewer, but there is great wisdom in your words."
44019,Thank you 🙏
44020,SOOOO awesome that you stuck to it despite feeling discouraged!
44021,Your perseverance is admirable.
44022,I'm glad you kept trying!
44023,All those times you sucked were just practice for when you didn't.
44024,"Or, as my mom says, ""the first one is the worst one"", meaning you can only ever get better at a skill."
44025,It looks like you got there in the end!
44026,To properly sew a neckline or armhole.
44027,"Several things. 
 .  Do a basting stitch slightly before the seam line along the curve."
44028,This stabilizes material especially silk.
44029,Then sew the seam.
44030,Then cut a few little triangles into seam side.
44031,And then carefully press out the seam.
44032,Another trick cut away half of one seam edge.
44033,Reduces bulk.
44034,Use an arm attachment on ironing board for best results.
44035,Use paper to not indent onto dress side if silk or satin.
44036,And then turn it out and in repress along the seam.
44037,It should lay nice and flat now.
44038,If it sticks out curvy or wavy it’s because a basting stitch wasn’t used and you sewed too fast and stretched the material out.
44039,Hope this helps.
44040,Sure
44041,Bro to sis... Don't ever call yourself average.
44042,The love and effort are superior and the finished product is adorable... Makes you just want to pick her up and squeeze all the love into her!
44043,Nicely done 🙂
44044,"I cannot sew a stitch so when I see a lovely dress like that, that you made with your hands, it is absolutely a talent."
44045,"Sometimes it can be hard to take a compliment, but this Mom wants you to accept that you are talented and go forth into the world considering yourself such, no more of this ""average"" business."
44046,"I always say that anyone can sew, it's just construction with fabric."
44047,"As you gain more experience, you'll get better at realising how the construction works."
44048,"No -one knows how to build a brick wall in one day, they spend time building other walls and practicing."
44049,The dress is beautiful and a testament to your skills!
44050,"Can highly recommend Tah Dah patterns for little girls dresses, i made [https://www.tadahsewing.com.au/collections/patterns/products/tea-party-dress-pdf-pattern?variant=22898369671](https://www.tadahsewing.com.au/collections/patterns/products/tea-party-dress-pdf-pattern?variant=22898369671) this for a young lady once and it was a really good twirly dress for every day <3"
44051,If nothing else your perseverance is well above average!
44052,Excellent job!!
44053,!
44054,Little bro here.
44055,"I know it’s tempting to see yourself as only average, but your kids certainly will not see it that way."
44056,"The dress is fantastic and shows so much love and effort, they see you as this amazing, admirable, skilled, go-getter who makes them feel taken care of."
44057,Especially in a world where many moms don’t even try.
44058,"Also, you didn’t follow a template, you designed this dress."
44059,"That’s objectively impressive, especially for your first time."
44060,"This is just the start, there’s so much in store for you"
44061,">sew my own finger

I've done that and I've been sewing for years now."
44062,10/10 do not recommend.
44063,Huge congrats on avoiding that.
44064,"Ok so if I’m reading this right, 
you DESIGNED the dress!"
44065,Let that sink in.
44066,Well done!
44067,🥰 virtual hugs - hope all is looking up with you 🙏🏽
44068,Thank you 🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️❤️
44069,😨 oh.
44070,My God.
44071,I’m glad I didn’t.
44072,How did that happen to you and what did you do after that?
44073,Thank you!
44074,"I was gathering a bodice with shirring elastic and paying too much attention to how it was gathering and not enough to where my extremities were (Side note:- i remember the possibility being mentioned in a sewing group and thinking, ""wow, how silly do you have to be, I can't imagine ever paying so little attention to where my fingers are while sewing"")."
44075,"Thankfully I had my hands rotated enough that the needle caught the side of the pad of my middle finger, rather than through a nail bed and I was using quite a light needle that broke so it didn't cause anywhere near as much damage as it could have."
44076,Still gave me a shock and plucking needle fragments out of my fingertip is something I hope to never have to repeat.
44077,"If you're concerned about the possibility, they make finger guards to prevent you getting your fingers close enough to catch them."
44078,"Duckling, I am *so* proud of you!"
44079,"My own mother is an addict, and she’s never stayed clean, and watching her struggle means I have seen how difficult it is, and I could not be prouder of you!"
44080,Hey kiddo - first of all - Bravo for sticking to your decision to stay clean.
44081,And second - this may come across as lame - but I think it was Mark Twain who wrote that the weakest of all weak things is a virtue that has not been tested in the fire.
44082,You are the person you are *because* you overcame addiction.
44083,You are stronger and better and wiser because of your journey.
44084,This is a true victory.
44085,This is exactly what life is about.
44086,Conquering weakness.
44087,Take a victory lap dearest and don't you dare doubt yourself or your value.
44088,"Oh, hon, that's so hard!"
44089,Yet you're doing so well!
44090,I'm proud of you.
44091,You're making good choices for yourself.
44092,There's nothing wrong with seeking support when you need it.
44093,That's exactly what healthy families do.
44094,"They're there for you, though lots of times they don't know how to help until you ask."
44095,"It's good that you tried to connect, sometimes knowing someone who got out makes a huge difference for someone recovering."
44096,You had no way of knowing that they weren't ready yet to be the sort of friend you deserve.
44097,It's possible they'll never get there.
44098,It's not your responsibility to change them or even to reach out to them in the future.
44099,It's your job to take care of you.
44100,To continue to make those good choices.
44101,I'm so glad you have a wonderful partner to stand with you.
44102,It's probably hard for them to consider how much it would hurt if you relapsed.
44103,"A normal reaction to this from them will be panic, then relief mixed with coming down from the adrenaline response."
44104,"That can be rough, but I'm sure they'll be there for you as they go through it."
44105,You can lean on each other because you have built a strong relationship.
44106,That's beautiful.
44107,"Remember to give yourself credit for all the effort you have put into becoming a healthier, happier, person."
44108,You are doing really well.
44109,It's just extra hard today.
44110,You're going to get through this.
44111,Recognizing the spiral is the first step to stopping it.
44112,"OMG I AM SO PROUD OF YOU

You can't imagine how proud I am of you

I would jump up and down and dance around you and hug you if I was with you."
44113,"Oh honey, you passed the HARDEST TEST EVER."
44114,"What a terrible ""friend"" the other person is."
44115,He relapsed (if he ever was in recovery) so he wanted company in his misery.
44116,Block him forever--he's not your friend.
44117,But LOOK AT YOU.
44118,You said NO.
44119,"YOU ARE CLEAN and with the temptation right in front of you, you stayed clean."
44120,"And please, please, don't feel shame at your former self."
44121,"You were in pain, you got into the trap, and you GOT OUT."
44122,"I think there's a lot that happened emotionally here, and your emotions are triggered.... but please don't feel anything except PROUD OF YOURSELF."
44123,"If it helps, let me just share how I feel as a mom of a son who is struggling."
44124,"My own son is still in the mists of his addiction, has been for years now, and if he could just get clean.... and stay clean... and then resist temptation.... how happy I would be."
44125,I wouldn't care for one second about the past.
44126,The past would be past.
44127,"I wouldn't think ""he was undeserving,"" I would think ""I am so happy my son has his life back, I am so happy I have my son back."""
44128,It's all I hope for.
44129,I am just so proud of you.
44130,I am a mom of a deceased child who died of a heroin overdose.
44131,I know first hand how difficult your struggle has been.
44132,But now you are doing awesome!
44133,You set boundaries for yourself and stuck with them.
44134,Good for you!
44135,The guilt and/or shame you feel is your brain lying to you.
44136,Don't believe it.
44137,You have nothing to be ashamed of and everything to be proud of.
44138,There are many mothers out there who wish our child had the strength and courage you do!
44139,Overcoming addiction is the hardest battle anyone can fight.
44140,And you did it!
44141,Keep it up!
44142,I’m a mom and I want you to know that I’m proud of you.
44143,You must have such strength of character to overcome all you have in your life.
44144,It takes a lot of courage to face your demons and it seems as though you’ve walked away stronger.
44145,You did great!
44146,We all have a past.
44147,A lot of people aren’t proud of everything they did.
44148,"But you did what you can, you didn’t do it today."
44149,Staying clean is incredibly difficult and I’m proud of you.
44150,Oh I'm so proud of you darling.
44151,"And yes, you are fishing for validation, and you SHOULD."
44152,This is how it works.
44153,"None of us can be your real mom, but if we could this is exactly the kind of thing you could come to any one of us with and get the congratulations you deserve."
44154,You've come so far dearheart.
44155,"You even let down your guard and assumed the best of your old friend, that was so brave."
44156,Him not being ready doesn't change how impressive -you- are.
44157,"And you faced down that temptation, that temptation that got baked into your brain before you even knew better, and said no."
44158,You kept the person you've worked to become safe and well.
44159,You've saved us from a world dimmed by your absence.
44160,Thank you baby.
44161,Keep taking that great care of you.
44162,You are worth taking good care of..
44163,You are AWESOME!!
44164,So proud of you!!
44165,"Quick little story for that ""shame"" you feel... i work on a hospitial campus."
44166,"Looking out of the windows, the infamous methadone door."
44167,You probably know .. the one that locks if you are late?
44168,I would show my students that door.
44169,"Tell them...watch who goes in... not her, thats a grandma.. not him...he's one of the doctors... not her, shes pushing 3 little kids...."
44170,YES.
44171,All of them.
44172,"All walks of life my love, i tell the students becareful...one wrong turn, you'll be walking thru that door."
44173,So happy for you!
44174,!
44175,[deleted]
44176,"Hey, I am so incredibly proud of you!"
44177,"You deserve to feel proud of yourself, too."
44178,"Like, seriously really proud of yourself."
44179,Doesn't it feel good to stand up and make good decisions for yourself?
44180,"You faced something hard, and you did the right thing, and that is amazing!"
44181,"I may not be your mom, but I am A Mom, and I am literally sitting here with a big smile on my face because of how well you did."
44182,You have inspired me with your story!!
44183,"Even if you don't feel great, you still did great, and eventually you will feel it."
44184,That’s amazing!!
44185,Congrats.
44186,You should be so proud and confident rn.
44187,That is some damn impressive shit.
44188,Fish all you want… you deserve all the praise you can reel in because you know what?
44189,The MAJORITY of those people turning up their noses at drug addicts or even former addicts have NEVER had to do anything as hard as what you did.
44190,"I don’t care if they’ve had surgery or fought off a robber or even been in war (well, I do care, but I’m not as impressed as I am with what you did) because fighting willpower is harder than fighting any external enemy."
44191,Self doubt and shame make the fight unfair and you.
44192,Won.
44193,Anyways.
44194,"Even if you fail in the future, you can remember this because I know it was damn hard."
44195,"You’ll remember you did it once, you can do it again."
44196,And don’t you dare feel shame.
44197,You are a victim.
44198,"I am filled with rage for the child you were and the people who hurt you, and I’m glad you clawed your way out so you broke the cycle and didn’t bring any kids you have it will have into your past hell."
44199,"Stand tall, you are one hell of a fighter, even if you feel weak."
44200,Don’t believe that you are weak… that’s the enemy talking and he won’t win.
44201,"Big sis here, definitely proud of you for making the wise choice, hard as it can be."
44202,"It’s okay to not be okay, it’s normal to feel a bit rattled by something like this."
44203,"Seeing someone from that period of your life and seeing them struggle is probably bringing up memories or associations you haven’t touched in a while, and it’s gonna sting a bit."
44204,Be gentle with yourself!
44205,"Little brother here, I was also an addict."
44206,I’ve been clean for 9 months now.
44207,"I’m proud of you for staying clean, you and I both know damn well it’s a real struggle staying clean and sober."
44208,I’m so glad you stuck to your guns and didn’t take the bait.
44209,I too feel shame at times for being a junkie but then I remember the progress I made.
44210,Keep being sober and keep going ❤️
44211,This is a huge deal.
44212,You should be so proud!
44213,That takes a lot to say no!
44214,I am proud of you!
44215,You have grown to be a strong and resilient adult through the difficult choices you made to change and have a healthy life.
44216,"You were a child, at a very impressionable age, without the tools to resist becoming an addict—it was never a choice you made."
44217,"Far too many people are, sadly, unable to stop self-destructive patterns of behavior."
44218,You are a success.
44219,Hold onto who you are now.
44220,Past mistakes do not define us as we move forward and enjoy a healthy life.
44221,"If your partner is upset because they're scared, please ask them to read all these comments."
44222,With virtual hugs and respect from the momma of an alcoholic daughter who's been sober for 3 & 1/2 years.
44223,"(Unbeknownst to me at the time, her father started letting her drink when she was 12.)"
44224,"Oh Sweetheart, I'm So PROUD of YOU!!!!!!"
44225,"You did such a good job of not giving in to temptation, and forgetting about all your hard work."
44226,"You deserve your happiness that you've made, and so much more."
44227,"Heroin has taken so much from your life, and it doesn't deserve any more of your time or energy."
44228,"I love you, little duck."
44229,"I know how difficult it can be, from watching family members and how it affected them."
44230,My inbox is open if you want to talk.
44231,Be kind to yourself.
44232,"Big mom hugs, if you want them."
44233,Wookie uncle here.
44234,You did yourself proud.
44235,"You stood on the edge of the abyss heard the call to ""jump"" and then turned away."
44236,I'm proud of you.
44237,Now go hug your cat.
44238,Im so proud of you 🖤🖤🖤
44239,"Oh, I am unbelievably proud of you!"
44240,Staying clean in that situation is something to be proud of.
44241,My late BIL was an alcoholic.
44242,"Pretty much every time he would get clean, he'd want to go show off his recovery to his old friends - and he would relapse."
44243,Every.
44244,Single.
44245,Time.
44246,Good on you for not falling into that trap.
44247,"This is a huge accomplishment, and I am super proud of you."
44248,I imagine the shame is hard to shake; I wish I could take it from you.
44249,[Maybe the first rule of Italian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTVDpOaTGsc) driving can help?
44250,Hugs.
44251,"You weren’t tempted by fate, no , you were tempted by an old ‘friend’ holding a road sign saying “this way home” & you had not only the sense but the determination to leave that so called friend on the side of the road while you continue to rebuild your life brick by brick."
44252,Proud of you?
44253,You bet I am!
44254,!
44255,Woohoo!
44256,You did it!
44257,"You stayed sober under some unrelenting pressure, and I'm so proud of you!"
44258,"No ""fishing""."
44259,You've got this.
44260,Proud of you!!!
44261,!
44262,So proud of you!
44263,!
44264,"You just fought the devil and came out on top, can't think of a better reason to feel proud."
44265,I got clean in 1988.
44266,"Trust me, sweet child, when enough years go by as you stay clean, the shame and the bad memories will fade to the point where the old you will seem like a completely different person."
44267,"You did great, and I'm so proud of you not just for staying clean, but for having the self-preservation to block your former friend."
44268,I hope your friend restarts his sobriety.
44269,Let go of your self-loathing.
44270,"You made mistakes in the past, but you’re making the right choices now."
44271,That’s what matters.
44272,"Fish away honey, I’ll gladly take the bait!"
44273,You are amazing.
44274,Being sober from heroin is no easy feat!
44275,"You are a hero to your future self and to me, my  dear."
44276,Stay strong Be proud!
44277,This mom is:)
44278,"Love, I am so proud of you."
44279,You faced an incredibly difficult test- and passed with flying colors.
44280,It’s clear by the way you write that you are super emotionally intelligent and committed every day to walk this path.
44281,"Very, very well done!"
44282,Also… I may have to cop that idea of physically writing nice comments from redditors/online friends!
44283,"I have a folder in my Photos where I put my “happies,” compliments/kind things that make me smile 🖤"
44284,That.
44285,Is.
44286,FANTASTIC!!!!
44287,Well done!
44288,"It can be hard to find out that friends we’ve left behind need to stay in the past, but it has to be done."
44289,I’m so proud of you.
44290,"I can't be your mom for a minute, but Ill be your sister for a minute."
44291,I'm so proud of you.
44292,You should feel pride in the depths of your soul.
44293,"You chose you, not the drug."
44294,You chose life.
44295,I'm truly proud of you.
44296,Another mom checking in to tell you how proud I am!
44297,"Im teary eyed here, reading your story."
44298,"This is not small, don’t think like that!"
44299,We are here for you!
44300,Anytime.
44301,"Regarding your partner, I don’t know how long you’ve been with them, but if they haven’t been a part of this past and if drugs are not something they’ve had in their life one way or another, maybe they could benefit with reading up on addiction and sobriety, maybe even try to go to a group?"
44302,"I think it’s totally normal they’re freaking out a bit, they were just reminded of your past and it’s scary."
44303,"You’ve lived with it your whole life, but I’m sure they just started imagining how things could go."
44304,That leads to some big feelings.
44305,Sobriety and addiction is complex.
44306,So they probably need hugs and maybe talk about it.
44307,"Communication in any relationship is key, and I’m proud of you for telling your partner what happened."
44308,Sending you love and hugs.
44309,Kisses from your very proud mother
44310,"I’m not a mum or a mom, but as someone who knows how impossible a struggle addiction can seem - I am so proud of you, you are amazing!"
44311,I'm so incredibly proud of you!
44312,"That must have been so disapointing to bump into an old friend, to have that excitement of reconnecting with someone who you thought you could share in your recovery with, only to have him betray your trust."
44313,I'm so sorry he did that.
44314,I'm so sorry you had to experience any of that.
44315,"That shame you feel is for HIM, not a reflection of you."
44316,"You stayed strong, you did what was right for you and the people you love."
44317,You did everything right.
44318,I lost my brother to an OD.
44319,That pain is so severe.
44320,You have come such a long way and deserve recognition for that.
44321,"Sis, you’ve got an outpouring of good advice here, bud I’d be letting you down to not say good for you to say no to smack."
44322,"It’s not an easy thing to do, so don’t be so hard on yourself."
44323,"I understand you’re still addicted, that doesn’t go away, but that doesn’t make you a junkie."
44324,It makes you someone who overcame it and is moving on.
44325,Oh honey I am so PROUD of you!!
44326,You are facing a gigantic challenge- it’s life altering really- and you are fighting for your life to make the choices that create the life you want.
44327,These are hard things.
44328,You can do hard things!
44329,"You may not like it, it might feel rough to get through, but here you are doing it."
44330,"This is what success looks like, it’s what successful hard challenges can feel like."
44331,"You are doing good, even if you are not sure of yourself or aware of how great you are doing."
44332,"But I see you, and I KNOW 😁🙌❤️"
44333,Omg that is something to be so proud of!
44334,I’m extremely happy for you and just know you are doing an awesome job!
44335,Be proud!
44336,We all have a past and you have risen above your because you want better!
44337,Keep it up!
44338,I'm so incredibly proud of you.
44339,You stayed strong and did the right thing.
44340,Sweetheart I am SO proud of you!!
44341,The kind of mental toughness and will power it took to walk away was huge.
44342,Even bigger was talking to your partner so they knew instead of hiding it.
44343,You are deserving of all the love and respect you get.
44344,I’m proud of you!
44345,I’m proud of you!
44346,Hug-a-cat I am proud of you!
44347,Oooo ooo oooo oo ooo oo ooo oo ooo ooooooooo!
44348,(this is the I am proud of you song my mom sang to me that I sing to my kids)
44349,I am **absolutely** proud of you!
44350,You are very hard on yourself.
44351,Being clean is a huge accomplishment and I am impressed that you were able to say no to an old friend.
44352,Stop being so hard on yourself!
44353,You're doing better than most people can even hope for.
44354,"Love, Mom"
44355,BABY!!
44356,I am so proud I could bust!!
44357,You were as strong as I always knew you were!!!
44358,CONGRATULATIONS!!
44359,!
44360,I’m proud of you.
44361,"Good job, baby!!"
44362,You have taken what life has forced upon you and overcome it bravely!
44363,"Ach, I am so proud of you."
44364,"You can't beat yourself up over the past, we all have our flat spots."
44365,You just keep marching forward and building that life for yourself.
44366,You are amazing and you have so much to be proud of!
44367,"Xoxox, mom"
44368,Holy shit that’s incredible!
44369,I can’t imagine the strength and fortitude that took!!
44370,"Good on you, I hope you’re proud."
44371,Beaming inside.
44372,You should be.
44373,OP you should feel incredible about yourself!
44374,"That’s such a tough spot - old acquaintance, realisation/betrayal that they’re not where they told you they were at, potential temptation to the offer, pride/guilt/shame/confusion."
44375,You said no.
44376,You walked away.
44377,That must have been tough but you put yourself first and did it anyway.
44378,I’m incredibly proud of you.
44379,"That's an incredible step in the right direction on your part, and I'm so proud and glad that you made the decision not to go with him."
44380,"You're doing great, and I hope someday you'll feel that too!"
44381,You're brave and amazing.
44382,That was SUCH a hard thing to do and you did it!!!!!
44383,I am so so proud of you 💜💜
44384,Not a lot impresses me but I am super impressed by you.
44385,I have an addictive personality so I know the struggle.
44386,Keep it up!
44387,Hey!!!
44388,I am SO FREAKING PROUD OF YOU!!!!

44391,Staying clean happens one decision at a time.
44392,I am so incredibly proud of you for the choices you are making.
44393,Try to find a way to reward yourself!
44394,"If money is tight, a bubble bath and self care evening is inexpensive."
44395,You could buy a plant you have been wanting.
44396,Or plan a special night out for you and your partner.
44397,The limits are endless.
44398,Just know that you are a wonderful individual that deserves every happiness you can find.
44399,I'm SO proud of you!!!
44400,You are so strong!
44401,"Sweetheart, you have NOTHING to be ashamed of, and everything on earth to be proud of."
44402,What you've done - what you continue to do - is the mark of an incredibly strong person.
44403,I wish you could truly understand how proud we are of you.
44404,I wish that you were even a fraction as proud of yourself as we are.
44405,"The real beauty of life lies in recognizing when you aren't honoring the gift of it, and then changing whatever you're doing to create that disrespect."
44406,"Anything that chains you to a misery - whether that's a drug, or a job, or a partner - is incredibly difficult to get free of, and you've done that."
44407,Please go ahead and celebrate your freedom ❤️
44408,Good job honey!!
44409,And you deserve all the love and respect in the world.
44410,"Hey, hun."
44411,Consider me your sis.
44412,I'm so proud of you.
44413,"I can't imagine how difficult it's been for you, and for you to walk away from the temptation that's right there... That takes immense strength and dedication."
44414,"So, incredibly proud."
44415,"Now that you've flexed that inner strength, I hope you'll do what you'd do after any workout: take care of yourself."
44416,Treat yourself.
44417,Rest those muscles.
44418,Nourish them.
44419,And take a moment to thank yourself for making that choice.
44420,Love you 💖
44421,You should definitely feel proud of yourself!
44422,You did great!
44423,"And I hear you, I don't have a mom, dad, or siblings either."
44424,Please don't feel shame.
44425,"We all make mistakes, and you are doing great now."
44426,You are a badass
44427,Hey sis.
44428,You deserve to feel proud of yourself.
44429,"I know it takes incredible self control to overcome an addiction, especially one as strong as heroin."
44430,I respect your strength and resolve.
44431,Just keep on keepin’ on.
44432,Your past is only as important as you let it be.
44433,"Focus on what you love about the life you’ve created for yourself, and what you want to grow into."
44434,You’re doing great.
44435,Much love.
44436,I’m so proud of you kiddo!
44437,You recognized a situation was unsafe for you and made positive steps to protect yourself and your sobriety.
44438,"I would guess that your partner is upset because you were in that position, or because they weren’t able to protect you from our old friend…or even a little fear that you might have said yes and they’re in their own head with the “what ifs”."
44439,My husband is almost 20 years clean from meth now.
44440,"I have faith in his sobriety, but he works in kitchens - where drugs are a big subculture."
44441,"I work in mental health, so I know how difficult the sobriety journey can be for folks."
44442,It’s always a worry in the back of my head that something can happen.
44443,"We had one somewhat of a close call like yours and though it ended up like yours, a part of my brain wanted to go down the what if spiral."
44444,"Just continue to be open and honest about your feelings with your partner, and you’re gonna be just fine."
44445,Let yourself feel that pride friend!
44446,You earned it!
44447,I absolutely understand your need to be recognized for such resolution to remain sober.
44448,I've been clean awhile myself and work a job where I need to clean up the premises in an area addicts come to get high.
44449,I've found myself staring at bags of drugs plenty of times and instead of taking the opportunity to put them in my pocket I take the opportunity to throw them away and even after years how difficult it can still feel to turn them away.
44450,You did the right thing and that is deserving of recognition!
44451,Listen please.
44452,"You by yourself hour by hour, minute by minute, have achieved something so unthinkably difficult that most people never even try."
44453,You got clean.
44454,"THEN you also built a life, stayed clean, found a love,  and every second of all of that you've, in your head by yourself, made the right choices to remain clean and sober."
44455,I'm crying here because you've earned respect..... your own.... for what you have DONE.
44456,and yet you feel ashamed that the things which brought you down happened.
44457,Still crying with frustration here.
44458,12 years old and it was done TO you.
44459,You deserve respect.
44460,"You deserve to know that what you did to get clean and do every single damned day still, are respectable, admirable actions."
44461,And they are FUCKING HARD.
44462,No not off the hook but you're not claiming that.
44463,"Humility is necessary, accountability is required, strength of conviction is imperative."
44464,And.
44465,"AND, acknowledging what has been achieved is vital,  because in the acknowledgement is an honoring of sponsors, family, friends, others on the same path and those walking next to them, deserve your re- thanks for the assist and that includes you."
44466,Not pride but acknowledgement of just how much it takes.
44467,Keep this granny's educated respect.
44468,"There is no more difficult road, and you are walking it."
44469,Humble does not= unacknowledged.
44470,Okay?
44471,I'm so behind you every step of the journey.
44472,My spirit goes out to you.
44473,Use it for good.
44474,Granny hugs 🤗
44475,You were tested… and you were strong.
44476,You did it!
44477,I’m so proud.
44478,Saying no to heroin as an addict is probably one of the hardest things on this planet so you have every reason to be extremely proud of yourself!

44483,You are awesome for keeping clean!
44484,"It's hard, and you should be very proud of yourself."
44485,Us Moms are all proud of you.
44486,"You didn't do anything wrong, you don't ""deserve"" bad things."
44487,"Ultimately, you are clean because you respect and like the person you are when not using."
44488,HUGS!
44489,I am so so proud of you!
44490,"You are strong and amazing, and your life is going to be great."

44495,One day at a time
44496,"Oh honey, I am so proud of you for making the hard choice and continuing down the road you’re on towards a life you’re happy with!"
44497,Addiction is not your fault and shame is a useless emotion.
44498,You have nothing to be ashamed of here!
44499,You deserve good things and I’m glad you have a supportive partner.
44500,Just sit with these feelings for a few days; they will fade.
44501,"You can do hard things and again, so very proud of you!"

44511,You could have gone back but you didn’t.
44512,"You’re an amazing example of ‘when you know better, do better’."
44513,"Don’t beat yourself up for being an addict, praise yourself for getting better."
44514,Look how far you’ve come!
44515,You’re amazing and I’m so damn proud of you
44516,"hey sis, just wanted to let you know how proud of you i am for sticking it through."

44531,And for 10 years!
44532,That is huge!
44533,It is a BFD!
44534,It shows how strong you are.
44535,Never doubt it!
44536,I am super tired round of you—and you should be too!!
44537,!
44538,"Fish away, this is a huge accomplishment."
44539,Do whatever you need to to convince yourself of that.
44540,I'm happy to add to the validation.
44541,You showed extraordinary strength and did something most people in your situation wouldn't have been able to.
44542,Well done ❤️
44543,I’m so very proud of you.
44544,"Last year, my friend’s husband, who had been clean for years, thought just one time wouldn’t hurt."
44545,He never woke up.
44546,You did it and I couldn't be more proud because it shows how strong you are.
44547,It shows how far you've come.

44562,"matter of fact, you should be proud of yourself every single day you wake up and don’t touch that stuff, so please be proud of yourself <3 !!"
44563,addiction is a disease that many people never recover from.
44564,and growing up around addicts myself and witnessing them dying early from their addictions makes me even more prouder as i have seen first hand how bad it can get.

44598,And was it your choice to take it?
44599,No.
44600,"Not at first, and then of course you became addicted, which heroine is very bad for, heroine and meth are what they warn us about most because of how afflicting they are."
44601,But you made it past that part of your life!

44627,I’m proud of you.
44628,I'm so proud of you.
44629,You really are working very hard to keep drugs out of your life.
44630,I want to hold you and remind you that drug use for you was never a choice.
44631,If you were given it at 12 all choice was taken from you.
44632,I don't care that you kept using.
44633,I don't care that it felt like a choice as you got older.
44634,That choice was taken away from you.
44635,Someone forced that on to you and yet you STILL had the strength to break out.
44636,You are bright and full and strong and enough.
44637,You’re amazing!!
44638,This mum is super proud of you 💖

44640,You have survived a lot of hard things and been amazingly strong.
44641,"You deserve to be proud of what you’ve done, but if you don’t feel that way right now, that’s OK, just be kind to yourself and let the snow globe settle."
44642,Oh sweetheart you have done so well.
44643,How brave to be so strong in saying no!
44644,You really do deserve to be proud of yourself x

44662,That is absolutely amazing and I am so proud of your strength!
44663,"From personal experience I know how hard it is to give it up, and after 9 years I still occasionally have those dreams where I wake up just before I get high."
44664,It really takes unbelievable amounts of courage to turn him down like you did.
44665,"Please don't feel guilty at all for your past, it has certainly made you a much better human!"
44666,"It’s your choices that define who you are, not what is done to you, of done as a knee jerk reaction."
44667,You have chosen to get clean.
44668,You should be proud of yourself.
44669,I am proud of you ❤️
44670,"I'm not so convinced that once you realized what it was, it 
>Was by choice

You were already on that journey and it's easy to pick the easy choices when the hard choices don't even really make sense."
44671,You should absolutely feel proud of you.
44672,"For knowing yourself and your boundaries
For knowing what your choices and consequences are, and making decisions that have benefit to your long term health, goals and relationships."
44673,"You did a wonderful, brave, strong thing and we are all SO proud of you darling."
44674,"Lots of addicts I've known have been pathological people-pleasers, and it's incredibly hard to say no to someone- even when what you're saying no to would do you harm."
44675,"Someone I loved very much struggled with heroin addiction, and he died from an accidental overdose (the usual sad story- he'd been in rehab, clean for a while, ran into a person who was still using, misjudged his tolerance and took the amount he would have been able to cope with pre-rehab... it was too much and he died)."
44676,I'm very very glad this hasn't happened to you- the world is a better place with you in it xx
44677,SO SO SO PROUD!!
44678,You’ve done so well!
44679,I hope this thread will help you but could also be a good idea to go to a AN meeting or book an emergency therapy session to help with spiralling?
44680,"It’s natural that you are, this is a big event!"
44681,"You ARE winning a MASSIVE battle for yourself and your life, keep going Xxx"
44682,"Don't feel bad for seeking validation, sweety."
44683,"This is a victory for you, and you should feel proud of yourself for resisting."
44684,I know *I'm* proud of you.
44685,"Addiction is a disease you'll struggle with your whole life, but you are taking proactive steps to deal with it."
44686,"Understand that you'll probably feel pretty shitty for a bit, because even victories are draining."
44687,"But once that subsides, go ahead and savor the sense of accomplishment."
44688,"You used your tools and your support network to take care of yourself, and showed yourself compassion."
44689,"While you push through the emotions, remember to treat yourself gently."

44708,Addiction is an illness and nothing to be ashamed off.
44709,That’s behind you and you’re making better choices for yourself.
44710,A ‘friend’ wouldn’t ask
44711,I'm so proud of you honey!

44728,So great job!!
44729,!
44730,Well done!
44731,I'm so proud of you for choosing what was right for you rather than being influenced by someone else.
44732,That takes guts.
44733,Never be ashamed of your pasy because it's made you who you are.
44734,And that person is awesome.
44735,I am so proud of you dumpling.
44736,It takes incredible strength in the first place and real in your face temptation has to be the devil to refuse.
44737,I am cheering you on in Essex.

44739,Sending love and puppy cuddles 🖤🖤🖤
44740,You did the damn thing baby!
44741,"I am so incredibly proud of you, I've been in your position amd know how hard it is to fight those feelings and thoughts that pop up but you're doing it."
44742,"Every day is a new challenge but you can do it, I know you can."
44743,"Sending you forehead kisses
X"
44744,You are so amazing and so strong!!!
44745,I AM SO PROUD OF YOU!!!
44746,"i bet that “friend” barely recognized you, and was probably jealous of how healthy you are."
44747,Keep being great!
44748,((Hugs))
44749,Congratulations on walking away.
44750,There will always be temptations.
44751,Don't even turn and look.
44752,Keep going strong..
44753,"I wonder if you are hitting a point where it wasn't really hard to say no, so it doesn't feel like something to be proud of?"
44754,"Your description of the situation, it doesn't sound like you had to fight hard to say no."
44755,"Maybe you understated, because you are used to it."
44756,But you sound just matter of fact about it.
44757,I know you came from a history when that would have been a really hard thing to do.
44758,But it is just so *exciting* to hear you say you are building a life you are happy with.
44759,That made me start my day with happy tears.
44760,"What a wonderful, ordinary, miracle."
44761,I am so very proud of you.
44762,You’re doing amazing.
44763,"Practice some self care, whatever that looks like to you."
44764,Please be gentle with yourself.
44765,You are loved.
44766,This is incredible and you should feel SO proud of yourself.
44767,"I'm 33 too, so while I cannot be your mom, I can be your virtual sister, right?!"
44768,I just want to congratulate you and tell you I'm beyond proud of your strength!
44769,It took a lot of courage to stand up for your principles especially when pressure to give in/conform comes in the guise of friendship.
44770,"You are amazing for saying no, and for what you've achieved!"
44771,👏
44772,I am beyond proud of you.
44773,"I can't know how hard it was for you to turn down that offer bc I haven't walked a mile in your shoes but I know that they say quitting heroin is horrific so I can say I ""know"" it was really really difficult to not go back down that road."
44774,And you did it!
44775,You looked temptation in the face and told it to fuck off.
44776,That is incredible!
44777,You ended up an addict through no fault of your own (and I am so angry for 12 year old you!)
44778,and you conquered it against the odds.
44779,That's HUGE!
44780,"One foot in front of the other and if you go to meetings, don't hesitate to go just to get some in person positive feedback on this experience and reassurance that this IS something to be proud of."
44781,♡
44782,Im a mom in my late 30s.
44783,My baby brother (early 30s) is currently spiraling back into his addictions.
44784,I just want you to know that the fact that you are staying strong brought me a spot of happiness today.
44785,I am SO proud of you.
44786,"Stay strong, little one."
44787,You can do this!
44788,Getting clean is amazing.
44789,Staying clean is fantastic.
44790,I’m proud of you.
44791,You saw how easy it is to fall back and didn’t.
44792,That’s great.
44793,Fuck.
44794,That.
44795,Person.
44796,I'm digusted.
44797,Way to go!
44798,That was an awesome move!
44799,No one wakes up a decides to be an addict.
44800,But an addict has to wake up and decide to be clean.
44801,You did that.
44802,You keep doing that and that is a hard thing to maintain.
44803,But you're doing it.
44804,That's awesome!
44805,"Man, I am so proud of you!"
44806,I’m so proud of you!
44807,That must have been really difficult but you stayed strong!
44808,I hope you’re proud of yourself too!
44809,"More of a sibling here, but I am so proud of you!"
44810,"I know you’re experiencing a lot of feelings right now (probably lots of conflicting feelings), but you made the right choice."
44811,I’m so happy that you’re safe and here with us to write this post.
44812,You did a good thing.
44813,So very proud!
44814,Your brother also was hooked on heroin for 4 years.
44815,Your daughter was hooked on marijuana?
44816,All of you are clean!
44817,"I’m rooting for all three of you to continue to live each day, one at a time."
44818,You’re doing great!
44819,"Hej hun,  no need to feel bad or ashamed."
44820,We all did things when we were younger that we regred.
44821,"Be very very proud of yourself,  addiction sucks and you not only haven't just in 10 years,  but you also said no to an offer of the substance."
44822,"Go celebrate with your partner with something you enjoy to do,  get an ice cream,  see a movie or do something else that you like."
44823,I'm really proud of you.
44824,I want to give you a hug!
44825,It sounds like an emotionally rough couple days.
44826,"You had a big flash back to your previous life, which in my opinion, is normal to feel jarring as you have to put those memories back where they were."
44827,I thought it was a nice idea to catch up with this person who said they were also recovering.
44828,I’m really sorry it ended up going badly.
44829,Please remind yourself that the person from your old life’s memories is no longer “you” - and you showed that to yourself by stepping away and by saying no.
44830,"Also, on behalf of your partner I can reassure you that they are upset that you had to go through this, not upset with you."
44831,"You are very much deserving of support and love and many, many hugs!"
44832,You should be so proud of yourself with how you handled this situation and the life you have created for yourself.
44833,💕
44834,Oh sweetling.
44835,"I am wrapping you in a huge, warm hug right now, whispering in your ear, “You are amazing, you are so special, you are enough”."
44836,I am so proud of you.❤️❤️❤️❤️
44837,"You did good, honey."
44838,Your past trauma tried to catch you off guard but you were too strong for it to take you down that easy.
44839,I'm proud of you for being open and honest with Partner.
44840,I'm hopeful that he's just upset because he's upset this happened to you and that you can lean on him while you sort through the whirlwind of feelings you must be having.
44841,Take extra good care of yourself today.
44842,You used a lot of strength.
44843,Make sure you shore up the sides of your ship before you set sail again.
44844,Take time to rest and drink water and eat something happy.
44845,"Love, Nanny"
44846,"Oh my little love, I am so very, very proud of you."
44847,"For your resilience, for your honesty, for your strength - I have loved several addicts and please believe me when I tell you that all these things are hard-won, and you have to choose them every day."
44848,You *are* choosing them every day.
44849,"I'm just thrilled that you have a partner who is proud of you, baby."
44850,"Creating loving, supportive relationships takes an enormous amount of work, you know - please recognize that you have put in the work to get into a healthy relationship, too!"
44851,"If I were him (and I have been), I would be upset, too - not because you did anything wrong, but because someone I cared about was vulnerable to hurt, and is having a hard time."
44852,"You know him best, but would you  consider talking to him and sharing that you're feeling vulnerable in your relationship with him and with yourself?"
44853,Try to be present with him (and not the shame) - and trust that he knows his feelings best and is trying to be honest with you too.
44854,"You've probably heard this a million times, but I found the concept that addiction is ""cunning, baffling and powerful"" has really stuck with me and helped put things in perspective."
44855,"You've experienced a great deal of trauma at a young age and it is absolutely textbook for shame to become a protective armour to help make sense of the ways that your caregivers/adults in your life have failed you, and to keep you physically and psychologically safe."
44856,"You don't need this armour any more and you are learning to let it go, but it's a process, and usually a little messy, nothing you are doing wrong."
44857,"Your feelings of shame and undeservingness are not true, but they are real, if that makes sense."
44858,"Try to sit with them, notice them."
44859,Journaling on reddit and reflecting on other peoples' perspectives is an excellent strategy for self-care.
44860,You are so brilliant and resourceful!
44861,"I love you, and I believe in you."
44862,And you deserve all the love in the world.
44863,<3
44864,You passed that up so well!
44865,Virtual pat on the back.
44866,Great job staying strong & kicking something that you started at such a young age that many ppl never are able to quit.
44867,Hey.
44868,I’m sober.
44869,I was a 24/7 drunk.
44870,Not cute.
44871,Also a drug addict in recovery.
44872,Heroin I did once and I would be dead if I’d done it again.
44873,I loved it.
44874,I didn’t have access and my bf who did said no.
44875,I’m really grateful to be sober.
44876,I don’t know if I’m proud because it feels like a gift but I am not down on myself for what I did.
44877,You can’t be.
44878,For some of us it actually saved our life at the time to live through the unbearable.
44879,Others it’s a genetic thing.
44880,Don’t look back in shame.
44881,You know most don’t make it.
44882,Go forward.
44883,Give back and be grateful.
44884,So proud of you!
44885,Congratulations on this victory!
44886,I am so proud of you!
44887,Sending you the biggest hug.
44888,"I am so proud of you, kiddo."
44889,I am sorry you had to deal with that situation.
44890,Look at how strong you are!
44891,!
44892,In this case I'm a wife for a minute instead of mom since my husband is also a former heroin addict.
44893,He's been clean for 7 years but we recently had a discussion about what he would do if this type of situation came up and whether he's beyond the point of relapse.
44894,The proven answer from anyone in recovery is that you never are really over it completely.
44895,You could have given in.
44896,You could have convinced yourself that one more time wouldn't hurt....but you didn't.
44897,"Whether conscious or not, you made the decision that it wasn't worth it."
44898,Your current life is worth more to you than chasing the high you used to find.
44899,"Whatever your reasons for using in the past, you have more reasons not to now."
44900,Be proud of yourself for the journey you're on and how far you've come.
44901,Appreciate your partner and try to understand that you are absolutely worthy of love and support.
44902,Your partner is probably upset because they are scared of the what ifs that could have changed both of your lives.
44903,Give yourself and them some grace.
44904,I am So fucking Proud Of You!!
44905,"You did the hard thing, THE HARDEST THING TO DO!"
44906,"You were forced into a life you didn’t ask for and you NOT ONLY SURVIVED, YOU THRIVED!"
44907,So proud!
44908,sibling here: I AM SO PROUD OF YOU!!
44909,Addiction and staying clean is so so so hard and saying no is even harder (I got addicted to Percocet) and you did it!
44910,You did something so hard and passed it with flying colors!
44911,I cant express how proud I am through words dude other than *i am so proud and happy*
44912,I’m so proud of you!
44913,"I also got clean in my early 20’s, I’m 5.5 years clean now."
44914,It’s so hard but so worth it!
44915,Wow!
44916,That’s amazing!
44917,"You made daddy very proud of you for that, darling."
44918,Mom is beaming too.
44919,"I imagine that was kinda hard, and please don’t diminish the accomplishment of the now with your feelings about any mistakes of the past."
44920,"Now is now, your life, the past is gone and you don’t even have to remember it anymore if you’ve moved on and have now become healthy and strong."
44921,"I have so much to say to you, but just on a quick break from work."
44922,"As a woman whose husband’s addiction still cycles round and round today, I AM SO PROUD OF YOU, AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONFLICTED FEELINGS."
44923,"Here’s the thing, Love."
44924,Those feelings you are having??
44925,They are a huge part of what makes YOU SO STRONG.
44926,You are choosing to stay clean EVEN THOUGH.
44927,People aren’t heros for avoiding urges they don’t even have.
44928,"As an addict, those feelings will ALWAYS be there from time to time."
44929,Which is EXACTLY why I love you and am SO PROUD OF YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE.
44930,Especially EVERY MOMENT since that old friend showed up!
44931,"I lost my beautiful, compassionate, empathetic, sweet 17 year old boy to Sudden Arrhythmic Death syndrome February 1."
44932,"Just a freak, genetic thing that took him from me in an instant."
44933,"You cherish life every day, and keep that beautiful heart of yours beating for me, okay?"
44934,Mom <3
44935,I.
44936,Am.
44937,So.
44938,Proud.
44939,There is no shame in your past.
44940,"At 12, you did not choose to be addicted."
44941,"At 23, you closed the chapter of your life that included a decade of abuse, addiction, and pain."
44942,That is in no way shameful whatsoever.
44943,It might feel that way because you regret that chapter but you have fought to be here where you are now.
44944,You have struggled and persevered.
44945,You do that every day you reject returning to that chapter.
44946,You deserve every bit of it and you deserve to be proud of yourself for not just building those future for yourself but protecting it.
44947,"With your choice, you protected yourself, your partner, and who you will be."
44948,"You have been honest, sought support, and are actively reflecting on your choices."
44949,"Most people, addiction entirely aside, struggle to do that and do it wholely."
44950,You are doing so incredibly well and I am so proud of you.
44951,That chapter of your life does not define you.
44952,You don't deserve any less love or celebration just because it's a part of your life.
44953,You are a whole and valid human being who is actively writing goodness into existence with your choices and that's the most anyone can be asked to do.
44954,You deserve to be here.
44955,"Oh my goodness honey I am so, so proud of you for being strong!"
44956,"There's no shame in who you are, and 12 year old you would be so happy to see you doing the work!"
44957,"It wasn't your fault, and I'm not ashamed of your past in the slightest, I'm just glad you're here with us today, fighting for a better life!"
44958,*hugs*
44959,You made the right decision.
44960,Give yourself permission to let go of the guilt.
44961,You can Forgive yourself.
44962,We support you.
44963,You did real good.
44964,That was some amazing willpower kiddo!
44965,You did so great!
44966,"This Mama is proud of you, absolutely!"
44967,We want to be your cheerleaders!
44968,Always come here!
44969,Honey I am SO proud of you!!!
44970,That’s a big thing.
44971,"-dadforaminute

You made a great choice and learned a valuable lesson… Not all friends are good friends."
44972,"Also, don’t feel bad about who you were… you can’t change the past, you can change your future."
44973,Super proud of you!
44974,"Hey big sis, my dad died of an overdose several years ago because of “just one more time.” It would have meant the world to me if he were strong enough to turn away his addictions for me."
44975,And so the fact that you were strong enough to turn him away makes me really happy.
44976,"I’m glad you’re still here, I’m proud of you and of your recovery, of your strength."
44977,You should feel nothing but pride in yourself.
44978,Thank you.
44979,🤍
44980,Oh my goodness baby I am SO SO SO PROUD OF YOU!!!!!!
44981,"You are amazing, I’m crying happy tears 🥹 you’ve got this love!!!"
44982,!
44983,I am SO FREAKING PROUD OF YOU.
44984,"I literally have goosebumps right now, that's how happy I am right now."
44985,"I wish I could transfer some of this feeling over to you, because you truly should be proud of yourself."
44986,"I cannot imagine how hard that must have been, and you freaking DID IT."
44987,I'm celebrating you today- you deserve it.
44988,Keep it up!!!
44989,!
44990,You don't need to be ashamed.
44991,"You never CHOSE to be a junkie , I don't think anybody does."
44992,You've improved your life drastically and you're so strong for keeping it that way.
44993,I am so proud of you.
44994,What you did was hard.
44995,Stop beating yourself up for something you cannot change.
44996,"It happened, you wouldn't be where you are or who you are today without it."
44997,Mom here.
44998,I am beyond proud of you.
44999,Kicking heroin is not easy and you've made it 10 years!
45000,Good job walking away from toxic people and resisting temptation.
45001,I could not be more proud of you!
45002,!
45003,"Oh my god, baby, what you did was incredible!"
45004,You have enormous strength to not fall back into addiction.
45005,Not everyone has that in them and you do.
45006,I am so proud of you!
45007,Sending you a virtual mom hug.
45008,Hi honey!
45009,What you have done with your life is truly remarkable.
45010,I am so proud of you.
45011,Look at you kicking ass and creating a life you are also proud of!
45012,Hug hug big ol hug.
45013,xxx
45014,"Oh my goodness, what an incredible achievement!"
45015,"To not only have gone clean and gotten yourself away from heroin, but to keep those boundaries firm when it is offered back into your life!"
45016,"And you've done all the right things, reaching out to your partner for support in a difficult time and communicating openly and honestly."
45017,That is so admirable and honestly what I wish for everybody.
45018,"You are so strong and so confident, making your decision and sticking by it for more than ten years."
45019,The struggles you've been through and the good life you've made for yourself from that pain is more than proof enough that you deserve the support and love of all of us as well as your partner.
45020,"Don't ever undervalue yourself darling, and keep up that clean streak!"
45021,We're all rooting for you!
45022,YOURE AMAZING AND I’M SO PROUD OF YOU!
45023,!
45024,Wow that must have taken some serious strength.
45025,So proud of you!
45026,Big sister here~ good job and thank you so much for saying no.
45027,"A lot of people don’t realize that small relapses are actually more likely to kill you, your body is no longer accustomed to the drugs so even if you do less than you used to you can still overdose."
45028,So thank you for saying no and for still being here 💜
45029,So fucking proud of you 🌸
45030,I’m really proud of you.
45031,I'm so proud of you!
45032,Addiction recovery is one of the hardest things to do as is saying no to temptation.
45033,Congratulations on your incredible strength!
45034,Getting sober is hard.
45035,Staying sober is even harder.
45036,I’m SO proud of you for those ten years.
45037,"That’s three thousand six hundred and fifty or more days that you woke up
and chose not to use!"
45038,That’s huge!
45039,I’m even prouder of you for facing down temptation and coming out the other side of that still sober.
45040,You’ve achieved so much!
45041,Now let’s address the shame.
45042,You were addicted at the age of twelve.
45043,Too young to understand the enormity of taking heroin.
45044,It was not your fault!
45045,You have nothing to be ashamed of at all.
45046,Even if you have have chosen it as a fully grown and fully informed adult it’s still nothing to be ashamed about.
45047,Nobody chooses addiction because they’re emotionally healthy.
45048,Every single addict I’ve ever met has been either self medicating to pull back some physical pain or to smother emotional pain somewhere in their life.
45049,It is a cry for help by making the internal issue an external issue.
45050,Addicts deserve compassion and understanding and they deserve help to treat both the issue of addiction as well as the foundation of pain that triggered the choice to use.
45051,You are not bad or awful or dirty or any of the things you tell yourself about your addicted period.
45052,You were in pain and you found a way to deal with it.
45053,"I’m
 so sorry that you weren’t given the opportunity to heal that pain before addiction became an option for you."
45054,That is incredible!!
45055,"Just being able to say no, feel like you can be transparent with your partner, and keep clean is a victory."
45056,Don't beat yourself up for being an addict.
45057,"You kept clean, even with some hard-core convincing on your acquaintances part, and that is incredible."
45058,Be proud for your victories and try to make amends for any harm or pain you may have caused.
45059,YAY YAY YAY!
45060,Congrats on staying clean!
45061,That's a really big step to be faced with your weakness and not fall prey to it.
45062,"You won that day, sweetie and I'm so proud of you!"
45063,Rock on!
45064,!
45065,"Honey, you've done so well."
45066,Getting clean and then staying clean is a massive feat and you should feel so proud of yourself.
45067,I'm certainly super proud!
45068,"I know it's difficult to accept support and love from people when you're used to being your own support system, but it's great that you're trying to let your partner be there for you; that's taking a lot of strength too!"
45069,I'm so happy you've found someone to be there for you ❤
45070,You are incredible!
45071,I cannot even imagine the strength it took to turn down that offer.
45072,Just look at how you’ve grown as a person!
45073,I’m legitimately blown away.
45074,Fuck shame.
45075,Shame is a useless emotion anyway.
45076,You’re not a junkie — You’re a warrior.
45077,A light of hope.
45078,You’re the exact person ppl who are struggling dream of being.
45079,You are resilient.
45080,You are tough.
45081,You are brave.
45082,You are courageous.
45083,You are in recovery and never letting anyone take that away from you.
45084,"If I was your Mom, I couldn’t be prouder."
45085,❤️
45086,Sib here-- 10 years clean of heroin is no small feat.
45087,I'm  proud of you for not giving in and removing that friend.
45088,It sucks but you're not the person you were 10 years ago and deserve people who respect your boundaries.
45089,Sendubg good vibes!
45090,💜
45091,Hey sib!
45092,#WOOP!!
45093,Well done for continuing to be so strong!!
45094,#HUGS ❤️
45095,Oh my goodness... let's count the ways that you embody resilience and strength.
45096,You went into recovery.
45097,You have stayed in recovery for over ten years.
45098,You built a new life and have partner that values and cherishes you.
45099,When faced with temptation you recognized the harm it would to do to your life and relationship and removed yourself from the situation.
45100,You were honest with your partner.
45101,Hold your head up and be proud of yourself.
45102,Your past and whatever mistakes you made do not define you.
45103,Each day you are choosing to move past them.
45104,Each day you are growing and learning and choosing a better life for yourself.

45695,"The weight is heavy, knowing I have to do right by them."
45696,2.
45697,That you have CHOSEN your true mom and dad is a greater gift to them than anything they can give to you.
45698,"The love of our children is what fills us up, keeps us going."
45699,At least the good ones.
45700,There are a lot of shitty parents out there.
45701,"I'm so glad you found a mom and dad, a place and a family you belonged to."

45763,that's not right.
45764,I’m not a mam but I am so dam happy for you!
45765,"I can’t imagine the emotions you’re feeling right now but I’m assuming it’s at least a million times what my stepmam and I felt the day I started calling her mam, when I realised that she loved me regardless of the fact that I wasn’t hers (and that I and her son from her first marriage have the same first name, to complicate things more)."
45766,"I have had a quick read through and am glad you’re talking things through with a professional, plus I’m also so happy that your siblings (when it comes to family, there’s no complications to me like step-, half-, adopted-; you’re family, that stuff comes from love not blood or paperwork), have been so supportive and excited too."
45767,"All that and taking a new middle name and your dad’s surname, it’s not even 4am here and this has made my day (and I’m off to a gig tonight!)"
45768,"Man, I know summer is only just starting but I can’t wait for Christmas now; the lot of you getting together and just being your big family."
45769,"I hope to see you around here again, I want updates (I know it’s a throwaway account but there’s always an exception to a rule; I can hope so anyway)."
45770,My heart overflows with joy for you all.
45771,I am so happy for you!
45772,You did the right thing!
45773,I’m so happy for you all!
45774,That part about the names sounds like it meant the world to them.
45775,I am so glad that you were able to find each other and that your siblings were so supportive.
45776,Wishing you all the best

45911,I read yesterday's post as well and I'm crazy pleased for you and think you made the right choice.
45912,The way I understood it from the previous post the bio's were parents and you owe them nothing.
45913,What you have now IS family.
45914,"I think you went the right way about it as well, in asking them for their side it gives you solid ammunition against the brain weasels."
45915,The other kids reaction is pretty solid as well with them referring to protecting you.
45916,It has all been for you to choose but it's an honest offer from them and I love the middle name idea it gives you all an extra layer of connection This sounds like a safe and loving space enjoy your life with them.
45917,I can't see how someone in a previous post would discourage you from experiencing this outporing of love.
45918,"Whoever you are, know that I'm ecstatic for you."
45919,Oh my gosh.
45920,You think stuff like that only happens in movies.

46018,This post made my morning.
46019,":)

Congratulations!"
46020,"Welp, I'm crying now..."
46021,I am so happy you took the leap!
46022,"You deserve a family that loves you, you deserve happiness, you deserve to feel secure and I can't wait to see updates from you when the adoption is official!"
46023,"Enjoy your new official family and enjoy the new, complete you!"
46024,We're here rooting for you!
46025,<3
46026,I saw your original post and was so so worried you would self sabotage this situation due to your past trauma.
46027,I'm literally crying with happiness that you made the leap to allow yourself to be loved by them and become part the family.
46028,You deserve it.
46029,I'm so so happy for you.
46030,Lots of love.
46031,"I was thinking about you and hoping you took that leap, congratulations on your new family

One of the sweetest things I’ve ever seen was what looked like a typical birth announcement, made by a gay couple and their first adopted son, when they legally adopted their second son that went something like 
‘We are thrilled to welcome our son and brother (name of the son)
Weight 42 pounds 
Length 46”

What is your adoption announcement going to say?"
46032,Congratulations
46033,i am so unbelievably happy for you and your family.
46034,congratulations!
46035,"This made my heart happy , enjoy your family & the memories y’all will make ♥️"
46036,Congratulations sweetie.
46037,I took a brief look at your post history.
46038,"Ahem, takes out megaphone:

YOU ARE SO LOVED & DESERViNG OF LOVE."
46039,"You are a valuable person, and it is not dependent on what your productivity is, or what you give other people."
46040,You are amazing just the way you are.
46041,I am so happy for you that you found two kind loving parents that will give you the support and home you need.
46042,I don’t know if this helps.
46043,My brothers friend was orphaned around 14?
46044,Our other mutual friends parents took him in.
46045,As a 4th child.
46046,It’s been almost 20 years now and all that support and love is still there.
46047,There are good people in this world.
46048,Family isn’t always defined by fluids.
46049,You’re going to be ok.
46050,I don't know you but as I read this I teared up because I could feel the joy that you've certainly felt while writing this.
46051,Wow.
46052,It is a huge step for all of you and it's awesome to see such a loving family.
46053,"I'm so, so happy for you!"
46054,Congratulations.
46055,:)
46056,Yay!!!!
46057,I was so scared you'd decline and continue to feel like you dont deserve all this but you do!
46058,You have a family!!
46059,"It'll take a while but I hope you guys celebrate your ""gotcha"" day in the best way ever!"
46060,I'm so glad you took them up on this!
46061,Thank you for updating your internet family!
46062,I hope calling them mom and dad was as awesome as you imagined yesterday.
46063,Love and be loved!
46064,Wow!
46065,"What a beautiful story, I'm in tears at work."
46066,Congratulations on your new family!
46067,!
46068,FUCK YES!!!!!!!!!
46069,I’m so glad!
46070,I am just so damn happy for all of you!!
46071,"This is so beautiful, it’s just filling my heart right now."
46072,Congratulations to all of you!
46073,This makes me so happy for all of you!
46074,❤️
46075,Who cut all these onions??
46076,Jesus
46077,They gave me the best gift they could ever possibly give.
46078,It’s not lost on me the magnitude of their sacrifice to decide to adopt me.
46079,Heck when I offered to split the legal fees they shut that down immediately.
46080,They were adamant it was their responsibility to pay for it.
46081,😭❤️
46082,Awe I still appreciate the thought!
46083,"🙏🏼

It’s just nice to finally have an answer for them and to now feel like I’m in the process of belonging."
46084,I gave them my free award on your behalf.
46085,"Thanks 😊 probably the happiest moment of my life so far

I’m going to have a Mom and Dad again."
46086,"Thank you, it’s surreal sitting here looking at my Mom and Dad......."
46087,Thanks I’m still alternating between tears and smiles.
46088,They gave me the best gift ever
46089,Awe well thanks 😊
46090,"Yea I can’t wait to find out a rough timeline of how long it’ll take, it’s dependent on when we can get a court date for family court, so a lawyer can’t really give a firm timeline."
46091,But it could be a few months.
46092,It’s still just a different feeling knowing tomorrow they’ll have their lawyer start the process.
46093,Plus having my siblings start a group chat and label the chat “[family last name] siblings”  - it’s like it took them less than 2 hours to make that and include me
46094,Thank you!
46095,They gave me the absolute best gift
46096,Thank you 😊
46097,Thank you!!!
46098,"It was hard but worth it

And honestly letting them choose my middle name would mean the world to me on top of having last their last name"
46099,"I’m the luckiest kid, right now I’m just soaking up the comfortable silence as Mom finishes making us all a snack."
46100,While still trying to process that they’re really going to be my Mom and Dad.......
46101,Thanks!
46102,"It’s a lot of emotions to process all at once, I didn’t expect all the feelings I’ve been hit with in the last couple hours"
46103,I’m like switching between smiling ear to ear and happy tears.
46104,Hands down the best feeling of my life.
46105,The first hugs with them after I told them I wanted to agree to the adoption were two of the best hugs of  my life
46106,Thank you!!
46107,"My brother made a group chat with all of us siblings and labeled it “[family last name] siblings” and I don’t think he realizes how much I needed that 

I can’t believe they all kept it a secret for 6-8 weeks"
46108,Thank you!
46109,I keep crying occasionally too!
46110,Thank you!
46111,"It was a hard 24 hours on Mom, Dad and I."
46112,They were waiting to find out if I’d be ok being adopted and I was struggling to decide if I should let them or let my trauma rule my decision
46113,They’re the ones giving me a gift.
46114,"They’re taking on a very broken kid, and they won’t even let me split lawyer costs with them."
46115,I don’t deserve the love they give
46116,"It’s ok, I’m just glad I went with my gut."
46117,Yea when I told them the middle name thing and how I had realized they had never gotta to choose a name for a child together before since they have no biological kids together......the way they looked at each other told me I made the right call on that.
46118,"I’ll be the only one of their children that has both of them on my birth certificate, so I wanted them to get to choose the middle name that I’ll have plus taking Dad’s last name, I know to some that all might seem dumb but to me it lets me move on from my past"
46119,I almost didn’t do it.
46120,I was gonna talk to them at 5 and bailed decided I was going to tell them no instead.
46121,Then after more thinking I decided to just take the risk and let them be my Mom and Dad
46122,Thank you!
46123,Thank you!
46124,"It wasn’t easy, especially because I didn’t know how they would take the middle name thing, but I don’t want the ties to my biological family anymore especially by having my biological moms first name for a middle name."
46125,I want something that has significance to my new Mom and Dad
46126,Thank you!
46127,Thank you!
46128,I hope I make them proud
46129,Thank you!!!
46130,We go to the attorney office this afternoon to start paperwork.
46131,I’m nervous and excited for that.
46132,Thank you!
46133,Thanks!
46134,They’ve given me the best gift possible.
46135,They don’t know it but they increased my sense of security that they’ll stay in my life long term.
46136,Thank you!
46137,Thank you!
46138,Thank you!
46139,!
46140,I’ve been pretty speechless all evening.
46141,"Just soaking in the feeling of having a Mom and Dad, and feeling like I can call them that now."
46142,Even when I just came upstairs to go to bed in the spare bedroom at their house they both took turns coming in for a couple minutes to have some one on one moments with me.
46143,It’s a lot to take in but I’m so thankful
46144,Thank you!
46145,I’m still alternating between happy tears and smiles.
46146,They gave me the best give possible
46147,I almost backed out but finally said I’m going to get hurt anyways may as well say yes
46148,They gave me the best gift possible
46149,Thank you!
46150,Thank you!
46151,Thank you!
46152,Thank you!
46153,Thank you!
46154,Thank you!
46155,Yea and I was gonna tell them at 5 and got scared again and had to talk myself back into it.
46156,"It was hard to get to this point, but deep down it’s what I really wanted"
46157,Thank you!
46158,Thank you!
46159,Thank you!
46160,Thank you!
46161,Thank you!
46162,Thank you!
46163,So glad you had a good experience too!
46164,Thank you!
46165,Thank you!
46166,"It was hard for me to risk it after all the Reddit
Comments that made me scared to go through with it, but I’m so glad I did"
46167,Thank you!
46168,Thank you!
46169,Thank you!
46170,Thank you!
46171,Thank you!
46172,And I’m glad you’ve experienced having a healthy chosen family
46173,Thank you!
46174,Thank you!
46175,Thank you!
46176,Believe I’ll forever owe them everything.
46177,I can’t ever repay them for this gift
46178,Thank you!
46179,Thank you!
46180,Thank you!
46181,Thank you!
46182,Thank you!
46183,Thank you!
46184,🙏🏼💕
46185,"There’s still part of me thats fighting the “relax and be loved part” 

I spent the night in their spare room and me, Dad and Mom all stayed home today to go to the lawyers office later.......Dad brought me coffee and breakfast this morning and I really had to take a deep breath and let him take care of me without fighting it and feeling like I have to prove I’m worth it"
46186,Thank you!
46187,"The middle name thing is something that’s gonna mean the absolute most to me, especially someday when they’ve passed on."
46188,"That part is probably the most sentimental part, losing my bio moms first name as a middle name in exchange for a name chosen by my new Mom and Dad."
46189,Thank you!
46190,Thank you!
46191,"The name is the sentimental part for me especially because if I get married someday my last night probably won’t be Dad’s anymore, so my middle name will still keep that name connection"
46192,Thank you!
46193,Thank you!
46194,Thank you!
46195,Thank you!
46196,Thank you!
46197,Thank you!
46198,Thank you!
46199,Thank you!
46200,Thank you!
46201,Thank you!
46202,Thank you!
46203,Thank you!
46204,Thank you!
46205,"And don’t worry I keep crying too, so does my Mom every once in a while, and Dad’s is big time overprotect/over care mode"
46206,Thank you!
46207,Thanks!
46208,Thank you 😊
46209,Thanks!!
46210,!
46211,Thank you!
46212,Believe me I keep crying too
46213,This one is my favorite onion reference so far 😂 thanks for the smile!
46214,!
46215,Thank you!
46216,🙏🏼🙏🏼
46217,Thank you!
46218,Thank you!
46219,Thank you!
46220,Thank you!
46221,Thank you!
46222,"And I’m trying not to let that eat at me, I’m just so used to being independent since I was kicked out at 17 that I even struggle to let them by my dinner if we go out to eat etc"
46223,Thank you!
46224,😊😊
46225,Thank you!
46226,Thank you!
46227,Thank you!
46228,!
46229,Haha that’s honestly awesome!!!!!
46230,Super cool!!
46231,"And I Have no idea if there will even be one, a lot of people probably won’t be supportive of it due to my age."
46232,Plus right now it’s being kept quiet.
46233,My parents haven’t even told their siblings or my Dad’s Mom.
46234,I haven’t told any friends or anything either.
46235,Thanks!!
46236,!
46237,Thank you
46238,Thank you
46239,Thank you!
46240,It’s definitely a lot of emotions.
46241,In 20 minutes we meet with the lawyer to start everything (like the first set of paperwork).
46242,It’s a surreal feeling that I’ll sign paperwork today to start to become their kid officially
46243,Thank you!
46244,It was the best feeling but also hardest words to choke out all at the same time.
46245,The emotions were high for all 3 of us
46246,Thank you!
46247,!
46248,Thank you!
46249,Thank you!
46250,Thank you!
46251,I’ve been using an onion chopper!
46252,"Sit back, and be loved."
46253,Let them love you.
46254,Let them spoil you.
46255,"As a parent, this makes me so happy."
46256,Life is so much better when you belong.
46257,"It won’t always be easy being a part of a family, but that’s part of the joy of it all."
46258,"The act of being a part of it, good and bad."
46259,Sending so much love
46260,"Sweetheart, you already belong to these people and they are desperate to make you see it."
46261,This is just paperwork.
46262,Just really happy to hear you went through with this.
46263,"They sound like wonderful people that anyone would be lucky to know, let alone be a part of their family!"
46264,I hope you all have a wonderful life together.
46265,And congratulations on belonging to a family that loves you :)
46266,"The day it becomes official, and then the next day and the next, and then when they witness you getting married, or hold your baby (if you want those things) those moments are going to be even better."
46267,You are going to have an amazing future filled with love and belonging.
46268,I wish you nothing but the best!
46269,!
46270,"Not to make light of the process, but at least emotionally it sounds like you already do."
46271,You deserve all the happiness in the world.
46272,Your post made my day!
46273,"Aww, that sounds so sweet about the chat, how quick, and how fun!"
46274,"Just FYI - family courts can be slow, so don't let that process discourage you: it'll happen!"
46275,I know the feeling!
46276,"A couple of weeks ago I got added to a ""-name- tribe"" Whatsapp chat after reconnecting with my bio dad and I have a bunch of extra (half) siblings"
46277,I am very happy for you.
46278,I’ve often found that the hardest things to do are also the most worthwhile.
46279,And you did it.
46280,😊 And I feel like you’ve all earned this new name that will mean so much.
46281,"Honestly, this whole story, and especially your decision (particularly seeing how much you struggled with it), has made my day."
46282,It’s always good to be reminded that there are people like you and your family in the world.
46283,You hit the jackpot girl!
46284,I’m so glad you chose happiness.
46285,Keep making that choice.
46286,You deserve it.
46287,Receiving the love they offer is also a gift
46288,"Hey, bunchkin."
46289,"I know I already commented, but I wanted to say this very sternly."
46290,You aren't broken.
46291,There's NOTHING wrong with you.
46292,"You are a phenomenally strong person who's endured a lot, and so you've had build responses and coping mechanisms to keep yourself safe."
46293,"Some of those won't continue to help you, so we learn to untangle them slowly."
46294,It's a process.
46295,"They are not taking on a broken kid, and this is not charity."
46296,"You're doing great, and I know because you're letting yourself have family who loves you, and that's so hard after people who were supposed to be family teach you that family is scary."
46297,"This is your parents who are desperate to love you, and you letting them do that."
46298,"This is your parents who look at your beautiful face and say ""we are so lucky."
46299,"We just want to help her and know her and be there for her and be part of her life."""
46300,You aren't broken.
46301,You don't need fixing.
46302,Family and therapy and support are things you GET.
46303,You GET to do therapy because you GET to feel secure and treat yourself with love and care.
46304,Of course you deserve it.
46305,There's nothing you could do that would mean you don't deserve your mom and dad loving you.
46306,It's in our bones and our blood.
46307,I watch my (19yo) baby sleep sometimes and think how beautiful he is.
46308,"Even when he rages, when he cries, when he won't talk to me for days on end, when he can't get out of the spin cycle, he's my baby."
46309,"And when his trauma responses kick in, that's my cue to stand solid and love him MORE, because he is entitled to trust that mom means mom, love means love, and there's no bar he needs to meet to earn or deserve it."
46310,He deserves it because he's a person.
46311,He's my son.
46312,He can't lose me.
46313,"You deserve a family that's nuts about you, and I can't think of a single reason you wouldn't."
46314,"Now, that's harder on the inside."
46315,We can see all the yuck and come up with reasons.
46316,"But although the reasons are real, they aren't TRUE."
46317,"And you, in return, are giving them the gift of their daughter, because you ARE a gift, and you are so, so wanted."
46318,And why on earth would they split lawyer costs?
46319,"We don't charge our babies for hospital fees, and if we did, it'd be cruel and abusive."
46320,You aren't a different kind of daughter because you are heart-carried and not womb-carried.
46321,You're daughter.
46322,"Children require time, energy, money, and patience."
46323,Super easy to think you aren't worth those.
46324,Guarantee your parents totally disagree.
46325,They pay the lawyer like they pay the doctor because that's how they get their baby they so desperately want.
46326,And bonus?
46327,They know whom they're choosing with you.
46328,With most babies it's a crapshoot.
46329,"You they know, you they choose, you they love on purpose, eyes wide open."
46330,"Often when young people are adopted into a Jewish family and want to become Jewish, they have to convert."
46331,"Our rabbi looked at our son after hearing his story when he was trying to figure out if he had a right to the rituals of our family and our people, and she said, ""This is so obviously your mom."
46332,You're just home a little late.
46333,Your mom is Jewish.
46334,Kids of Jewish moms are Jewish.
46335,"Of course you're Jewish."""
46336,You are finally coming home.
46337,"This IS your family, even if it took longer to get there than for some."
46338,"Welcome home, baby."
46339,You're not different.
46340,You get unreserved love.
46341,You are not broken.
46342,You have been hurt to the depths of your soul.
46343,But the core of you is whole and precious and you are absolutely worthy of all this love.
46344,You always were- it's just been late in getting to you.
46345,me too <3
46346,"It is not the least bit dumb, it is truly one of the sweetest and most beautiful things I've ever heard."
46347,😭♥️♥️🥲
46348,This really makes me tear up.
46349,They all sound like a wonderful loving family.
46350,I am sooooo happy for you!
46351,That decision is such a healing move for you!
46352,I’m so proud of you!
46353,You are doing so great with this big step!
46354,I’m sure you already are!
46355,This is so great 😊 I'm really happy for you !
46356,"You had the courage and strength to go through this, everything else will be easier after that, you'll see !"
46357,This is your new life and you deserve every bits of happiness in this
46358,You know..
46359,"I would bet they do know that, and intended that."
46360,"They sound like incredible parents, but I think many good parents understand their kids' need for love and security, and will look for ways to provide it."
46361,"Also thank you for sharing your journey and this wonderful news, seriously the most uplifting thing on the internet today!"
46362,I'm really proud of you for not backing out.
46363,"I know it's hard to believe, but you do deserve love."
46364,"I won't promise you'll never get hurt, that's an unfortunate part of being human, but it sounds like this family loves you unconditionally which means they will help you through anything and won't abandon you."
46365,You are a gift as well.
46366,100%
46367,You've been fighting your whole life and it makes sense that it's still hard to get out of that mode.
46368,"Be gentle with yourself, it's ok!"
46369,You're doing so great.
46370,Just keep at it.
46371,This is too precious!
46372,I'm so full of love and joy right now!
46373,Enjoy this moment and every one that follows 🥺❤
46374,"No thank you, I’ve cut all my onions (‘:  seriously OP."
46375,Super happy for you
46376,>Thank you!
46377,You're welcome!
46378,Thank you for sharing your story.
46379,You may never know what you inspired but sharing love is ALWAYS the right answer.
46380,>Thank you!
46381,You're welcome!
46382,You are most welcome!
46383,"This is amazing, your beautiful story has made it to the Best Redditors Updates ❤️"
46384,"It’s Going to be an adjustment for sure to just relax and let them love me and take care of me, plus I do feel bad they’re covering the full adoption costs."
46385,"Yea that’s true, a lot of it is really so that they can protect me legally."
46386,My biological family that is still living has nothing to do with me.
46387,"This family that’s adopting me is all I have, but if something bad happened to me they have no legal ability to advocate for my health care etc."
46388,So a big part of the decision on everyone’s end is that it protects me as their child now in an emergency and when they pass away someday
46389,"Yea I can’t wait for the day I get to officially have the same last name as them, and be their Kid in every way, I know to them I already am, but that piece of paper does help me feel secure"
46390,"And part of me knows I do, but there’s a little more security in it now"
46391,Thank you 😊
46392,"Yea if kinda helped my sense of security to be included that quick by them, it made me feel like they’re truly ok with it"
46393,That so cool!!
46394,it really is weird how something that simple can really reinforce that you’re part of their lives in a good way!
46395,!
46396,For sure!
46397,I definitely don’t deserve it but I hope someday I like up to the standards they’ve set
46398,Yes!
46399,They love being your parents.
46400,It fulfills them and brings them the deepest joy and satisfaction to care and provide for you.
46401,It is absolutely a gift to them to allow them to do so.
46402,"Idk why this has got me all teary but it does, especially your perspective on the lawyer......and they’ve definitely loved me through some hard days."
46403,"Heck Dad and I had our first ever major argument two weeks ago and I was scared to death he wouldn’t want me anymore, but he just has treated me the exact same as always."
46404,It’s just hard for me to adjust to not owing my fair share of a cost that directly is a result of me
46405,Hopefully between this and continuing therapy I keep healing
46406,"I just really don’t want my bio moms name for a middle name, and I want it to have significance to my new family."
46407,(I told them I do get to veto if it’s Bessie or Bertha or something but that otherwise I’m pretty much good with anything as long as it has significance to them)
46408,"They’re all amazing people, way better people than I deserve, but I’m thankful they chose me"
46409,Thanks
46410,"Thanks, they chose my middle name today, and we signed the first round of paperwork."
46411,After the last 48 hours I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed and starting to emotionally and mentally burn out.
46412,Dad offered for me and my dog to stay a couple more nights so they can take care of me/look out for me while I let my emotions and everything stable out since they know if I get overwhelmed with this much stuff I sometimes shut down then I’ll seclude myself at home all alone and shutdown further.
46413,"So I guess I’m staying with Mom and Dad a few more days and going to try to let them baby me a little so I can focus on grounding my emotions again

I’m so happy but I’m also nearing my emotional max"
46414,It’s just hard to process it all.
46415,That they’re really choosing me and not hesitating to start the process
46416,Thanks!!!
46417,I hope they didn’t go this route because of my insecurities.
46418,I hope it’s something they truly wanted regardless of my insecurities
46419,It’s just a change to mentally tell myself I can let them take care of me in those little ways without them expecting me to prove I deserve it
46420,I’ve just been hanging out all day until we meet with the lawyer and just taking in the feelings.
46421,"Everytime I look at one of them I want to cry, and I get choked up every time I say “Mom” or “Dad” because I only used to call them by their first names because I didn’t feel I deserved to call them Mom and Dad before this"
46422,I hope it impacts someone positively
46423,Sweet bot 🏆
46424,Really??
46425,?
46426,I am so happy for you.
46427,I'm so happy for them.
46428,"If you haven't already done it, consider therapy."
46429,Being a real part of a functional and healthy family dynamic is a big change.
46430,"So, so, so happy for you."
46431,Oh my gosh.
46432,Keep us updated.
46433,As a dad i just want to say that you dont need to feel bad at all about the costs.
46434,There is no monetary value on love.
46435,They would do it if it costs nothing or a billion dollars.
46436,"It costs over 10k to have a baby in the US, the adoption costs are nothing greater than any other costs for having a new child."
46437,"Congratulations, what a wonderful post!"
46438,don’t feel bad.
46439,You were supposed to be cared for like this since you were born.
46440,"Now is finally the time to be cared for, sit back and be loved."
46441,This is them taking care of their child.
46442,The first time they get to legally take care of you as their child.
46443,I am certain for them paying the fees is very symbolic.
46444,There's no need to feel guilty.
46445,"Hey, bunchkin."
46446,We just completed this process a few months ago with our nineteen year old.
46447,I remember so clearly the day he asked if he could call me mom; I remember choosing a name with him.
46448,"He's an adult, too, going to college next year, and I'm gonna miss him like crazy."
46449,"I want to tell you this, in case the fear gets in at night:
You ARE their child."
46450,"I've given birth, and I have this boy."
46451,And just because I did not carry him with my body does not mean I don't love him exactly the same way.
46452,"I've held him when he cried, gone to sports games, taken care of him when he was sick, and every moment of it is an honor."
46453,"He was ours the moment he said yes, and the paper still made it feel real."
46454,You are their child in every possible way.
46455,"Our son can't lose us, no matter how hard he tries."
46456,"I'm so, so happy that you have gotten to go home, too."
46457,I am so happy for you!
46458,It is!
46459,"Especially since I live across the world from them, and I won't get to meet most of them for awhile"
46460,They never would have made the offer if you didn’t deserve the love.
46461,You deserve every bit of it - congrats sis!
46462,"Whether or not you deserve it (and you do), they want you there!"
46463,You’ll absolutely do them proud.
46464,"I told my son I was so excited for the day we had our first fight, because he'd get to see the other side and know I love him same as always - and maybe more, because now I know more about him I can love."
46465,"Congrats on your first fight, sweetpea."
46466,That's powerful.
46467,Yes.
46468,That makes sense.
46469,Especially when you've been taught that being just plain cared for is a child's right.
46470,It is not your fair share.
46471,It is part of parenting.
46472,"You're not the parent, you don't pay that cost."
46473,"And it feels like it's a result of you, but its the other way around."
46474,You're a result of it.
46475,"They pay it because they want a paper that says, ""literally no one can question she's ours."
46476,"Come at us."""
46477,They GET to pay for that.
46478,They WANT to.
46479,The lawyer fee is incidental to what's really going on here.
46480,It's an entrance fee FOR THEM.
46481,"They're getting to enter parenthood together, and they get you."
46482,"They'll amend your birth certificate, I imagine."
46483,It'll have their names as your parents.
46484,They are paying for that right.
46485,That isn't your fee to pay.
46486,And they may pay for other things too in your life.
46487,"So when you start feeling guilt about that, ask yourself whether it'd be uncomfortable if your parents paid for your siblings."
46488,"If it wouldn't be, they get to pay for you."
46489,We GET to.
46490,"I'm 34, my granddad and I still fight about who is paying for flights home, and I've lost every fight for fifteen years."
46491,And I go into it knowing I'm going to.
46492,"Right now our son is learning to pay for some fixed expenses himself, which makes me feel like an awful person because I don't want him to feel abandoned, but he does need to slowly learn to budget for that so he doesn't freak out when he's short and stop eating."
46493,And he also needs to know that we're there as a fallback if he needs.
46494,"And that as long as we're all alive, we will continue to give him care and treats and love."
46495,"He GETS to be able to be independent because he knows he's able to stand on his own feet, and not because he has no choice."
46496,"You, too."
46497,This isn't your fair share to pay.
46498,You're not their partner and not their friend.
46499,You're their daughter.
46500,I agree with u/werewolfjrjr - this is in no way dumb.
46501,"You’re doing this out of love which is just beautiful; any meaning, or lack thereof, does not matter."
46502,I am so super chuffed for you OP.
46503,"You’re doing what’s right by yourself and showing the people you love, your parents, just how much you appreciate and love them."
46504,"You deserve them, and I know they will help you learn the truth in that over the years, even though it's hard for you to fully believe it now."
46505,You deserve this.
46506,You deserve a loving family.
46507,"I am so, so happy for you!"
46508,🥲🥲🥲🥲♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
46509,You will make each other happy!
46510,One doesn’t do that lightly.
46511,They really love you very much and I know you love them.
46512,You got the parents you should have had and they got a child (adult child) they chose.
46513,It makes me really happy for all of you!
46514,"Now, now, you deserve to have good people, don't think otherwise!"
46515,Find a good balance kiddo.
46516,There's a lot of big news in your life.
46517,I'm happy for you and your family and you should take some time to feel all the feelings and get your head straight for your new situation.
46518,Good luck!
46519,Yes I understand but that's because they love you haha !
46520,They are your parents now.
46521,"One day, it won't feel scary or unreasonable to say out loud."
46522,You'll feel confident and happy.
46523,This is just the beginning so it's a bit of adjustment.
46524,"It's all gonna be okay, you can trust them, they're here for you."
46525,They wanted it.
46526,"I promise you that, and you know it too, hon, looking at their faces when you said yes and told them about them picking a name."
46527,"Making you feel secure and safe fulfills them as parents, and remember that it gives them a sense of security too - that you're going to stay with them and love them and let them love you, for life."
46528,"Of course, yeah."
46529,It sounds like you're already accessing some good inner resources like with your breathing this morning.
46530,You can navigate this change and keep healing.
46531,We all believe in you ♥️
46532,"That is so sweet, they're honoured to have you as their daughter and I hope you never ever feel undeserving again."
46533,From your posts I can tell you're all stand up people and you've made your parents feel as blessed as they've made you!
46534,"Cry as much as you need and let your emotions do their thing, you've earned this moment OP and you deserve every ounce of it."
46535,"Go to Best of Redditors Updates subreddit, I have such happy tears for you all ❤️"
46536,"I’m in therapy every other week, I was pretty resistant to it for years but about a year ago Dad convinced me to try seeing a counselor he and Mom had seen in the past when moms son who passed was terminally ill."
46537,I have such a similar personality to Dad he said he thought I would like this counselor and I do.
46538,So it was weekly for like 6-8 months and now it’s ever other week.
46539,"Part of me knows that, and they’re at retirement age (early 60’s) and more than set financially but it is frustrating not being able to take some of the financial burden off them."
46540,I didn’t agree to it to make them have to pay it by themselves
46541,Thanks!!
46542,"I mean that’s probably true and it very well could be less than 10K for all this, but I didn’t agree with the expectation that they would pay all costs"
46543,"It’s definitely different than my childhood, they’ve helped me slowly heal through the years they’ve been in my life, but it’s a struggle to sit back and let them spend this amount of money on me"
46544,"Yea maybe it does feel that way for them, but I still feel like they shouldn’t be solely responsible for it"
46545,"I missed this comment until now, and they’ve told me before that I’m loved just as much as their other children, that the bonding process was different because I was 17-19 years old when they met me but that I’m not loved less, it just developed differently."
46546,"They’ve taken care of me after two surgeries, supported my college athletic career they made every game they could."
46547,"They’ve told me a million times I’m “stuck with them” 

Mom told me part of their desire to pursue adoption was after I had chest pains in February and a blood pressure of 196/111 and I need an EKG, chest X-ray and lots of blood work."
46548,I was in the hospital for 10 hours and they wouldn’t let either of them be with me because they weren’t “family”
46549,"Yea I’ll be the only child in their family that has both of their names on a birth certificate, and I’ll also be the only child they’ll ever get to choose a name for together (even if it’s just a middle name)."
46550,"And yea I was homeless at 17 and had to learn early on to be super independent, so I’ve always struggled to let them buy me dinner or accept Christmas or birthday gifts."
46551,I’ve always felt I had to pay my own way.
46552,So this lawyer thing is gonna eat at me.......but your perspective is a huge help
46553,They’re my whole world.
46554,They’re the reason I’m alive today and have been able to become successful
46555,Thank you so much and thank you for all the awards.
46556,It’s not lost on me the magnitude of the gift they’ve given me.
46557,Thank you!!
46558,"My siblings have already started joking with me in a group text that I’m the kid our parents never had together so I’m gonna be babied 😂 they’re like “have fun with that and thanks for taking one for the team for them to be overprotective towards for a while” 

It’s kinda cool how they already made a group chat and labeled it “[family last name] siblings”"
46559,It’s definitely an adjustment.
46560,Even getting used to learning to say Mom and Dad and not use their first names is an adjustment
46561,Yea their reaction to the middle name thing was cool.
46562,"They way they looked at each other like they get to experience something together they never got to before, while also knowing it’s going to be sentimental to me."
46563,I hope I made the right decision by letting them have that chance!
46564,They definitely gave me the best gift possible and I’ll never be able to repay them
46565,"I just went and looked, I’ll read through it later on"
46566,You are doing everything right.
46567,You deserve all the happiness in the world.
46568,❤️
46569,"> when moms son who passed was terminally ill.

You mean when *your brother* passed."
46570,I'm sorry for your loss.
46571,I am sure there things in the future you can contribute to!
46572,I don't think you want to start it with an argument!
46573,"😜

I am so happy that you have found your family!"
46574,Yup.
46575,That's a learned behavior and a growth edge.
46576,I'm glad you know about it.
46577,You're practicing the art of letting people care for you.
46578,"Scary, dangerous, and worth it."
46579,"In the year my son has been home, he's exponentially better at it."
46580,Not over it.
46581,But better.
46582,"When the lawyer thing eats at you, breathe through it and remind yourself lawyer is doctor."
46583,"The fee is... God, who even cares about the fee."
46584,I'd have paid whatever I needed to to get us into that courtroom.
46585,And it was so much less than I thought it was going to be.
46586,"We're not rich,  but we did not give a DAMN about the money."
46587,We got our SON out of it.
46588,I'm so glad to have been able to help at all.
46589,"Also, from your previous thread: 
I sat with my son on a couch when he was seventeen and said, ""would you let us be your family?"
46590,"We love you and we want you and I know it's scary--"" and he cut me off and said yes."
46591,Sometimes you know.
46592,It's not insane to feel a deep love for your parents.
46593,And they are your parents.
46594,And you're their real daughter.
46595,This is just paperwork.
46596,Such joyful paperwork.
46597,You should see pictures from the day our adoption went through.
46598,I'm so happy for you.
46599,"DM any time, ok?"
46600,If the worms are getting into your brain or whatever else.
46601,"We've been through this, and I'm happy to be here for you."
46602,OH.
46603,Name.
46604,"It's not ""just"" a middle name."
46605,It's you asking them to NAME you.
46606,You'll carry that around with you.
46607,Our son is trans.
46608,He'd have chosen his own name anyway.
46609,Lots of kids do.
46610,"That you're opening yourself to what parents often do, which is have some input on names, middle or otherwise, is amazing."
46611,And yes.
46612,It's such a beautiful feeling carrying that name and carrying their last name and knowing that you're really really theirs.
46613,Congrats on the names and the family.
46614,I love that you and your mom and dad get to do this together.
46615,This makes me so happy.
46616,"They're obviously doing a fantastic job and have passed their awesomeness (I'm sure there's a better, less cliché word but my brain can't find it after 5 hours sleep and subsequently walking for 6 hours), onto you."
46617,I wish you all the best in the future and I'm rooting for you all in everything you do.
46618,You've given them an incredible gift too.
46619,It took so much courage for you to finally let yourself have this.
46620,And they are so grateful that you did.
46621,"I'm literally happy crying in my bathroom reading your posts about this, and let me tell you that having the siblings proactively love you too is HUGE and crazy and I'm blown away in thankfulness for your sake!!"
46622,"I know it can be really hard to believe people actually care about you and won't just leave, but having that piece of paper and that groupchat helps as solid anchors to shove in the face of your trauma response anxiety."
46623,"And, it sounds like these amazing people are going to stand with you even if you try to push them away."
46624,You're safe now :)
46625,That is so cool!
46626,you absolutely did  ♥️
46627,❤️
46628,"Sorry, yea it’s still an adjustment to get used to calling everyone names/terms I haven’t before

And thanks it was hard on all of us"
46629,This.
46630,This one is the one that made me tear up.
46631,Haha definitely not since Dad and I had our first major argument 2 weeks ago.
46632,And it was an argument because I doubted his love for me.........little did I know what they had been working in for 3 months
46633,Believe me I wish I had said yes immediately like I wanted to.
46634,But I didn’t then Reddit got me all in my head and I almost declined their offer
46635,"Yea hopefully it doesn’t take them forever to choose one, cause they day they tell me they’ve decided on one is gonna be a cool day"
46636,Thank you!
46637,A lot of people probably think adoption shouldn’t be needed or wanted - but for me it’s reassurance of my role.
46638,"Normal people could probably just trust it without the legal side, for me it helps my trauma side of me"
46639,Strange when it's a bad argument that's somehow good in the end!
46640,Now you definitely can't argue the point!
46641,Lol
46642,"Yea that ones kinda a dead issue now.......lol 

Makes me feel dumb for even picking that fight with him now that I know him and Mom had been waiting to ask to adopt me"
46643,Pockets?!
46644,Say no more- that's the dress!
46645,What matters most is that this dress makes you feel like the most beautiful woman in the world.
46646,I think you look stunning.
46647,Congratulations!
46648,Sib that dress was made for you.
46649,The dress itself is stunning but you are absolutely GLOWING in it.
46650,"And tbh, i am SO jealous it has pockets!"
46651,Congrats on finding the perfect dress!
46652,You look beautiful.
46653,You can see by your smile how much you love the dress.
46654,Congrats!
46655,!
46656,You look gorgeous in that dress!
46657,Definitely that's the one.
46658,And POCKETS????
46659,Dang!
46660,Beautiful.
46661,That neckline suits you.
46662,Love how the rose lace applique echoes your tattoos.
46663,And it has pockets!
46664,Congrats on finding the one!
46665,Beautiful!
46666,And pockets!!
46667,!
46668,Stunning.
46669,Absolutely stunning.
46670,You have exquisite taste and look absolutely gorgeous.
46671,And everybody deserves pockets!
46672,"Congratulations, sweetheart."
46673,Have a wonderful ceremony and rest of your lives together.
46674,Pockets!!
46675,Say no more!
46676,"You look absolutely stunning, love, one can really see you feel beautiful."
46677,And look how the dress compliments your tattoos!
46678,All the best wishes on your upcoming marriage - you deserve all the happiness.
46679,Mum loves you.
46680,Be happy.
46681,❤️
46682,"as a sister, it looks amazing"
46683,You look beautiful and happy
46684,"The dress is beyond gorgeous, for all the reasons."
46685,"But you asked, so here are some mom considerations:

1."
46686,Can you breathe in it?
46687,All night?
46688,2.
46689,Will the bodice move or shift?
46690,Can you laugh/eat/dance without fear of popping a boob?
46691,3.
46692,"The train is gorgeous, but make sure you have a solution for it (like a snap, or a band around the wrist) if you plan on dancing with any sort of vigor—you don't want yourself or one of your guests to trip up in it or make you trip!"
46693,4.
46694,Can you undo it on your own?
46695,"If not, will there be someone to help you out of it at the end of the evening?"
46696,"(sometimes the partner will just get frustrated, and we don't want that!)"
46697,You look like a princess!
46698,"I’m so proud of you, and happy you’ve found a life partner."
46699,You are beautiful my sweet girl!
46700,"Fellow sibling here, since I too have no mother."
46701,GIRL THAT DRESS IS FLY AS HELL!!!!!
46702,I FREAKING LOVE IT!!!!
46703,"Dude just saying also, it hours fucking awesome with your tattoo and the way the bead work is, and trails AND HAS FUCKING POCKETS!!!!"
46704,get it girl.
46705,That's all you.
46706,You look like a metal princess.
46707,What a gorgeous dress!
46708,You have really fantastic taste.
46709,This looks beautiful on you and you can see from your face that you feel beautiful in it!
46710,Hi!
46711,"It's me, your big sister."
46712,I LOVE this dress on you and I can see how happy you look in it :) I got married last weekend and my dress had pockets too.
46713,They were awesome!
46714,"I kept mints, tissues, bobby pins and heart shaped sunglasses in there."
46715,During the ceremony I grabbed a tissue and people came up to me all night raving about the pockets!
46716,But the main thing is you look stunning and happy!
46717,You look stunning!
46718,"Pockets are always a big plus, the most important thing is that you love it."
46719,Big hugs!
46720,That looks beautiful on you!
46721,Look at your smile; it says it all.
46722,I would 100% tell you that's the dress just based on the pockets alone.
46723,But it really does look beautiful!
46724,"Congratulations, dear one!"
46725,Congratulations!!
46726,I'm so happy for you!
46727,1 - You look absolutely stunning!!
46728,2 - That dress is amazing and looks so gorgeous on you!!!
46729,3 - POCKETS??!!?!?!
46730,That's the best thing I've ever heard!
46731,4 - Your tattoos are perfection!
46732,You look beautiful but your smile says its the one for you.
46733,Enjoy your day!
46734,Absolutely perfect!
46735,You look lovely!
46736,It's stunning and you look like absolutely stunning!
46737,AND IT HAS POCKETS?
46738,I can't even get pants with proper pockets.
46739,"This is the one, if you feel as beautiful in it as I think you look."
46740,-younger sister
46741,You look amazing!
46742,Pockets are an awesome bonus!
46743,!
46744,Pockets!
46745,You could carry glitter or kittens or anything in that!
46746,"Oh yeah, that's THE dress"
46747,"Darling, you are beautiful and your dress is STUNNING!"
46748,"I hope everything about your special day, and the time leading up to it, is magical and everything you could wish for"
46749,You look like a princess!

47942,You have no idea what her mother has or hasn't done.
47943,She wasn't asking for opinions on her relationship with her mom.
47944,Just the dress.
47945,I am glad you've lived such a sheltered life that you think mothers can't be bad too.
47946,Edit : the above account seems to be a troll account so no more responses from me.
47947,she did.
47948,thanks!
47949,AND it looks this fabulous?!
47950,Winner!
47951,I love how the lace design is lovely yet subtle - not completely covering things just gorgeous all over.
47952,Just like OP's smile!
47953,Pockets or no - the one that makes you light up like that is the winner.
47954,Congratulations sweetie!
47955,What an absolutely stunning gown!
47956,You have a wonderful sense of style.
47957,"This looks great on you, and you can tell by the expression on your face that you love it!"
47958,"Yeah she said 2019 and she’s clearly not a teenager, so as an adult, she decided not to talk to her mother."
47959,Either way I’m in the shit.
47960,Well I’m not a mom but it’s a very nice wedding dress.
47961,We all make mistakes.
47962,Honestly I probably came across harsh because I have a horrible relationship with my family due to their addiction issues so I can definitely understand her potential pain.
47963,All we can do is the best we can with the information we have at the moment.
47964,I’m the opposite but my kids don’t talk to me (or their mom even though they live in the same house).
47965,"If there had been anything bad, I could understand but we’ve given them nothing but love and support."
47966,I guess I reacted without thinking it through and I’m sorry to all here for projecting.
47967,Not trying to attack you but is there a chance your children did try to tell but you didn't understand?
47968,I have a 13 year old and 8/10 if we have an issue it's because of miscommunication.
47969,"I highly recommend family therapy, given I know its not available to everyone."
47970,Edit:  also each person experiences life differently and it may seriously be just a misunderstanding or something you weren't even aware of doing.
47971,Different things feel bad to different people.
47972,The best thing I learned for my son and myself was to always be willing to admit that I could be wrong and how to say sorry.
47973,It is entirely possible.
47974,"It never occurred to me to question my parents, so may not have been ‘listening’ to my children."
47975,Exactly.
47976,I was taught to never question my elders and they never asked me what I thought so I didn't understand how talking was going to lead to anything other than yelling and violence.
47977,I had to work with a therapist and learn to really hear what my son was saying.
47978,My kiddo and I both express ourselves very differently.
47979,Also this sucks but sometimes you have to admit some of your decisions in the past were based off misunderstandings or just not being taught yourself how to handle these situations.
47980,We can hurt people unintentionally but that doesn't mean we don't owe them a hug and a sincere apology.
47981,I would never have guessed this was your first attempt; it's beautiful!
47982,Did you enjoy it?
47983,"I don't cross stitch often enough, but when I do I find it very relaxing (until my thread gets tangled, grrr...)."
47984,It looks great.
47985,You should post this on r/crossstitch they are a really supportive sub
47986,Well done sweetheart!
47987,"It's beautiful, and your stitches are very good."
47988,I'm so happy you tried something new!
47989,"Love, mom"
47990,That looks fantastic!
47991,You did such a fabulous job!
47992,It's beautiful.
47993,"I haven't touched it in years, but I learned as a child."
47994,My grandfather picked it up when he retired and did some beautiful pieces for his children.
47995,I think you'll be making big pieces soon!
47996,❤️
47997,"It’s beautiful, I love the colours you’ve combined to make the rose."
47998,"Did you  hobby, is it something you’ll carry on doing ?"

48169,Would you like to do another one or are you thinking about a new project?
48170,"If you'd like a couple of hints and tips for the next, I'm happy to share them - but they are just hints and tips because you have the most difficult bits down pat (like your tension and precision) and the fact that you're already at the 'perfecting' stage is so impressive (and I'm about 5% envious and 95% desperately proud!)"
48171,I hope you are planning to hang it up somewhere where it's in your eye-line to remind you of the new skills you've taught yourself so you feel proud when you see it?
48172,"I'm so impressed with you just for sticking with it, but it's an AMAZING first try - did you enjoy doing it?"

48180,I'm actually working on reorganizing my floss right now.

48183,"Put it in a place you will see all the time, like your dresser or living room."

48885,Gender fluid brother/sister here and I say to hell with passing.
48886,Just be who you want to be the way you want to be.
48887,I've spent way too long worrying about whether I look masculine enough (when I thought I was a boy) and all I got in return were a buttload of anxiety.
48888,It was only when I stopped caring about societal expectations that I found mental peace.
48889,And who says men cannot be feminine or girls can't be masc?
48890,These are all rules people who've been dead for over a millenium made and I say it's about time we change them!
48891,"If you do, know how."
48892,"Weight on the balls of your feet, not your toes or your heel, and move in a fluid movement to keep from pushing your heel into the dirt."
48893,"I was just trying it on to make sure I knew what I was gonna wear, It takes me forever to choose lol."
48894,I'm doing my makeup in some thing else :)
48895,Non-binary sibling here and I couldn't agree more!
48896,We all look most beautiful when we look as happy as our sister up there rocking that outfit!!!
48897,I hope you have so much fun with your friends!
48898,"To quote the meme: ""girls night, girls night, girls night!"""
48899,"Well, yeah."
48900,But I just love the quote and the acceptance behind it.
48901,"I’m impressed they can wear those heels, honestly."
48902,Same.
48903,I used to be great in heels but I’m getting too old now.
48904,"I’m not old enough to be considered a father to anyone who needs it, but I will absolutely be a brother for anyone who needs me."
48905,Raising my hand to be a part of this club.
48906,Plenty of love for all my long distance kiddos here.
48907,"I always stop to admire rainbows, don't you?"
48908,I'm a mum who needs a mum but alas my mum was an alcoholic abusive POS.
48909,Sometimes I wish I had someone to call for advice or whatever.
48910,"I'm disabled, single, two kids, little support system."
48911,Shit sucks.
48912,"Im the opposite of my mum and for that at least, I'm glad."
48913,"My kids don't even know what alcohol is, have never, and never will see me drunk"
48914,This is something my husband can’t understand when I grieve the relationship I wish I had with my mom.
48915,As much as his mom is the most amazing MIL a woman could ask for she’s not MY mom.
48916,"But, nonetheless, her support and care is appreciated."
48917,He will never understand not having his mother’s unconditional love and not having it is all I’ve ever known.
48918,Thank you.
48919,"My ""mother"" didn't accept me as bi, and barely wanted me, period."
48920,Thank you for being there for people like me.
48921,"I'm a mom to one, stepmother to three & lots more love to go around!"
48922,"Sending hugs to you all today, know there's someone here who loves you and is proud of you ❤ You (yes YOU) make my day better by just being here!"
48923,!
48924,Thank you so much <3
48925,I am old enough to be a mom but don’t have kids.
48926,I really love everyone who contributes here.
48927,I hope that I can encourage and support people in my small way here.
48928,I want all the hugs!
48929,This is really lovely.
48930,Thank you!

48936,I grew up basically without a mom or any parent.
48937,I wish I had a mom.

48943,Please forgive me mom .
48944,I am not the same anymore .
48945,I fucked up my life so bad .
48946,I did everything you you raised me not to do .
48947,All your limitless love was lost on me .
48948,I failed you mom .
48949,And for that I hate myself .
48950,I would like a hug.
48951,I'm a 15 year old gay teen with emotionally abusive parents.
48952,"I've had to deal with sexual assault, unrequited love, depression and anxiety (while struggling to maintain my 4.0 GPA to meet my parents' expectations) but I was brushed off and guilt-tripped by my parents, so I've kept everything to myself."
48953,"I really can't find a reason to live anymore, but I badly need a mom hug and reassurance that things will get better, even if it never will."
48954,I have the same sentiments!!
48955,"If anyone needs a mom, I'm here for love and support!"
48956,Happy pride and love who you are.
48957,"You are beautiful, strong, and just amazing!"
48958,My mother was great but I lost her years ago.
48959,Now that I've lost her (and am a big scary looking man) I don't receive many hugs nowadays.
48960,Could I have a hug?
48961,My little one is only 4 years old but he has taught me so much about what it is to be a mom.
48962,"I here, with open arms and an open mind, for anyone who needs it."
48963,"Love you all, you are not alone in this world."
48964,That's so sweet.
48965,Made me cry a bit.
48966,Thanks mom <3 I appreciate everyone here on the sub.
48967,You all are amazing.
48968,I'm doing ok I guess.
48969,Bowel issues and not sure where I'll move to.
48970,Smelly as usual...but I'm enjoying the small things in life again.
48971,I'll be ok I hope.
48972,Trauma anniversary is coming up but I'll be ok there too.
48973,I wish you and everyone here a good weekend.
48974,I’m a mother of two but in my 30’s so kind of middle ground.
48975,I’d be your mom but I’m also a good Auntie or Big Sister :) Whatever you need I’m there!
48976,When Im not in the throws of depression or stress.
48977,I do my best to take care of all those I love cause that's what I was given by them.

48979,"My wife and I waited years to adopt our daughter, so I’ve saved up plenty of mom hugs to share."
48980,I can’t bring myself to write a post.
48981,But a buried unread comment might help to vent.
48982,Today is my birthday.
48983,I never got to have one growing up.
48984,No candle covered cake or balloons.
48985,No gifts to open or flowers to show off.
48986,"I was a “bad kid” and “bad kids don’t get a birthday” if someone happens to see this…a mom, an aunt, a big sibling…I’m sorry…"
48987,Thank you.
48988,Your post/words almost made me cry.
48989,"If it weren't for the fact that I'm in a car with my husband and his brothers headed for a fun afternoon, I totally would have cried."
48990,"Since my mom died, my mom's hugs are one of the things I miss the most and cherish when other special moms give to me."
48991,Mom hugs are truly special.
48992,It would be nice
48993,Our love has never been expressed more beautifully by any of us “moms.”  Thank you.
48994,🥰💗☮️
48995,"I lost my mom almost a month ago and all her girlfriends, most of whom I hadn't met, became my new moms immediately."
48996,I've been visiting them as often as I can but couldn't make it this weekend and it's been rough without their support.
48997,A mother's love truly is special and my heart goes out to all those who didn't get to experience it for whatever reason 💖
48998,Hey mum.
48999,I’ve had a lot going on recently and I’ve kind of just been avoiding everything while having it in the back of my mind.
49000,"I’m thinking tomorrow I’ll try get up early, do all the stuff I’ve been putting off then spend the rest of the day (or Monday depending how long I take) as a break."
49001,You think it’s a good idea?
49002,I don’t really think I can since every time I’ve tried this in the past something’s come up and I feel disappointed in myself.
49003,It would just be nice to get some encouragement to do the small things.
49004,Your proudly bisexual mama is here to affirm you!
49005,You can have a hug or a fist bump and tell me all about your unique self.
49006,"We are diverse animals, we humans and all the ways it comes out in the wash are just fine!"
49007,"And if the family you grew up with isn't on the same page, you will find a new one."
49008,I did and I'm so happy!
49009,There is hope.
49010,Thank you for the Mom energy!!
49011,Everyday at some point I feel my brain looking for the Mom I never had.
49012,It is some kind of trauma that keeps coming back.
49013,It felt good to c I am not the only one and there are supportive people out there.
49014,"Thank you

It means a lot

There are no words to really describe how nice/happy/loved this makes me feel (and most definitely others)

  


Thank you from the bottom of my heart

I wish all moms were as lovely as you all"
49015,I’m a mom of two.
49016,A mom who’s stopped trying to label who I love and am attracted to.

49433,Beautiful dress and little girl.
49434,Kudos for keeping her off SM.

49436,What a beautiful job!
49437,She is absolutely precious!
49438,"So fucking adorable, good job Sis!"

49451,The dress is beautiful.
49452,Well done!
49453,!
49454,Gorgeous dress and definitely a good idea to keep her face off social media for safety.
49455,"Great job, sis!!"
49456,!
49457,"Great job, sweetheart!"
49458,Someday your baby girl will look back at these pictures and be reminded of how talented her mama is.

49460,Please tell me you kept it for the memories!
49461,>.<>.<>.<

49466,I was waiting to see the end result!!
49467,Slay!
49468,You did a really good job.
49469,She’s actually clapping her heart out at the entrance at all the other beautiful women in beautiful gowns.
49470,The second picture is her going around the dance floor in circles 🥹 the venue photographer was chasing her trying to catch a glimpse and she’d giggle and walk away from him whenever he pointed the camera at her.
49471,The picture (and dress) is so prefect I literally thought this was a still from an animated movie too!
49472,This is such a beautiful way to put it.
49473,"You’re so right, it does look like that."
49474,Thank you ❤️❤️
49475,Literally my first thought.
49476,I was trying to figure out what movie it was from then I read the caption
49477,Thank you so much 🌸🥰
49478,Thank you so much.
49479,My ig is set to private to family and friends only and I’m anxious about SM safety and how it gives a false sense of security.
49480,You’re making me feel secure in my decision.
49481,💓
49482,I’m so thankful.
49483,It really makes me feel motivated to create more for her.

49551,"A part of me feels like I am not meant to be alive anymore

I know your experience is complex and I'm not trying to downplay that, but I *do* want to roll in and put some sis energy on this:

You came in like an absolute fucking *badass* and gave death and god the middle finger."

49677,A big happy birthday to you!
49678,Hahaha!
49679,That idea is not really feasible right now (both because I am really shy and only get paid at the end of the week) but picturing it really made me chuckle (and then melt into my desk because I couldn’t stand a whole restaurant of strangers sing!).
49680,Thank you for that
49681,This is exactly it!
49682,"There’s so many people who can’t even get medical care in the first place, and so many people who fight and are still gone."
49683,And I have all the chances and… do nothing with it but sitting in my apartment.
49684,It *does* make one feel guilty sometimes.
49685,I hope you are doing better these days and are healthy and protected  as well
49686,Dads and Moms are just different labels for the same concept.
49687,"Thank you, I will check the sub out and maybe one day I’ll sit down and write the whole clusterfuck into a comprehensive post when I have the leftover energy to sort it all out."

49717,Chill in your apartment and soak up the amazing opportunity to happily do nothing!
49718,I mean...

49762,"Be prepared for her to be very, very tired and probably nauseous for much of the first trimester."
49763,"I expected the nausea, but didn’t realize it also meant that so many foods and smells would make me sick."
49764,I also didn’t realize I would have enough energy to barely function most days!
49765,"Every pregnancy is different, but my husband has done a great job of picking up the slack when I come home from work and don’t have enough energy to even pull myself off the couch to eat."
49766,His compassion and help has been wonderful and means so much to me.
49767,Congratulations!

49850,"I later found out I could but would be extremely high risk, I'm saying this to explain why I'm giving the advice I'm about to give."
49851,"Implantation hurts,  I was so very frightened with my eldest given the high risk & a previous loss... Thankfully my sister was a mother of two & calmed me down."
49852,"I still spoke to my midwife, but just think it's something women are rarely told & should know."
49853,Knowing with my second I told him to burrow in nice & snug...
49854,It doesn't last long.
49855,"On the awesome things you'll soon experience baby's heartbeat, I was unaware I'd hear it so soon, my husband couldn't make the appointment so my sister took me."
49856,We were both crying & I recorded it on my phone.
49857,"That son is 15 now, so wasn't best sound quality but enough to make my hubby tear up."
49858,I listen to that sound so many times between appointments.
49859,Again congratulations!
49860,That line makes you both look awfully pregnant!
49861,Congrats!
49862,I thought IUI’s working was a myth.
49863,So glad they worked for you!
49864,We did 6!
49865,(But we finally got our babies!)
49866,I teared up!
49867,Congrats!
49868,Congratulations on your wife's pregnancy.
49869,Congratulations!!
49870,!
49871,Omg congrats!
49872,My husband and I were also successful with our first round of IUI and now have 3 month old twins!
49873,!
49874,I for sure see three lines!
49875,Congratulations!
49876,"You are, indeed!!"
49877,Congratulations!!
49878,!
49879,That's wonderful news!
49880,Congratulations!
49881,❤️
49882,Congratulations!
49883,We had our first IUI procedure at the beginning of the month and our positive test on 10/17 so we’re going through this with ya!
49884,Congratulations
49885,"Oh yeah, those are some positive tests!!"
49886,CONGRATULATIONS!
49887,!
49888,"Congratulations, that is so exciting."
49889,:)
49890,Mazel tov!
49891,May the pregnancy be easy and healthy for both mother and child.
49892,"Omg, OMG, I'm flapping my hands like a weirdo and my foster kitties are attacking and I'm so excited for you!"
49893,"Hugs, hugs, hugs!"
49894,Congratulations!
49895,So happy for you both!
49896,Sending sticky thoughts your way!!!
49897,!
49898,Oh wow!
49899,Amazing news!
49900,Congratulations to you both!
49901,I used one of those Clear Blue tests when I thought I might be pregnant.
49902,There was an insanely strong vertical line and a visible but greyed horizontal line - took us several minutes of staring at the instructions to work out that the vertical line was the important one and my husband joked I was super pregnant and having triplets (which got a lot less funny at our first scan when we found out it was twins).
49903,Congratulations!!!
49904,I'm snuggling my little IUI Babe as I type this.
49905,You are going to be fantastic parents!
49906,A big fat yep!
49907,!
49908,those are very positive tests!!!!
49909,i am so so proud of you!
49910,you and your wife are going to be amazing parents.
49911,i’m so excited for your journey 💛
49912,Gahhhh!!
49913,Sooo exciting!!
49914,Congratulations to you two and best of luck on the next 18+ years of the BEST rollercoaster ride EVERRRRR!!
49915,🖤
49916,Congratulations!
49917,Congratulations !!!!
49918,!
49919,Yay!
49920,Congrats 🎉
49921,Earth has enough people already
49922,"Thank you, we're excited and nervous at this point to be honest!"
49923,When I was pregnant there was a lesbian couple that got pregnant around the same time.
49924,I think their pregnancies were like a month apart.
49925,They posted on /r/babybumps often
49926,This is so cute lol
49927,"My dad worked with a woman who was trying to get pregnant, and eventually her and her wife decided to switch and see if they had more luck."
49928,"There ended up being some overlap and suddenly both of them were pregnant, and one had twins."
49929,"Not OP, just a person having a real sh!tty day in a really sh!tty year... and the image of two angry preggie ladies colliding like those people who run at balance balls and bouncing away put a much needed smile on my face."
49930,So thanks for that!
49931,"Your reminding me of a meme that went like 

When two pregnant people start fighting it's like the babies are having a mecha fight"
49932,This sounds like a funny AF children's book.
49933,🤣
49934,Thanks for the advice!
49935,"It does get hot here, we're in the PNW so it's not as bad as where you are, but the last couple of summers have been VERY hot."
49936,I'll remember this!
49937,I can absolutely relate to this comment!!
49938,"Both of mine were conceived end of October, and holy moly Roly poly were those summers hot and miserable!!!"
49939,😭🤣 Cold and frozen treats will be a must OP!
49940,!
49941,"Thanks for confirming what you see too, of course we will be going for a confirmatory blood test tomorrow, but I think they're all faint positives!"
49942,Congratulations!
49943,"Yes, I (we) are as ready as we can be for how she’s feeling."
49944,"So far, the exhaustion checks out."
49945,She’s been extra tired the last couple of weeks.
49946,I’m trying to encourage her to listen to her body and rest when she’s tired.
49947,"Thank you for the advice, and I hope your journey goes smoothly."
49948,"Thanks, haha, I hope for the same!"
49949,"Well it’s technically our fourth try as a couple, but first IUI at the clinic."
49950,[removed]
49951,Ha!
49952,"We took one yesterday afternoon and saw the faint line, but didn't want to get too excited so we waited until this morning, when the doctor originally suggested we try."
49953,Two more faint lines = 3 total faint lines...
49954,I think we can believe it!
49955,"No such thing as being a little pregnant, learned that from this sub!"
49956,Thank you!
49957,We're so excited!
49958,"Getting nervous, but excited."
49959,"We are so happy too, thanks for sharing that joy!"
49960,!
49961,Thanks so much :)
49962,Where do you get off saying such a thing here?
49963,Best indicator that you’ll be great parents!
49964,Would be wrong not to be a little nervous too!
49965,Now you have months and months ahead of you that you can spend to get on the same page in all the little details.
49966,"If you need a nice book to start conversations get a copy of Philipps Perry‘s „the Book you wish your parents had read“, we got a lot of great convos going with it!"
49967,BROO having one newborn and giving birth was so hard I can’t imagine planning twins and two partners recovering from birth some people are just built different I’m soft as counter butter
49968,I just realized it sort of turned out that way that we're boinking around.
49969,That 1 singular pregnancy turned into a big ole snuggle monster who's neurodivergency manifests in interesting ways one of which is sleeping in between his moms for his entire life (please be a joke please be a joke).
49970,We have a large bed but he's a large 6 year old human.
49971,I used to ask my wife to pull my arm to help me roll over and now she has to ask me to pull the overgrown prairie dog out from under her flank.
49972,"LOL we're not even trying yet and my husband turns pale when he hears stories about surprise triplets and people who had 1, wanted a second and then had twins or triplets."
49973,I think he thinks 2 is enough 😂
49974,Oh my god that's frankly terrifying.
49975,At that point you need to open up the relationship and find a unicorn willing to help you both lol
49976,"Hey, i hope you get better soon."
49977,I’m here if you need to vent.
49978,"(I don’t mean to be creepy, that’s how my comment sounds lol!)"
49979,That sounds badass.
49980,"In reality it's more like when the oompa loompas are rolling violet beauregard's giant blueberry ass to the ""pressing room""."
49981,Winter is a great time to get your summer AC situation figured out
49982,You're very welcome!
49983,I bought an inflatable pool and sat in it all summer when I was pregnant during a PNW summer.
49984,Ooh yes.
49985,"My first pregnancy was in Portland, and I was due in mid-July during what was then the hottest summer on record."
49986,"If you don’t have AC (like lots of Cascadia folk), plan to buy a little unit, or set a tray of ice in front of a box fan like my Oklahoma grandmother did."
49987,"That saved me, those last couple weeks of pregnancy when I could barely move or breathe in the oppressive heat."
49988,My mom always likes to complain that I was born in November in Florida.
49989,But she forgets my daughter was born in early September in Florida.
49990,I don't wish that level of sweat on anyone lol.
49991,"I have an late October, late July and early September so I've spent three summers being miserably hot and uncomfortable."
49992,Shaved Ice is a life and sanity saver as are pools.
49993,No doubt about it.
49994,"Any line, no matter how faint, is a positive."
49995,Just like a COVID test but way better!
49996,!
49997,My (now) 3 year old was as faint as your first test!
49998,hahaha
49999,I might have thought the top one was indent.
50000,The one under it is definitely pink though!
50001,Congratulations:)
50002,how many days after IUI did it turn positive
50003,Thank you and same to you all!
50004,Big big date night!
50005,"Do all the things you both love, get all the food and the snacks and the whatevers!"
50006,<3
50007,"If you already have a room picked out for the baby and haven't set it up yet, maybe clean the room up/out and display one of her art pieces in the room."
50008,I would find that really touching if my partner did that if I were in her place.
50009,"Those last two aren’t faint, they’re clear as day."
50010,Congratulations!!!
50011,!
50012,If you're counter butter then I'm butter flavored oil bc I'm too soft to do it even once
50013,Ikr?
50014,Sounds waaaaaayyyyyy too hard for me!
50015,Thank you.
50016,"It's just been sh!t after sh!t and now our beloved pupper seems to have gone partially blind near overnight, looks like he's been developing diabetes- I just want to sit down and give up, so the smile was very appreciated!"
50017,Two weeks!
50018,"That sounds great, we're experts in those kinds of nights!"
50019,;)
50020,"Well, the baby's room will also be my wife's art studio since that is what our 2nd bedroom is used for."
50021,"So a lot of her art is already displayed there, which I love!"
50022,We have been planning/talking about this for quite sometime.
50023,"We're so excited, the intention has been there for 2 years and now it's become a reality!"
50024,"Awesome, glad to hear you agree!!"
50025,Thanks!
50026,!
50027,Aww.. i’m sorry.. give the pup a cuddle for me.
50028,Keep strong!
50029,"Hell yes, sib!"
50030,These kinds of posts legit make me start to tear up.
50031,"Congratulations, and may you be eternal couch buddies, may you always share your food (even if it’s *ril* good food), may you forever bicker over what to watch, may you always have plenty of blankets for when one is cold and the other is hot, may you always laugh like idiots over things only the two of you will ever think is funny while the rest of us think you’re insane, and may you be the very best of friends forever."
50032,"Please update when you tie the knot, and again, congratulations."
50033,💜
50034,"Oh honey, you've given me the best Christmas!"

50288,I straight-up have a massive fan pointed right at me at all times!
50289,(Who knew you could get hot flashes at 32?!

50298,😀🤣
50299,"Lol, you just have to get the head turn *just right* so they think you think they didn’t see you seeing them, but you saw that they saw you see them see you seeing them."
50300,Exactly!
50301,Hi sweets.
50302,What amazing work!
50303,Your tattooist is an incredible artist.
50304,"And not all art is pleasing to everyone so if it pleases you, I'm just thrilled for you."
50305,Power and delight instead of reminders of violence and victimization.
50306,You're so strong!
50307,"Hey Love, as your mother, I have to apologize."
50308,I am so sorry.
50309,"I understand now, that it doesn't matter that I wish you didn't have any 'marks' on you, because in fact, you had them before."
50310,I didn't understand what these scars meant to you and how much Power you would be able to take back in this way!
50311,I am so sorry I said I did not like it.
50312,I am proud of you and I hope it brings you joy every time you look at it from now on!

50349,May you never have to think about him again.
50350,I have an enormous piece wrapped around my right thigh.
50351,"Before I got that piece, I had an enormous burn scar wrapped around my right thigh."

50364,This is a wonderful thing.
50365,I'm hoping to do just the same thing in a year or so.
50366,I have a spot I hate seeing so I'm working on ideas to cover it with a tattoo.
50367,"I literally have the same thought, I want to change what I see so it will be something I love now."
50368,I think it is a powerful step and am so proud of you.
50369,Tattoos are for you and things you love.
50370,"My response whenever people have told me they don't like my tattoos has been ""guess it's a good thing I didn't get it for you."""

50439,"nice choice, great artist whoever did it."
50440,like it's hella detailed and well done.
50441,"your mom probably just doesn't appreciate tattoos, but it's a work of art and don't let her sour opinion upset you."
50442,especially the fact the tattoo has genuine meaning to you makes it even better.
50443,"Hi sweetheart, it's absolutely beautiful."
50444,Now you can look at your arm and love it again by the memories you'll make showing like minded people the beautiful artwork your arm has now.
50445,This looks fantastic sis!
50446,Taking back your own autonomy is always a triumph and the design is awesome.

50482,Good for you sweetie!
50483,A lot of people don't like tattoos; I think what most of them don't understand is that our tattoos tell a part of our story.
50484,You tattoo is stunning.
50485,Wear it with pride - you are stronger than your past.
50486,I think the tattoo artist did a great job

50494,"This is beautiful, and if it helps you to continue to heal, it’s even more amazing!!!"
50495,"There’s no way to explain to people who don’t want to understand what you’ve been through, so you have to do what’s right for you."
50496,"My oldest daughter was in a catastrophic car accident with multiple major injuries, one was a brain injury with memory loss."
50497,"She tattooed an entire arm with her (our) pet’s faces, opposite forearm had her siblings names."
50498,"It was therapeutic for her, and a way for her to feel like she wouldn’t forget."
50499,"You did something to move forward from a bad relationship, there are many who struggle with that."
50500,Be proud of your strength and don’t ever forget how determined you are to create a new path for yourself.

50513,I'm so thankful that the experience of that jackass is behind you and this design marks the beauty and strength of your future!
50514,Beautiful application of wabi sabi.
50515,❤️ All the strength to you dear.
50516,"It's a beautiful work of art, remember sometimes mom's miss the mark."
50517,It's not because of you or the art at all.
50518,Rather my ignorance on art forms and what this means to you.
50519,"If you can forgive my misses, and focus on my tries, as the misses only speak poorly about myself."
50520,"You my dear are loved, happy healing, you deserved this moment so relish in it."
50521,"Remember, you are always valid, you're allowed to be or present as you are, no matter what you have value."
50522,How you feel about about the art is what matters the most.

50530,It’s like a rebirth.
50531,It’s beautiful.
50532,"It will age beautifully and I’m happy for you, love."
50533,One day ima get my self harm scars covered when I can afford it.
50534,Change how I feel when I look at them
50535,What a powerful and beautiful way to reclaim your body.
50536,"I love this and I’m so proud of you for surviving what you went through and being here, and strong, today."
50537,That is a lovely tribute to your arm.
50538,":) I did something similar to my pointer finger on my right hand, I always thought it looked ugly and rough because it had gotten damaged so often, through accidents and self harm but I am grateful that it helps me make art and do difficult tasks, so I got a simple ring for it."
50539,Amazing!
50540,Who is the artist?
50541,hell yes that's awesome!
50542,I’ve been saving to cover the 3rd degree burn scars in my arms from my abuser .
50543,I can’t even imagine how much of a weight must be off your shoulders to not have to look at a daily reminder anymore.
50544,It’s been ten years and I still hide my arms in shame
50545,Congratulations on a beautiful piece of art that will remind you everyday that you’re beautiful and worthwhile.
50546,"Being able to see something that doesn’t bring bad memories is a new page in the book of you, a page that starts with the sentence, she knew she was worth more than the twat had made her believe and so she screamed her worth to the world."

50579,It’s fantastic work.
50580,I’m proud of you for getting out and getting something that makes you feel complete and happy.
50581,"If I’m interpreting this correctly, I see that this is Medusa and she is widely symbolized for in her tale she stands up against SA and those of us wear her as a badge of honor (of sorts) as we are now freed from our abusers."
50582,"I mention the above because if that is true, I also want to say (again) that I’m proud of you for getting out and becoming the strong person you are today."
50583,"I’m not sure if you’re from the US, but with all that has been going on, we need to stick together and your tattoo honestly gives me more inspiration and motivation to stand up against the transgressions that are happening."

50595,I absolutely adore it.
50596,It’s powerful.
50597,I did that to my left arm.
50598,I had a self harm wound that went too deep and had 12 internal and 18 external stitches.
50599,Bothered me forever and gave me a lot of shame.
50600,Last year I tattooed the friends couch and “I’ll be here for you” as my commitment to help my friends in need that may be emotionally struggling cause I felt I had healed from the self harm stage of my life.
50601,I love your tattoo.
50602,I’m not a mom.
50603,Just some guy.

50611,Proud of you being pure hearted and emotional.
50612,Keep smiling always.
50613,"I love it without even considering the story, but even more so knowing that you took something bad and found a way to reclaim it, make it your own again, and love it again."
50614,I’m so proud of you!
50615,A stunning masterpiece just like you.

50619,Thank you
50620,Aquaphor worked on mine!
50621,So luxurious.
50622,Thank you for sharing your story.
50623,I feel like this is so much nicer seeing this than the bruises or scars caused by what happened.
50624,It feels so good
50625,Ok fuck off then
50626,"Yep, that’s what I am using!"
50627,(Just got my tatt done also)
50628,">It feels so good

And that is the ONLY thing that matters."
50629,My apologies...
50630,I thought this was a tattoo sub reddit.
50631,"It's not and I didn't realize, let me know if you want me to delete comment."
50632,It’s great!
50633,"Plus sunscreen, always and forever."
50634,"We spent good money on this art, gotta keep it nice!"
50635,Why would commenting this on a tattoo subreddit make you sound less of an asshole?
50636,Do you think it makes you sound better to be an asshole in a tattoo subreddit?
50637,Lmao ridiculous.
50638,Best of luck being a shitty person.
50639,"Because when you post on a tattoo subreddit they ask you for your opinion, as in, what do think?"
50640,This one is more of a mom affirmation subreddit and i didn't realize.
50641,Lol yeah cause on a normal tattoo subreddit you don't post expecting implicit affirmation.
50642,It's actually more of a what do you think?
50643,Lol no.
50644,Asking for your opinion is not an opportunity for you to just assert that it looks bad without any genuine feedback or critique.
50645,Nobody but you shits a single fuck if something goes against your particular tastes
50646,Sorry you commented here instead of a place where you felt safer being a dick then.
50647,?
50648,"This mom ""finds your presentation"" EPIC."
50649,That skirt is fire.
50650,The composition of the whole outfit is on point.
50651,"You are amazing, that outfit is amazing, don't let haters hold you back."
50652,"Honestly, if you would be willing to hear some advice, don't engage."
50653,It isn't worth it.
50654,"Be yourself, keep rocking you, and don't let anybody distract you from who you are, not even for a second."
50655,LOVE the make up.
50656,Happy Pride!
50657,You look amazing and you have every right to rock in your own skin.
50658,Thank you all so much for the support and beautiful comments!
50659,Genuinely started to tear up at some.
50660,"For clarification, my mom types sloppily through text all the time."
50661,English isn't her first language but despite being highly educated she types like this i guess because she was just thought dumping or something?
50662,It gets worse when she switches between languages mid sentence and she won't even accent her words.
50663,"We are an Eastern European family, so big on caring about what other people think, stoicism, high expectations, etc."
50664,"When her mother came to visit I was given a whole speech about how I need to keep my gender and drag stuff to myself, how she won't understand, she made it sound like I'd give her a heart attack and when I said as much she said I might."
50665,"She asked what I plan on doing with the rest of my family and she got really concerned when I said ""transition"" while explaining that I planned on just showing up one day transitioned and not say anything."
50666,"Though in reality I really want to just never see anyone again 

It just feels so awful finally figuring out who you are, especially after years of dissociating, only to be told that I need to be hidden."
50667,Happy pride from your bisexual sister!
50668,You look amazing honey!
50669,Hey!
50670,"That is some amazing eyeshadow, damn."
50671,I wanted to say that it seems like your mom and mine share a similar mindset.
50672,My sister recommended the book ‘Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents’ and it has really helped me find peace and a position of disengaged understanding when it comes to why she says what she says.
50673,Maybe it’ll help you too?
50674,I got so distracted by your amazing PRIDE SPORRAN that I lost all my thoughts.
50675,It's so cool!
50676,"And I'm so proud of you for figuring out who you are and starting your transition, that's wonderful!"
50677,Also can you get some distance from your mom?
50678,"Is that something you can afford to do, whether by going low contact or stopping contact entirely?"
50679,"Because you sound amazing, and dang am I impressed by your epic rainbow coord, and there's no need to devote your energy to someone who doesn't see how awesome you are."
50680,You shouldn't have to hide your light so that she can feel comfortable in her world view.
50681,"The make up, the hair, the cute outfit, the boots!"
50682,Love love love it!
50683,I snorted at “Even blind chicken sometimes finds a kernel.”
50684,Happy pride!
50685,You look wonderful.
50686,I *think* that your parents are expressing concern for your mental health and the use of hormones.
50687,"I don’t know enough about either of these (your mental health or use or hormones) to comment, but I would encourage you to stand confident in your identity and in spending time with others who validate and accept and celebrate your true self."
50688,"If that’s not you parents right now, calmly bow out."
50689,You deserve to be celebrated!
50690,"As always, take care of yourself honey!"
50691,You look amazing and happy and that eye makeup is to die for I'm so jealous.
50692,Fly that flag high and strong and be who you are inside and out.
50693,Life is too short to live it for others while it harms you.
50694,From a mamma from across the pond 💞💕🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
50695,Did you take some inspiration from Bowie?
50696,You are gorgeous.
50697,This is stylish and beautiful from head to toe as are you.
50698,Happy pride.
50699,Transmale Sibling here!
50700,I am proud of you for sticking up for yourself.
50701,"That is the biggest take away I see - you are couragious enough, bold enough, confident enough to show the world (even those who won't listen) who you are inside and out."
50702,"That is what inspires me about you; it is hard to do those things, but here you are, doing it anyways."
50703,I love that and I am so happy that we can be out here celebrating together!!
50704,Surround yourself with those who see you and *want* to see you.
50705,You are worth it.
50706,You deserve it.
50707,"I am the mom to a Transwoman and so I can understand where your mom is coming from, but I also see how she is so completely wrong."
50708,She's blaming your depression for causing your issues and taking hormones as a thing that will just add fuel to the fire.
50709,She doesn't seem to understand that the depression is just one of the many severe side effects of living the wrong life.
50710,"The hormones are going to cause mood swings, sure, but that's a temporary side effect that will balance out and the end result is so much better."
50711,You are amazing and wonderful.
50712,Surround yourself with positive people.
50713,You deserve to be happy.
50714,What a cool shirt!
50715,And I LOVE the David Bowie style make-up!
50716,Super cool!
50717,You look fierce!
50718,Love this mummabear xx
50719,Wow I love your outfit!
50720,"You look so beautiful, happy, and proud."
50721,Just because  your mom can't  see the beautiful person you are doesn't mean it's not there.
50722,Her being mean is about her and 💯 not about you and who you are.
50723,I'm so happy you got to have the gender euphoria  you deserve.
50724,Big hugs.
50725,Don’t you look amazing!!
50726,I am very proud of you for finding your voice and standing up for yourself.
50727,That takes such strength.
50728,Keep being you!
50729,"You are strong, smart, and beautiful!"
50730,Happy Pride month.
50731,I am a healthcare worker and some of the patients I see are either young adults trying to figure out their gender or people who’s gender is different from their biological sex.
50732,"(I hope that was worded ok, I try my best to be an Ali) I just want to say if you want to do hormones it is very safe with a doctors guidance."
50733,I don’t want to assume you are on hormones but just wanted to say I’ve never heard of loosing your hair because of hormones.
50734,(But I’m not a doctor).
50735,I see a lot of patients for different things and hormones is one of them.
50736,I’ve not seen anyone ever complain of loosing hair from hormones.
50737,Take care you look lovely.
50738,I love your makeup.
50739,"Happy Pride, honey."
50740,You look cute as hell.
50741,"Sorry that is the ""support"" your parents are offering."
50742,"🙃

I'm glad you came here, and I hope you're feeling the love."
50743,💓
50744,Happy pride from your trans sister!
50745,You look amazing and I’m so proud of you for standing up to your mom like that.
50746,I’m inspired by your example.
50747,You know what?
50748,I support you.
50749,I think you look great.
50750,"Proud of you for the incredible look, wonderful experience at pride AND reading your Mom to filth without compromising yourself."
50751,Keep.
50752,It.
50753,Up!
50754,!
50755,This Mum thinks you look super cute and you're an artist with that eye design.
50756,"Big hugs to you sweetheart, happy Pride month."
50757,"Love your look dear, you look so pretty!"
50758,I am so proud of you!!
50759,Go have fun!
50760,Weird Aunt: *envies your outfit*
50761,Happy pride sweetheart!
50762,You look stunning!
50763,I love that top so very much!
50764,Very proud of you for standing your ground and love that going to the pride event gave you so much happiness!
50765,Keep the positive in your life!
50766,The people who accept you and understand you!
50767,Love yourself because you are a wonderful human being!
50768,Reddit momma loves you!
50769,You are a fucking feeling and i love it!
50770,You look perfect for a pride parade and those boots make your legs look amazing.
50771,You’re beautiful… your mom is blind…Happy Pride hun… you look amazing and will meet amazing people…Some parents will never understand that you were born to be different.
50772,Hope things get better and you have a great support system
50773,That is quite the pride filled outfit and it looks good on you
50774,Hey kid!
50775,You look great!
50776,And you look HAPPY.
50777,"Live your best life, know that we are proud of you!!"
50778,Always ALWAYS ALLLLLWAYS  remember that any of the lgbtqa+ call lines are available!
50779,And we are always here too!
50780,"Beautiful soul, happy Pride."
50781,"I am a mother, and I love you just the way you are."
50782,"Showing who you are and not caring what anyone thinks is a testament to how absolutely powerful you are, let that help you stand tall above the superficial bs the world tosses you my beautiful child."
50783,"If she wants you to block photos on social media, go ahead and block HER on social media."
50784,"Anyone who ""wants to speak their mind"" but doesn't want a conversation after the fall out of what they put out into the world is a narcissist, and you don't deserve that."
50785,"""Even a blind chicken gets a kernel"" Seriously, what a great sense of humor."
50786,You look fabulous.
50787,"I would suggest (cause Mom's got to) is next time you wear that outfit, we should get you some rainbow shoe laces to match the skirt."
50788,"&#x200B;

Oh and Happy Pride!"
50789,You look AMAZING.
50790,Like I’d want to be your friend if I saw you out and about or at a pride parade!!!
50791,I’m probably not old enough to be your mom but man do I have the love for it.
50792,"Sadly, a lot of people believe what the far right is saying about trans people."
50793,But it’s affecting real people.
50794,"Trust me, no one dressed that well can be “unwell” lmao."
50795,"I hope you have trusted friends and perhaps a therapist, cause this world is hard and when you’re going through any changes, or strife from loved ones, like, my therapist has been amazing."
50796,I understand it’s not possible for everyone to find or afford one tho.
50797,Happy pride from your enby sib!
50798,You’re killing it!
50799,"Most men transition into women, it looks like you transitioned into a rainbow"
50800,"You handled that ***BEAUTIFULLY*** ❤ you look healthy, happy, strong....you look amazing!!"
50801,"I'm sorry your parents can't see the incredible person standing right in front of them, shame on them and their loss."
50802,They don't get to enjoy all the love and light you bring into this world or ride along with you while you find what brings about all of your infections joy and happiness.
50803,Fuck em!
50804,You're doing amazing sweety 😘😄
50805,You look fierce!
50806,"Love, love, love the make-up!"
50807,Keep rockin’ it!
50808,Well you look fucking great.
50809,This Mom says you are rocking the Pride look.
50810,Your outfit is super cute and your makeup is amazing.
50811,"It does sound like your Mom is worried, but might be drawing conclusions based on misinformation."
50812,I honestly don't know if she's being rational or not.
50813,She may be misguided.
50814,She also may be uncomfortable with you presenting yourself due to her insecurity.
50815,My mother has in the past said similar things and she was projecting a lot.
50816,"You look amazing, honey!"
50817,I love your outfit and makeup!
50818,It's so nice that you are starting to understand yourself and become the person you always wanted to be.
50819,"I'm glad we live at a time where this is possible and you can feel happy and confident :) 


Try not to let the words of your biological parents get to you, it seems like they don't want to understand how you feel."
50820,Especially the nagging and attempts at ruining your confidence.
50821,"You are great the way you are, I hope you will always feel loved, confident and happy like you did at pride <3"
50822,Oh my goodness you look amazing!!
50823,"😍 
You know yourself better than anyone else, they may not fully understand but hopefully in time, that will change."
50824,"Either way, I can be your Mom in the meantime."
50825,I'm so proud of how your are expressing yourself.
50826,You are amazing!
50827,!
50828,I love your outfit and your pizzazz!
50829,I also respect the calm sensible things you laid out in your response to your parent.
50830,Geez - your sentence structure alone lets me know that you are a thoughtful individual and I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself without being outright mean.
50831,I wish you the best with all your choices.
50832,Transitions can be tough in many ways but you seem open to the challenge and again - FABulous style!
50833,Rock on sweetie!
50834,First of sweetheart you look amazing.
50835,"Second, you know you better than anyone, and it’s our job to love *you*."
50836,"Not our idea of you, *you* and let me tell you."
50837,"You are worth love, and the courage it took to get you here is incredible."
50838,"T is not some body ruining drug, it’s a life assisting tool and you know how to use it, you’ve done your research and you are building the you that you want to see in the world."
50839,I’m so proud of you and so excited that you’re set on this journey!
50840,r/Trans is always a good place for support and you can always reach out to me as well <3
50841,"From someone who's not in the environment being very cis/straight/boring type-of-woman (😉) - and also a mother, let me tell you this; YOU LOOK AMAZING."
50842,"This will maybe insult some straight person out there who is looking to find something to be insulted about, but I've somehow always thought that gay people tend to look much happier than straight people."
50843,You're positively beaming.
50844,I'm loving the rainbow look!
50845,Don't ever let anyone dull your shine.
50846,❤️❤️❤️
50847,Happy Pride!
50848,Your look was fire and I'm so proud of you!
50849,You look fabulous.
50850,You hold your head high and know that everyone here is proud of you.
50851,Your photo made me smile.
50852,You look absolutely awesome.
50853,You're glowing.
50854,I have a ten year old son.
50855,If he sent me that photo in ten years time I'd be proud that my child was so strong in their identity and had a much better sense of style than their mom!
50856,"wow, you're gorgeous."
50857,"Your mom sounds like she's on the fast track to a guardianship, though."
50858,She COULD have alzheimer's.
50859,Edit: I just read the messages more carefully.
50860,I don't think your mom has Alzheimer's.
50861,She is sincerely worried about you and she needs to GET OVER HER INTERNALIZED MISOGYNY!!!
50862,"Please, you can let her know, I'm transmasc just like you and I do NOT use T, because I prefer to be a visibly successful AFAB person who doesn't need drugs in order to be taken seriously."
50863,PM me if you ever want to chat.
50864,It sounds like we have a LOT in common.
50865,"OMG, I knew a young man transitioning when I went back to college, He was my oldest child after the crap they pulled on him."
50866,Hey sib you look AMAZING
50867,Happy pride sweetheart.
50868,That outfit is adorable and it looks great on you!
50869,Happy pride!!
50870,You look stunning!
50871,You are stunning!
50872,Your outfit is amazing but most of all your kindness shines through your eyes.
50873,Live your best life and know that your auntie loves you.
50874,"Sweets, you look incredible!!"
50875,All of your internet moms say so.
50876,"Seriously, this look is fierce."
50877,Did you put it together yourself?
50878,You have major talent and a good eye!
50879,*big internet mom hugs to you!!
50880,*
50881,Happy Pride!
50882,I’m your mom now.
50883,"Oh sweetie, it sucks so bad if you can't share your true self with your parents."
50884,I've been there.
50885,The rejection of a parent is scarring.
50886,Their well-meant advice sometimes only twists the knife.
50887,I'm sorry you have to go through this.
50888,The best thing I can say is: lots of hugs for you!
50889,You're awesome!
50890,"You're overcoming a massive struggle, you're reflecting on yourself and choosing the life you want to live."
50891,That's strong as heck.
50892,You're an inspiration for others.
50893,And try to see and embrace the love and support of your chosen family and friend surrounding you at times like this.
50894,"She's only one person, while there are so many supporting you!"
50895,Lots of hugs and admiration for you from this internet-mom.
50896,Keep shining bright gem!
50897,<3
50898,I really wish I could give you a hug!
50899,Don’t ever let anyone tell you you should hide yourself.
50900,You’re beautiful inside and out.
50901,You deserve love and support!
50902,"If you can’t get that from your bio parents, we’re always here for you."
50903,I mean that sincerely.
50904,"Btw, you look absolutely fabulous!"
50905,What a great outfit.
50906,I think it’s adorable and fun!
50907,You should be able to enjoy yourself.
50908,You look so fuckin' cute!
50909,Now you keep up feeling good and being yourself.
50910,Where’d you get the skirt?
50911,It’s super cute!
50912,Your bi auntie here: you're SLAYING!!!
50913,And I am so proud of you for being out and proud at Pride!
50914,I hope you know that being authentically yourself takes major courage.
50915,You are brave and vibrant and deserve to be happy and comfortable in your own skin.
50916,Your mom can kick rocks if she's not on board with that.
50917,"I can't get any except the first photo to load, but you look amazing and I love your style!"
50918,"You look amazing, my love."
50919,What mom wouldn't endorse something that so obviously makes you happy!
50920,That smile is the best accessory ever.
50921,"Keep smiling, and keep doing what makes you smile."
50922,"You look awesome, hunny!!"
50923,I
50924,Happy pride sis!
50925,You are beautiful!
50926,Make up is out of this world!
50927,Keep strong beautiful 🙏🏼❤️
50928,You look incredible!
50929,"If you ask me, your parents are missing out on the amazing person you're becoming."
50930,Remember that you don't need their approval to be happy.
50931,All the love in the world is around you and inside you.
50932,❤️❤️❤️
50933,I've been on T for 3 years now and out as trans for 6.
50934,"While my parents are great now with my pronouns, name & calling me their son to other people- it took a REALLY LONG TIME for them to get to that point."
50935,"I had been thinking about my gender identity for many years before I told them, but from their point of view it happened overnight."
50936,"I was lucky enough to have physical space from them while I transitioned, but it took about a year of 'grey rock'ing them before we were ready to rebuild our relationship."
50937,The beginning is the hardest.
50938,You're just starting this journey and will have to convince so many people that you know what you're doing.
50939,"Be firm in your beliefs, but gentle with your feelings."
50940,Only you know what's best for you.
50941,Feel free to reach out if you need to vent
50942,"OMG you look SO cute, my sweet sibling."
50943,"Those boots, the kilt, the makeup... Just fantastic!"
50944,I hope your pride was as fun and delightful as you are.
50945,"Can I borrow some of your style because, hot damn!"
50946,"Keep being your bad, awesome self!"
50947,"Love your style, you look amazing sweetheart."
50948,Your Pride look is amazing!
50949,You’re gorgeous and I am so proud of you for being true to yourself.
50950,Sending lots of love and hugs.
50951,"Happy Pride, from your Bi sis!!"
50952,You look fantastic!
50953,Two things.
50954,1.
50955,You have grown into a very good looking person.
50956,Well done!
50957,2.
50958,I love that skirt and you are wearing it fantastically.
50959,"Lastly, this mum is proud of you for having the courage to be yourself."
50960,I know it’s hard.
50961,I know it can come with pain and heartache but persevere because you are worth it xx
50962,You're amazing!
50963,"Be yourself and enjoy your life

Negativity is hard to deal with, especially when it comes from people you care about, and who care about you."
50964,"But other people's opinions do not have to become your reality

All the very best!"
50965,You look amazing!
50966,I'm sorry your Mom is struggling with this but you have to live your own life and be happy inside your own skin.
50967,I'm proud of you for living your truth.
50968,This momma couldn't be more proud of you.
50969,And you are killing it with that outfit.
50970,"I’m no mom, I enjoy my aunt roll."
50971,So if it’s ok…aunty thinks you look absolute amazing!!
50972,The makeup?
50973,Stunning!
50974,The fit?
50975,SLAY!!!!
50976,You’re doing amazing and I’m really proud of you for finding who you are and finally living your life!🫶🏼
50977,That skirt is super cute and now I want one.
50978,You look fabulous and I’m glad you’re happy.
50979,Momma here.
50980,First of all- whatever makes *you* happy is something I fully support.
50981,"Even if I don’t understand it, agree with it, or maybe would do things differently."
50982,Because a mother’s love is not conditional.
50983,"As long as you are comfortable in your own skin, feeling fulfilled and living your best life, what more could a mom want?"
50984,You look incredible.
50985,Serious David Bowie vibes and I’m in love with it.
50986,Remember that sometimes it’s better to be loved than to be right.
50987,"Remember that because the next time you get told “sometimes I’m right” you can remind them that if being right is more important than love, they stand to alienate themselves further."
50988,"**Comment about grammar and spelling removed- I don’t want to perpetuate any shame towards those who take on English as another language and having seen the clarification, the comment is no longer relevant**

You moved out and are taking care of yourself."
50989,That’s an incredible feat.
50990,Be judicious with your time and firm with your boundaries.
50991,You can love your parents from afar.
50992,"You’re not obligated to put your own mental health at risk, in the name of being a good child."
50993,So don’t.
50994,The love you deserve and the love you have received are not compatible.
50995,"Stick with your tribe- be the truest you that you can be, unapologetically."
50996,Because this mom is so fucking proud of you.
50997,I’m dead she brought up ruby rose.
50998,"Hey sib, I don’t have a whole lot of emotional space for support, but you look FUCKING AMAZING and there is nothing quite like that first Out Pride feeling."
50999,Really big hugs from your enby fam 💖
51000,You look wild and amazing.
51001,I love your outfit and your makeup is very impressive.
51002,I hope you get opportunities to dress like this more often and show off these outfits!
51003,Your look is spectacular!
51004,Block out the haters with your queer ass style and live your best life pal.
51005,You are the only person you need to impress and love.
51006,♥️
51007,You look amazing.
51008,This mom is super proud of you for living and being your true self ❤️
51009,"First of all, your pride look is STUNNING!"
51010,"Second of all and more importantly, you don't owe your mother any explanation and the fact you provided one is more than she deserves."
51011,She knows what she and your father did to hurt you.
51012,Her pinning this on you is another attempt to make herself the victim.
51013,"YOU are the victim here, not her."
51014,And you have risen above your hardships to become a shining star.
51015,I know every day is a hard climb upwards but you will reach the top of your mountain and leave them far behind.
51016,"That is a hella cute outfit and look, and I’m proud of you!"
51017,I love the boots.
51018,"😭😭❤️❤️

-agender sibling"
51019,you look fabulous and i would be so proud to have you as my child.
51020,You look great
51021,I have no idea what your mom is trying to say with her word vomit.
51022,"You, however, look great."
51023,I absolutely love that outfit.
51024,You look amazing my love!
51025,Did you do your makeup?
51026,It looks so great those colors are beautiful on you!
51027,I'm happy to sew you blossoming into the beautiful person I always see and I hope the world sees!
51028,Happy pride!!
51029,!
51030,You're gorgeous and you look amazing!
51031,"Hey, sibling, you look fabulous!"
51032,"I'm so jealous of your eye makeup, it's amazing."
51033,"I'm so sorry mom isn't supportive, and I know that hurts, but you are so strong and beautiful when you're being yourself, so please keep doing you."
51034,Absolutely adorable outfit!
51035,And im sorry that your bio-parents haven’t been supportive.
51036,"Also, your sporran is not sitting properly, they are meant to be worn center front."
51037,Not sure if you knew so I thought I’d point it out but either way it’s adorable.
51038,I just messaged you about my pretty surreal same experience as a trans person on hormones.
51039,I completely get how this feels.
51040,My mom also sends me these long paragraphs that are very offensive and transphobic.
51041,She and my dad send articles to me about people who detransitioned and other links all the time.
51042,It’s been years and years.
51043,"I’m on testosterone and I have a beard, and they still say stuff about me."
51044,"I understand how you feel, and you know yourself better than anyone else."
51045,I’m proud of you for responding back and you don’t deserve her breath.
51046,I hope you can continue to love yourself as you are trying to do!
51047,Much love -Zach
51048,You look amazing!
51049,"You have support from your other mums and sisters and family from around the world, love a mum from Australia xx"
51050,You look gorgeous and your mom is an asshole.
51051,"She seems to be an asshole who loves you to the best of her ability, but her ability is, frankly, pathetically small."
51052,She clearly needs to focus on fixing herself instead of projecting all her issues with herself onto you.
51053,"Anyway, I am so sorry you're dealing with that shit."
51054,"I live in Canada, but I'll be family if you need accepting and caring family!"
51055,"I'm screwed up, but super aware of it and constantly working on myself, so it's like a healthy screwed up."
51056,:)
51057,Happy Pride from a trans brother.
51058,I know those kinds of talks from my parents as well...
51059,"I'm really proud of how you for standing up for yourself, and I want to suggest something, you've probably thought of as well..."
51060,"It might be a good idea to just cut them out...   
Yeah, they're family, but you can't chose who you're related to, and sometimes, they just happen to be unaccepting... and you should think of yourself, before you think of them."
51061,"Also, I just want to say, that that is some gorgeous make up...   
You look amazing."
51062,You look fantastic!
51063,😍 ❤️
51064,Love it!
51065,You look amazing and deserve to celebrate who you are!
51066,!
51067,I'm so sorry you're not getting the love and support you deserve.
51068,"Your outfit is amazing, and you look fantastic."
51069,"I wish you the absolute best on your journey, and am sending you a bunch of mom love."
51070,💕
51071,"A small suggestion, skim thru you mother’s messages and focus on the nice words."
51072,"She thinks you look gorgeous, as do the rest of us."
51073,The rest is just back ground noise.
51074,You cannot please everyone and sometimes it is not even worth your time to try.
51075,"Just nod your head, roll you eyes when she is not looking and continue to be your fabulous self."
51076,You look amazing 🤩 !
51077,Oh wow you look amazing!!
51078,Those boots are to die for!
51079,You look amazing!
51080,That outfit is just perfect.
51081,I'm so sorry your family is not giving you the support that you deserve.
51082,"You are a beautiful person, and I wish you a wonderful Pride month."
51083,Lots of hugs to you!
51084,"You look amazing, darling, and so happy, at that!"
51085,I think it’s so important to acknowledge that so many people’s mental health improves drastically once they are able to present themselves as the gender they are (not to mention escaping from belittling forces in their lives.)
51086,"There is such a bright future ahead for you, and you’ve got at least one PERFECT outfit to greet it in."
51087,Oh my science!
51088,You look fabulous!
51089,Pat Benatar eat your heart out!
51090,"Honey, you can only do you."
51091,"It's great when others get it or accept you, but sometimes, you just have to walk your path and wait for others to catch up."
51092,Sometimes they do.
51093,Sometimes God places others in your life to love and support you.
51094,I wish you a great happy Pride.
51095,Great response.
51096,“Even a blind chicken finds a kernel sometime” lol I’m going to be using that one as soon as I can!!
51097,!
51098,Dad here!
51099,"I mean, I don't know anything about anything, but those boots!"
51100,That makeup!
51101,You're killing it.
51102,Hey !
51103,Little bro who's starting a lot of processes to transition here.
51104,"I suck with words but goddamnit, you look stunning and inspiring!"
51105,"My parents arent supportive at all as well, and i can understand how heavy it can be sometimes, but please do not be ever slowed in your life by people who never were present enough for you !"
51106,you rockkkk :)
51107,Everything about your makeup and outfit is INCREDIBLE.
51108,You could be on the cover of Vogue magazine.
51109,"I'm sorry your mom doesn't understand what being trans is, nor that the official treatment recommended by the medical community is gender-identigy-confirming hormones and surgeries."
51110,You know yourself and what is right for you.
51111,"She may think she knows what is best, but her judgment is totally clouded by bigotry and by her own desires of how you should conform."
51112,"I know that you want her to change, but it may be super slow or it may never come at all."
51113,I feel like staying in contact with her is continuing to harm you.
51114,You should consider going low contact or no contact with her for the next few years and just focus on getting to know yourself and getting therapy to navigate that process and to heal from the hatred you've received.
51115,It is not your job to fix her or placate her.
51116,Your only job is to be happy and healthy.
51117,And your mom may no longer have a place in those things.
51118,"I'm so sorry, but we all love you and support you here."
51119,I hope you have an amazing Price Month despite everything!
51120,Hold your LGBTQ friends extra tight for me!
51121,💖💖💖
51122,Just some random dude here.
51123,Im sorry that you're going through what you are right now.
51124,"I dont(and probably can't) understand how you're feeling, but please know you're value is not determined by other people (including, but not limited to your parents)."
51125,"I,an internet stranger, wish only the best for you."
51126,Now go forth spread your beauty to the world!!
51127,!
51128,"I want the skirt, makeup, everything!"
51129,It just works!
51130,I would like to see you going to therapy.
51131,You probably do have some issues to work on since your family is like this.
51132,I also would love to see you continue to find yourself!
51133,You have such a great sense of style.
51134,You are beautiful 😍!
51135,"Not a mom, but a dad, and I love your makeup."
51136,I'm getting major Ziggy Stardust vibes.
51137,You look awesome and your mother’s message is deeply incomprehensible.
51138,Is she usually hard to understand through text?
51139,"If not, I might call some family that can work as a neutral party to go over and check on her, and see if doing alright mentally."
51140,"It would not be your fault if she wasn’t, that would be hers for placing so much of her sustained mental health on her ability to control your medical choices, so don’t feel guilty if she does need help./gen"
51141,I believe you just delivered one heck of a paddling to a broadside enemy battleship.
51142,Excellent work comrade.
51143,"&#x200B;

Also that fit is fire."
51144,❤🧡💛💚💙🤎🖤🤍
51145,Seriously this picture is lit!
51146,You look epic!
51147,Happy Pride Month!
51148,"We can't choose our family of origin, but we can choose our real family and I hope you are celebrating with them and are surrounded by the love and support you deserve!"
51149,That is the perfect amount of too much.
51150,Love it.
51151,"You are wonderful and deserve love, joy and euphoria."
51152,just want to share that i’m excited for your journey of yourself.
51153,"you get to be anything you want, present yourself how you want, make mistakes, create successes, find inspiration, discover your interior destiny and make the external any representation of that you wish."
51154,sending love as you navigate.
51155,i recommend “the jeffrey marsh” on social media just to feel an extra dose of love and acceptance.
51156,don’t be afraid to reach out for emergency therapeutic resources if you need someone to talk to and just express yourself freely.
51157,sending love.
51158,That's a great look!
51159,I love it!
51160,I saw your pic even before what sub it was on and just wanted to give you a big hug.
51161,Your look is so awesome and this Momma loves you for you.
51162,You are not alone.
51163,You are amazing and you will always be loved by all of us.
51164,"Honey, I’m so proud of you for doing the work to find yourself."
51165,Let me know how I can help!
51166,❤️
51167,Your look is amazing and delightfully non-binary.
51168,I hope you have fun at Pride celebrations and keep yourself safe.
51169,You look fabulous.
51170,You look happy.
51171,That's what matters.
51172,Keep doing what makes you happy.
51173,You'll always find support here.
51174,Oh and  make sure you drink your water today.
51175,🖤
51176,You have absolutely NAILED that look!!!
51177,Both the pride look and the androgyny look!!
51178,"I classify myself a pomosexual because my sexual preferences are complicated, I was brainwashed by Christianity as a child, and I’m now married to a man so I’ll never be able to really explore - but that being said, androgyny is my thing and you are 🔥🔥🔥"
51179,"Sweetie, you look incredible."
51180,You're giving me vibes of Magenta from Rocky Horror.
51181,It's an old movie from your Mama's time but I'm sure you've heard of it.
51182,"You make me proud love, you've come so far."
51183,Oh sweet child.
51184,You are pure sunshine.
51185,You are beautiful.
51186,Sometimes parents get their heads stuck up their asses with their ideas set in stone and don't realize how hurtful and hateful it becomes.
51187,None of that is about you.
51188,I hope someday she can see what beauty and love you put in the world.
51189,"Keep being you, boo."
51190,"eta: you are clean and well groomed, your skin looks flawless so you are obvs taking showers and being clean- whatever that was about."
51191,You look ah-mazing!
51192,Im so proud of you for embracing yourself.
51193,Sending you mom hugs and love!
51194,"My daughter is only four, so I feel like I don't have the experience to call myself ""mom for a minute"", but if it matters, I think your make up looks freaking amazing."
51195,That whole outfit kicks ass.
51196,Keep being you.
51197,Don't change for ANYONE.
51198,"I'm sorry that your bio parents aren't supportive, but this mama is 100% supportive."
51199,You rocked that outfit!
51200,You look AMAZING.
51201,You look AH-MAZING!
51202,You have to be *who you were born to be.
51203,"* It's really difficult when parents aren't equipped (for whatever reason) to embrace you, hopefully time will change that."
51204,"If it doesn't live your best life and love them anyway, despite their shortcomings."
51205,"Do this from afar if you have to, but *GO LIVE, LOVE AND BE HAPPY."
51206,"* 

There are many moms like me who have our own LGBTQ kids and many more we've adopted along the way."
51207,"We love you, and that love is unconditional."
51208,♥️
51209,"Even a blind chicken sometimes finds a kernel…..
Thats hilarious & Im stealing it!"
51210,You are rocking this!
51211,Absolutely beautiful 🤩
51212,You look amazing.
51213,I’m so happy that you are becoming the person that you want to be.
51214,"You GET IT, girl!"
51215,You look fantastic and your make up is fire!
51216,"You look lovely, lovey!!"
51217,I hope you had an amazing time!
51218,!
51219,Your Pride look is absolute fire!!!
51220,"You look so confident, poised, and ready to take on the world!"
51221,"That’s who you truly are at your core, regardless of what your mom or anyone else says."
51222,Major kudos to you for honouring who you are and embracing your true identity.❤️
51223,Yoooo your eye make up is on point!
51224,"My family still struggles with my gender identity (non-binary) and I haven’t even told them I started T (I have lupus which complicates everything and I don’t want them blaming flares on T — I didn’t even start T until recently after finishing chemo for a bad flare and I did so with the full knowledge of my medical team, but I still worry they will blame it)."
51225,When I was home last I was hairless from chemo and my mom insisted on telling everyone I was her daughter and just didn’t have hair because I went through chemo and it mostly fell out so I shaved it completely bald to not be patchy.
51226,It’s coming back now but I think I will keep it short.
51227,Anyway I have some idea of what this is like and what I can say is that you’re doing the right thing going to Pride.
51228,Over time you will build a queer family and they will be your rock and you will have a place to be your full self and it’s in that place you will no longer feel like a part of you is zipped away in the painful confines of a dark closet.
51229,Closet is a good metaphor but maybe it’s more like casket.
51230,Or one of those walk in freezers.
51231,Anyway you don’t need to place parts of you in that dark cold place for anyone.
51232,"You deserve to be out, to be free, to be happy, to be you."
51233,It gets better.
51234,Im 34 and live in another state from my family.
51235,"Big parts of me miss them but at least as it relates to this, the distance can be helpful in mediating when and how I engage with these perspectives."
51236,You DO look absolutely incredible in that picture!
51237,I’m proud of you for responding to her text with maturity and assertiveness.
51238,It was a perfect response and I’m proud of you for that!
51239,"Darling, you are crushing it!"
51240,You look absolutely amazing.
51241,"What a nice sporran, I see you are a person of culture as well."
51242,You look very gorgeous sweetie.
51243,Glad you had a blast.
51244,Stick with the positive people in your life.
51245,Happy Pride!
51246,🏳️‍🌈
51247,Advice from an old straight guy: be you!
51248,Be happy.
51249,Love yourself.
51250,Life is too short not to.
51251,"If others can’t figure out how to love you, that’s their problem."
51252,I know it hurts.
51253,But just keep loving yourself and trying to reflect back the negativity with as much compassion as you can muster.
51254,Trans man here.
51255,You look awesome - your makeup is super impressive and your outfit is really nice!
51256,You _should_ be proud.
51257,"You're working to embrace a more authentic version of yourself, which is incredibly difficult and needs to be celebrated."
51258,Best of luck to you.
51259,❤️
51260,I'll be your family!
51261,"As a mom that made a rule that my kids couldn’t do anything permanent until they were 18, I respect your mom warning you about making permanent changes to your body without appropriate consideration to how it affects your future."
51262,"However, I also think you look fabulous and only you can know what the right changes are to help you feel your authentic self."
51263,Only you can decide the timeline for those changes.
51264,Only you know the severity of your own dysmorphia and the best way to get through it.
51265,I’m sorry your mom can’t be more supportive.
51266,I hope she can get there in time.
51267,Your mom is just jealous of how fabulous you look and how well you can paint.
51268,"Baby, you look AMAZING."
51269,I’m so proud of you.
51270,"ETA the shoes, the makeup, the SKIRT!!"
51271,🔥🔥🔥🔥
51272,Mom here- you look 😍🤩.
51273,I hope my kids will be as brave as you someday.
51274,"Oh, honey, this internet grandma thinks you look stunning & adorable!"
51275,"I love the outfit, and the homage to Bowie."
51276,"Never worry about your mom’s,or anyone else’s opinion."
51277,"You are meant to live your life for you, not anyone else."
51278,"Be you, be happy, and keep rockin’ those amazing outfits!"
51279,I think you did the absolute best thing.
51280,"You have to safeguard your mental and emotional health, even when it means turning away from certain people."
51281,I think you look amazing!!
51282,I love everything about your outfit!
51283,I'm so happy that you are embracing your true self.
51284,You are beautiful and I love you.
51285,Why she … talk like that?
51286,That message didn’t make any sense at all.
51287,"You look amazing, kiddo!"
51288,WHY DO PARENTS WRITE LIKE THIS?
51289,IT'S UNREADABLE.
51290,I have plenty of “family” members who simply are not worth even thinking about.
51291,Family is a doing word.
51292,What she’s doing disqualifies her from the role.
51293,Find your family in your community.
51294,Don’t let her past negativity cloud your journey.
51295,Just walk and don’t look back.
51296,You do you!
51297,And you look fantastic!
51298,You rock that outfit!
51299,Hope your parents can come to their senses and accept you for who you are and not what they want you to be.
51300,Oh my gosh that pride look 🥰 you looked AMAZING!
51301,"You look great, have a lovely outfit and most importantly you look happy."
51302,You deserve that and disregard anyone who gets in the way of that
51303,You look incredible!
51304,I adore your outfit and your makeup and you look fantastic!
51305,I’m so proud of you kiddo!
51306,Your makeup is awesome!
51307,"You look amazing, remember you only need you to believe in yourself."
51308,No one else matters as long as you are happy (p.s.
51309,I am so proud of you!)
51310,BESTIE YOU LOOK SO GOOD!!!
51311,😍❤️‍🔥🥵
51312,"Darling, you look amazing."
51313,I'm so proud of you.
51314,Happy Pride!
51315,Kiddo your look is fierce!!!
51316,I’m so proud you are living your authentic self.
51317,Sending lots of sage hugs.
51318,Super cute look
51319,You look super cute from head to toe.
51320,I’m glad pride was good for you and to you!
51321,"You literally ARE going through adolescence, between the hormones and growing into yourself."
51322,I honestly didn’t even make it through half of that toddler version of a glued together ransom note.
51323,Both because she/it sucks and because it is not even readable.
51324,Was she on a codeine trip when she was smashing the keyboard?
51325,It may be time to take a break from the parents and put them on an info diet.
51326,Not everyone deserves the VIP pass to access you as a person.
51327,"I’m guessing she saw that on fb, either unfriend her or lockdown her access to nothing."
51328,Be aware other family may try to show her stuff so any fencesitting fam might need to go into the same info diet group as her.
51329,"I don’t want to sound dismissive and like this isn’t hard or upsetting, but if she stops being awful it’s going to be under her own steam and on her own time."
51330,Don’t give her the ammunition to fuck with you and treat you like this.
51331,I’m straight but from my perspective the alphabet mafia tends to be very good at creating the urban tribe and the chosen family.
51332,I hope you can find some comfort in that fact and can eventually find your people and your family.
51333,💕
51334,I think you look beautiful and glowing.
51335,I would be proud to say you were my child.
51336,Be you and keep shining bright.
51337,"My love, you look so beautiful in your pride month outfit!!!"
51338,I hope you had a blast!!
51339,I’m so proud of you for being yourself and being willing to go on your own journey.
51340,You’re so strong and deserve every happiness life has in store for you.
51341,Please send us updates on how you are doing.
51342,❤️
51343,If someone says to you ‘not looking for a discussion’ after they have opened a discussion that tells you all you really need to know.
51344,"Omfg, Sis, your outfit is too goooood!"
51345,I need that skirt & those boots desperately!!
51346,😍
51347,This is a look !
51348,I hope you had / have a great time at pride .
51349,"You look amazing, sib!"
51350,"This big sis is proud af, you freaking KILLLLEDDD that eye look!"
51351,!
51352,Hey just scrolling past on r/all.
51353,"Not a mom but I would love to know where you got that skirt, the shirt, the shoes, and the pouch thing."
51354,You’re absolutely crushing it and I’m sorry your mom is a butthead.
51355,Like that makeup is to die for come on.
51356,Also that response is really eloquent and well worded.
51357,You’re killing it and that haircut really suits you.
51358,You look amazing.
51359,I have no clue what your mother is saying.
51360,"Is she actually a large bird, who is trying desperately to communicate?"
51361,"http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html?m=1

Who cares what she thinks."
51362,You do you and be happy.
51363,❤
51364,"Hey honey, you look beautiful, and I’m so happy you found acceptance at Pride!"
51365,"It’s a sad fact in this world that sometimes our blood relatives don’t deserve us, so we have to make our own family out of friends."
51366,I hope you will consider protecting yourself from trauma by cutting off contact with people who cause you harm.
51367,"Even just for a month, to see if it improves your wellbeing."
51368,You look GORG!
51369,And confident and happy and like YOU!
51370,"Sorry the 'rents aren't supportive, but make your own family."
51371,You've got this!
51372,You look GORGEOUS and your bio mom is *so* wrong.
51373,I hope you had fun at Pride and you know that you are so loved.
51374,OH MY GOD YOU LOOK AMAZING
51375,I LOVE that eye makeup!
51376,"I'm  sorry your other mother is so terrified of being seen as less than perfect herself, that she keeps forgetting and missing that you are actually pretty amazing already."
51377,Omg this look is amazing!
51378,I would be proud to have you for a kid.
51379,Keep being you!
51380,Xoxo
51381,"/r/shorthairedhotties 

Seriously, though, I'm thinking of cutting my hair short and love your look."
51382,You look so radiant and your boots are KILLER.
51383,Keep kickin for your rights <3
51384,"Not mum, but sister here."
51385,YOU LOOK AMAZING!
51386,Goddamn keep shining my little star ♥️
51387,Bi-mom here; I have one ace kid and one bi kid.
51388,I think you are *amazing*.
51389,"Your presentation is utterly fantastic, the look is outstanding."
51390,"I have a narcissistic bio!mom, too."
51391,I don’t speak to her because she’s like this.
51392,Disengage.
51393,"You will likely feel some guilt, a lingering “I can’t do that, she’s my mom, what if I break her heart” kind of feeling."
51394,It’s hard.
51395,It goes away.
51396,"When you realize you’re doing so much better than you were, when your phone buzzes in your pocket one afternoon and your stomach *doesn’t* drop in dread because it *could* be her?"
51397,That’s when it starts to feel better.
51398,Wishing you nothing but the best vibes!
51399,"To be honest, it seems like she isn't blaming it on T. She seems anxious for you to be happy ans she's wondering if hormones will be dangerous to your mood if you already have depression/depressive tendencies."
51400,She's worried.
51401,"Maybe she doesn't quite understand the whole trans thing and the lgbt community, but I don't think she's a hater."
51402,"That being said, I hope she understands more some day."
51403,I hope you'll start to feel more and more like YOU.
51404,"You look amazing, the look is on fucking point!"
51405,Greetings from another European ❤
51406,I will be your substitute mom.
51407,You look great.
51408,Surround yourself with supportive people.
51409,You have a right to be who you are.
51410,You’re glowing!
51411,Let the world know you are (as long as this feels right for you).
51412,Anybody that is mean to you is threatened by your light ♥️ find people who love the authentic you and that you can be yourself around!
51413,Omg the braces and bowtie match ❤️❤️❤️
51414,your first look for pride is absolutely amazing.
51415,i love your style so much and you look great.
51416,"i’m so sorry that your biological parents aren’t accepting, but you have a lot of love from your bi sibling (me) ❤️"
51417,Why those people **always** say that someone is making us to be trans?
51418,"Like someone is forcing us to be trans, and not us being us and who we are."
51419,"We are trans, that is who we are."
51420,No one is forcing us to be trans and no one is making us trans.
51421,She is full of crap..
51422,"I am sorry.. 

To me HRT and people that supported me and loved actual me were the ones that that help me get better, thanks to them i am alive."
51423,"You deserve much better, and you look fabulous!"
51424,Hang in there!!!
51425,Don't ever give up on yourself no matter what.
51426,You absolute fucking badass I'm so proud of you!
51427,Can you come teach this Mum how to makeup?
51428,You look awesome!
51429,I hope my trans kidlet has your confidence and attitude towards unsupportive people as he grows up (and your sense of style!!)
51430,"You really look great, honey."
51431,The outfit is spot on.
51432,You look absolutely fabulous!
51433,Your shirt is fire!!!
51434,"Live how you like, wear anything you want and be genuinely you!"
51435,We live only once and it would be a shame to hide ourselves on account of a few people who don’t like it.
51436,Happy pride month!
51437,You could come to pride with me .
51438,"It's my first time and I'm giving ""free mom hugs""."
51439,"Because everyone needs a ""mom hug""."
51440,You are rockin your outfit and look fab.
51441,I am a proud mom in real life too.
51442,"Also , I am an ally."
51443,𝘓𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘪𝘴 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦.
51444,Wow.
51445,You.
51446,Are.
51447,Stunning.
51448,Look at you!
51449,Rocking that look.
51450,Totally put together.
51451,I wish my pride outfits were half as fab.
51452,Don’t hide.
51453,Be yourself.
51454,Shout it from the rooftops in all your rainbow glory.
51455,Roar.
51456,"Seriously, use your voice and ignore the haters."
51457,Even when they’re your bio mom.
51458,"Your are a glorious, vibrant individual."
51459,You deserve to express yourself and be yourself.
51460,I am so proud of you for taking this opportunity and just glowing.
51461,"Love, light, and rainbows from your AK mom."
51462,💕
51463,"Hey, I just randomly found this sub and your post."
51464,"First off, you look beautiful!"
51465,"The posture, the outfit, the make-up, the smile..."
51466,Damn!
51467,"I don't really want to judge anyone, but let me tell you this..."
51468,Sometimes it just feels really good to cut toxic relationships out for a while and LIVE.
51469,I genuinely feel happy for you that you got the chance to go to your first Pride and be amongst people who celebrate each other instead of spreading completely unecessary negativity.
51470,I hope you are doing well!
51471,You look lovely.
51472,"Your mom’s message shows she cares, but she’s misguided."
51473,It isn’t your fault and there’s only so much you can do.
51474,"Your message conveys that you care too, you were patient, honest, and stood up for yourself."
51475,You’re an amazing daughter and person.
51476,Protect your energy and live YOUR truth because it’s beautiful.
51477,Your makeup looks great.
51478,Sending love from your pan big sis.
51479,Ps.
51480,Lol at “bold spots” your hair is thick and lustrous afaict.
51481,But you are BOLD in a good way with your rainbows 🌈
51482,You honestly look so cool.
51483,And you look happy.
51484,That should be any parents dream come true 🤌🏽✨
51485,The first Pride experience is epic and emotional on all kinds of levels.
51486,I went to Chicago and then lived there for awhile.
51487,I was near tears when we watched the aids riders come rolling in by the hundreds.
51488,All in different shirts to represent the rainbow.
51489,I could feel the elation and exhaustion as they rode all the way from Milwaukee.
51490,Good for you.
51491,A super nice group of friends took me.
51492,"I'm loving this fit, hella good job kiddo ❤️"
51493,I love the outfit - someone else’s mom 😃
51494,You may want to take your mom's picture off of the screenshot posted.
51495,Your outfit is awesome!!
51496,!
51497,"Oh my gosh, you look FANTASTIC!"
51498,This mom is so proud of you!
51499,OMG how BEAUTIFUL you look!
51500,"Strength and power, sister!"
51501,"To quote one of my favorite songs, ""It's alright, we'll survive, cuz parents ain't always right."""
51502,You look downright incredible.
51503,That makeup!
51504,Those boots!
51505,You are absolutely slaying!
51506,Never apologize for being true to yourself.
51507,And what a badass the true you is!
51508,Happy Pride!
51509,Happy pride!!
51510,"Sib here, you look absolutely stunning😍 love the tie and makeup!"
51511,!💕
51512,OP.
51513,You're an absolute stunner and that's one heck of a look.
51514,I refuse to go through the verbal diarrhoea spewed by your bio-mom but I will wish you all the love in the world.
51515,Congratulations on transitioning.
51516,You look gorgeous and I love your makeup.
51517,Don't ever let your bio parents hold you back from who you are.
51518,Happy Pride!
51519,"I am so sorry, sweetheart!"
51520,I love your outfit and am extraordinarily proud of you and your self-knowledge.
51521,Your mom is clearly struggling and her garbled message is alarming.
51522,But this may be a case where your own self-confidence and persistence will keep you strong until you are able to put some space between you and your mom.
51523,"You've said what you needed to say, and I hope you will always be your own best advocate, even though I'm behind you 100%"
51524,I am ridiculously jealous of your makeup skills - you look amazing!
51525,"You also look happy, and that is priceless!"
51526,"FWIW, I’m a mom to 2 enbys,and one cis-het son, and surrogate mom to several more, and I’m always looking for more kids!"
51527,Love from mom ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
51528,Happy pride!
51529,You look amazing and your makeup looks amazing too!!
51530,"I'm sorry you're getting discouraging comments from your mom, that sucks."
51531,"I will say from experience that T will affect hair loss, that's just part of it, but there are things you can do during this time to mitigate that, if that's a concern for you."
51532,But aside from that you look amazing and you seem very happy in this photo 😍
51533,Hi baby!
51534,I’m a momma here to a Trans baby.
51535,I can’t say where your mom is coming from.
51536,But what I can say is I hope that one day my daughter finds her courage like you and I can see that confidence in her like the confidence emanating from you here.
51537,You are beautiful and so so so loved!
51538,"I make mistakes so often with my kiddo, but I know I love her more than the world itself."
51539,I hope your mom figures it out.
51540,I hope she realizes how beautiful it is to see the real you daily.
51541,"But even if she doesn’t, this internet mama is proud of you, happy for you, and hoping you keep learning to love yourself and be yourself♥️💙💜💛💚🧡"
51542,"Happy pride from your bisexual sister ❤️

You look wonderful, the makeup is especially gorgeous!"
51543,I'm so sorry your mother does not accept this but we all do ❤️
51544,You look amazing!!
51545,This Mama is so proud of you for being so brave and not letting your bio mom shoot you down.
51546,I would have been proud to attend a Pride parade with you!
51547,Sending you lots of love and hugs ❤️
51548,You look AMAZING!!
51549,!
51550,"From your big sister, you look AMAZING 😍 please teach me how you did your make up, I'm a total beginner"
51551,"Hey, it’s your Reddit aunt here."
51552,I am so sorry that your parents fail to see the positives about your transition 🏳️‍⚧️and that you feel judged and less than.
51553,However I do think that your mother really cares for you and her heart is in the right place just very misguided here.
51554,"If you have the strength to show them grace do that, if not I don’t blame you for removing yourself from them forever or just for a while."
51555,"Be you, always!"
51556,Sending you lots of love!
51557,Happy pride!
51558,You look amazing!
51559,I hope you can see how awesome you are!
51560,I'm the mom of a child who is still figuring out who they are.
51561,"If they end up transitioning, I will love them the same, as they are my child."
51562,"To you, OP, and anyone else who is struggling to be who they truly are, I'm your mom now."
51563,"I support you, I love you, and I want only the best for you."
51564,Thank you for including me in your journey.
51565,I can't wait to see where this world takes you!
51566,❤🧡💛💚💙💜
51567,First thing’s first- I absolutely ADORE your entire look!
51568,I can tell you probably put a lot of thought and effort into it.
51569,"I love the shoes you paired with the clothes, the skirt is to die for and I want one, the way you styled your shirt is so cute, and don’t even get me started on your makeup."
51570,LOVE.
51571,I love the whole thing and you look gorgeous!
51572,"Ok, onto the crux of the issue."
51573,I grew up in a family like this.
51574,“What will people think” was how my family lived.
51575,I felt stifled; I couldn’t be myself.
51576,"At my worst, I felt like I was suffocating."
51577,It wasn’t until I stopped caring about “what will people think” that I finally felt free to live my life.
51578,And that applied to what my own family would think.
51579,"I did not care who it was, blood or not, I did not care."
51580,I hit my breaking point and said fuck it and just started being me.
51581,Nothing I say can make up for the pain that having parents like this causes.
51582,All I can do is be as supportive as possible.
51583,So just know that I will gladly be your older queer sister and be there for you whenever you need.
51584,This internet stranger loves you and is SO PROUD of who you are and who you will grow to be.
51585,"You keep being you, no matter what."
51586,You are amazing and wonderful and fabulous just as you are.
51587,That is your power and no one can take that away from you.
51588,💜
51589,"Sibling here, I’m so proud of you for standing up for yourself & your happiness, it’s not an easy thing to do!"
51590,Many people (in your mother’s generation nonetheless) spend their ENTIRE LIVES being unhappy & staying in the closet because they were worried what others will think.
51591,They had to kill a part of themselves just to appear “normal” & it’s so amazing that we don’t live in that time anymore & can be who we are🥰you deserve happiness.
51592,You deserve to feel at home in your body.
51593,"Human bodies are not perfect, & if you need to get it right then that’s perfectly fine & healthy!"
51594,People love to say “hormones are bad for your body” but what’s worse is the stress & depression that comes with not feeling “right” in your body.
51595,"What’s worse is the increase likelihood of suicide because of that, & hormone therapy is perfectly fine when done correctly!"
51596,"I’m so glad you have the opportunity to get on T, & I’ve heard that 2nd puberty thing SUCKS but the fact that you’re happier WITH IT shows that it’s the right choice."
51597,"I’m sorry your mom doesn’t see it that way, but I am so proud that you’re putting your happiness before her ignorance 🖤 and happy Pride!"
51598,!
51599,"I’m not your Mom, but I’m a Mom who loves you for who you are!❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
That outfit is amazing!!"
51600,!
51601,"Sweetie, you look amazing!"
51602,I'm proud of you for living your authentic self and doing what helps you be a happy and whole person.
51603,Happy Pride!
51604,"Be safe, wear sunscreen, and drink lots of water!"
51605,💚💚
51606,"Your pride look is 🔥🔥🔥 

I’m sorry your dealing with that kind of abuse from someone who is supposed to be supporting you."
51607,You're absolutely beautiful.
51608,"My child has struggled with her gender identity, and, while I don't understand it completely, they know that I am here for them no matter what and they will always have my unwavering support."
51609,I am sorry that your parents don't understand or support you.
51610,All the moms here do.
51611,"I hope that, in this month of pride, you are proud of yourself."
51612,I am.
51613,❤️
51614,Having concerns about taking hormones is legit.
51615,Long term use can lead to a whole host of health issues.
51616,"It sounds like she is genuinely worried about you, but I know how frustrating it is when a parent turns genuine concern into a condescending, toxic, bid for control."
51617,It can feel like total madness.
51618,"It’s often both things at the same time - real concern, and a pattern of trying to control."
51619,"I know you probably don’t want to hear this, but gender dysphoria often can be healed through years of the right kind of therapy."
51620,It would be awful if you did irreversible damage to your body now and then want to detransition later in life.
51621,"There actually is a growing number of detrans people talking about these issues, but you won’t hear about them or from them because they get silenced and exiled from the trans community, which, sorry to say, does often exhibit cult like behavior."
51622,"(Love bombing, telling people to cut out anyone in their life that has differing perspectives, and discarding anyone who veers even slightly away from strictly following the ideology… just a few examples)."
51623,I know what I’m saying is a very unpopular opinion with young people right now.
51624,"I’m in my 30s so I’m not too old, but I have been around long enough to see this trans movement explode and become a trendy social contagion."
51625,There’s a lot of youth who unfortunately are getting swept up in the fad and will regret any permanent decisions made later in life.
51626,And of course everyone thinks that will never be them.
51627,Expressing your masculine side without the use of hormones is totally a beautiful awesome thing.
51628,Exploring gender fluidity and dressing up and experimenting are all healthy ways of getting to know who you are and finding your true self.
51629,I support that!
51630,"It’s just the hormones and surgery that can be dangerous and can cause major, potentially devastating physical and psychological issues later in life."
51631,"Btw, you look awesome and super happy in the pic, I’m glad you’re feeling good."
51632,You deserve to feel good!
51633,I’m just trying to give some context to what I think your mom is getting at.
51634,You look amazing and I LOVE the skirt & boots combo!!
51635,I am so sorry you do not have the support you deserve from your parents.
51636,Your response was powerful and you look even more powerful.
51637,Keep rocking the look and standing up for yourself.
51638,You are a total badass and we are all so proud of you for being yourself.
51639,"<3

Another pride partier"
51640,I am proud of you.
51641,"You are finding yourself, and your voice."
51642,"You are becoming the person you want to be, the person you feel you are and are letting go of others expectations of you."
51643,This is a huge step.
51644,I know it is scary and at times painful.
51645,"But you are beautiful, strong, and well spoken."
51646,You've got this.
51647,Sending all my love.
51648,You look great!
51649,"For some people it will take them a long time to accept that you're not the person they thought you were, or I guess that you're still you but I'm not sure what exactly I'm trying to say."
51650,Some people will never accept that you're trying to be you.
51651,"Trust me, I know."
51652,You are awesome and totally valid and we love you.
51653,<3
51654,You look amazing!
51655,"I love it, perfect outfit and well put together."
51656,I like your style!
51657,You look INCREDIBLE.
51658,I just now noticed the sporran which is making me so happy!
51659,"I'm so sorry you have had to deal with such a nitpicking, critical voice while you're discovering these amazing joyful parts of yourself and your life."
51660,You're doing a fantastic job of taking care of yourself and standing up for yourself and that is even more to be proud of.
51661,But you shouldn't have to!
51662,"You should just be able to revel in the euphoria, and I hope you have more of that soon."
51663,♥
51664,Oh man honey you look so sweet.
51665,"Don’t let the incubator and sperm donor ruin your pride—you’re obviously doing really well and if they can’t see that, it’s their loss!!"
51666,I’m so sorry they don’t respect your happiness.
51667,You look absolutely beautiful!
51668,"Truly, an amazing look!"
51669,"As an adopted kid, I’m curious, how long have you known your bio mom?"
51670,"I met mine when I was 18 and all she cared about was how I made HER look, which is why I ask."
51671,She was so toxic I just cut ties.
51672,"But, if you’ve known her your whole life, that could be way more rough on you than it was for me, so, I don’t want to give advice out of turn here."
51673,“Even blind chicken sometimes find a kernel.” Brilliant.
51674,You look great.
51675,I’m sorry that your parents are not supportive.
51676,One very obvious difference between the text sent to you and the one you wrote…is your mom educated?
51677,Past grade school?
51678,Maybe English isn’t first language.
51679,"Your response is well thought out and spot on 
I digress."
51680,I think you look amazing!
51681,My grandmother raised me and worried about what the neighbors would think constantly.
51682,She made my aunt give up a baby because of what the neighbors would think.
51683,She wouldn’t let me go anywhere or do anything with friends because she was ashamed of me being fat.
51684,It took me years but I eventually figured out the neighbors don’t give a shit.
51685,They have their own problems.
51686,Just live your life and strive for your own happiness.
51687,"Your mom may never change, but that’s no reason for you to stop being who you are."
51688,Much love to you.
51689,<3  (BTW you look adorable :)
51690,"Sweetheart, you look amazing!"
51691,I love your bold sense of style!
51692,It makes me so happy you have started to find yourself and what makes you happy.
51693,I will always love and support you on your journey.
51694,I am proud of you!
51695,"Love, mom ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜"
51696,Gorgeous.
51697,Be yourself and be damn proud!
51698,Stand girl!
51699,"Sheesh sib, the way mum formed the sentences gave me a stroke."
51700,"Don't listen to her rambling, you are doing great Hun!"
51701,"God, dont even waste your time reading all that trash."
51702,"Hold tight to you, keep your sheilds up and hunker down till youre out of her house."
51703,I only skimmer the texts abd it seems like she wants to make it all about Her
51704,"Good grief honey, your bio mom needs to work on her own grammar skills before she starts trying to harp on your clothing choices =/

I'm sorry your mom doesn't get it."
51705,I think your outfit looks really fun and I'm glad you had a good time =)
51706,You are beautiful!
51707,"This mom accepts you exactly as you are, honey."
51708,If I can offer some advice?
51709,Your mom's writing seems like almost pure-play stream-of-consciousness random anxiety.
51710,My advice is not to engage with her.
51711,"She simply doesn't understand, she's afraid and worried about something she doesn't understand, and you just can't have a dialogue with someone in that state."
51712,Try to just disengage as much as possible.
51713,Put all your energy into your own self-actualization and exploring and discovering who you are.
51714,It will feel so much better and so much more powerful.
51715,"We all want, deep down, our mom to love us."
51716,"If it's any weird consolation, I feel like she does actually love you, she just literally is in a panic state and can't understand what's happening, and what I hope, for you, that this means, is that eventually she will be able to calm down and come to some kind of understanding."
51717,"It may take years--and do NOT wait for her--and it will only happen long after she realizes you ARE your true self and you're happy and strong-- but if it gives you any hope, down the line, that moment may come."
51718,"My mom and I were almost completely estranged for many many years, but in her last few years, we actually became close again and she was finally able to say that she appreciated me, or at least get close to that."
51719,It was such a gift.
51720,I wish the same for you.
51721,I can see both sides like channel.
51722,Your mother seems to worry and care for you which is a lot more than most have.
51723,"If you are set in choice & identity, she’ll come around I’m sure."
51724,"Be patient, she came from a different era."
51725,"People are shunned, maybe she’s worried that you’ll be harassed or about your safety in the community."
51726,Wish people would approach subjects with compassion and understating.
51727,She said you were gorgeous.
51728,"I think your mom is trying, try too or risk severing* the relationship."
51729,Best of luck to you
51730,Mama needs to learn how to spell before she comes after you god damn

51736,Had a stroke trying to read her message
51737,HARD AGREE!
51738,That makeup look is AMAZING!
51739,"Totally agree, you look awesome!"
51740,"As for your mum, can you exclude her from seeing your social media posts?"
51741,Then you won't have to have these interactions with someone who doesn't accept you.
51742,I came to the comments first: to tell OP that that skirt is awe-fucking-some and so are they!
51743,Second: As for any advice… u/shiralor has stated it quite nicely here.
51744,"I have dealt with a lot of criticism from a parent over choices I’ve made - not s. orientation or gender identity related, but still often rude and hurtful, and disengagement has made my days and mental health much better."
51745,"The person is on an information diet, and I only allow contact when I am in a place to do so."
51746,"Your life, your boundaries."
51747,"You are fabulous, and never let anyone convince you otherwise."
51748,"There is nothing I can say to make the sting of being told you need to be hidden away, but I will say that I am so sorry this was the result of your mothers words."
51749,"You look absolutely stunning, you are beautiful in every way shape and form."
51750,"You are you, and that is enough."
51751,"If your family cannot accept you as you are, you will find your own chosen family who will."
51752,"If nothing else, you have us here."
51753,We will always look out for you.
51754,Your mum's message gives a really confusing idea of what she thinks your gender identity is.
51755,"Just so we can be sure we don't do that here, and base pronouns entirely off clothes alone, would you mind sharing what your pronouns and your gender are?"
51756,"I have meet guys in heels and skirts,  women in shirts and non binary folk in either so I don't want to assume."
51757,"One way or another, your outfit is amazing, and I am super super proud of you for being true to yourself and stepping out into the lime light to show your beautiful self ❤️"
51758,"If you don't want to see people, then don't see them."
51759,Best thing I ever did for myself.
51760,You look great.
51761,Keep that confidence and self respect.
51762,♡
51763,Do NOT hide!
51764,Do NOT go backwards!
51765,"If your birth mother wants to see you, she can see YOU."
51766,"If she wants you to see the rest of the family, she needs to understand that you are who you are and will NOT change that to make her or your family more comfortable."
51767,"Because darling, Your Comfort MATTERS!!!!"

51774,You aren’t responsible for how others perceive or react to your existence.
51775,The fire cares not for what it burns.
51776,"Bi-sister here too, you work it!"
51777,You are looking fabulous and knocking it out of the park.
51778,I am so jealous how easy it looks for you to pull that outfit off.
51779,Way to go!
51780,"I read that book too, good suggestion!"
51781,"Really like the phrase you used, ""disengaged understanding"""
51782,Thank you for this suggestion.
51783,I’m in a complicated place with my own mother and have put a barrier over the last three years.
51784,Trying to navigate what that means going forward so this is helpful.
51785,I moved out of my parents' again a couple months ago but I still see them regularly :/ my dog is very attached to the family dog and I make plans on the weekend so she stays with them on weekends so she can let out her energy and play with him.
51786,So I see them way often than I'd like.
51787,"I'm also completely financially dependent on them, as they help with my rent and stuff"
51788,[removed]
51789,You know I didn't think of it and I still don't totally see it but I actually did a Ziggy look for Halloween last year!
51790,Actual Ziggy not Aladdin Sane.
51791,Thank you!
51792,She is a psychiatrist so it's hard with her.
51793,My entire childhood and adolescence she was in denial about me having mental health issues but now all she sees is problems with me.
51794,"Testosterone can make you lose hair on your head, which is why I'm prescribed finestride to reduce that but I haven't been taking it yet because I would like a more masculine hairline first."
51795,"I'm on low dose T so that the changes would be slow and gradual but certain things have been unavoidably noticeable like my voice changing, which I have absolutely been loving but to my parents it's an observable reminder that I'm doing something they don't agree with."
51796,I actually have rainbow shoe laces on the way!
51797,These laces are trans colors but they don't really stand out from far away.
51798,"To balance out the rainbow laces I got three fishnet tights, white, blue, and pink so my legs will be trans pride colored"
51799,Thank you!
51800,I need to get back into the process of getting a therapist.
51801,I lost my therapist of two years when my insurance changed from outgrowing my parents' and she became out of network.
51802,Then I changed jobs and haven't had insurance the last couple months.
51803,I just really hate the process of finding a  therapist >.> it took me so many to find the one I liked!
51804,"OP wins on the basis of coherence alone, I almost had a stroke trying to decipher what their mother was trying to say"
51805,Thank you so much and I wish your child the best this world has to offer.
51806,She actually hasn't even seen this photo.
51807,I unfriended my parents so I could post it.
51808,I cant block them because we primarily use messenger to communicate
51809,Thank you!
51810,Yeah I put a lot of thought into my look and I have mote tweaks I'll be doing for this weekend!
51811,Spencer's!
51812,Same with the shirt!
51813,Thank you it's from Spencer's!
51814,They asked me if they could use my image for marketing!
51815,But first I asked if I could be a Pride ambassador for them and now I'm waiting on an answer I don't know if I'll get
51816,"Thank you so much <3 
I'm not very good at taking care of myself at all actually."
51817,And I don't accept help from people.
51818,I barely eat.
51819,I snack throughout the day and usually have one meal.
51820,Maybe two but one is probably smaller.
51821,I somehow manage to get away with not showering up to a week sometimes if it's bad enough.
51822,And here is where I'm dependent on them too.
51823,I want to make plans but I have my emotional support dog and no friends who could help dogsit.
51824,"I already feel like I neglect her because I'm gone all day for work, at some point I take a nap, she has no interest in playing 95% of the time since we moved (today she fetched four times though, I'm very proud)."
51825,"So on the weekends I reunite her with the family dog, who brought her back from a depressive episode after the last family dog passed."
51826,"I don't know what I'm going to do in the future when they're inseparable, I can't live without her, my parents won't let me take him, I don't think I could take care of him and his needs, I don't know if I could afford it, but I'd miss him so much too."
51827,"I don't know my future, grad school, housing, nothing and I'm totally financially dependent on them"
51828,Right i was like omg 😂
51829,Thank you!
51830,"I would love nothing more than to have the knowledge, skill, and money to make outfits as flamboyant as my mind."
51831,I'd be in drag every day if it wasn't for time and energy.
51832,When I'm in drag that's probably my most authentic self
51833,Thank you!
51834,"They're Demonias and I changed out the laces to trans ones, though they read too much as white."
51835,I'm going to swap them out with rainbow laces and then balance it out with a trans pride color fishneta ensemble on my legs.
51836,It's gonna be a whole thing.
51837,New Rock and one other company I can't remember are more expensive but I've heard from many that they last longer and are of better quality.
51838,I do not wear these boots often enough to be able to attest to that
51839,Thank you!
51840,Yes every time I do my makeup I level up a bit and I see it through Facebook memories like one I got today.
51841,This weekend it's gonna get even better!
51842,Thank!
51843,Nah I know but it's comfy there and I can rest my arm on it.
51844,I see it more as a fanny pack lol.
51845,My HEMA friends hate me
51846,Omg you legit have the same experience!
51847,They do this about freaking everything.
51848,I wanted to see a chiropractor and they sent me articles about people getting strokes from them because of released blood clots.
51849,Dad kept heavily hinting that he knew I'm on T and he'd go on and on about how hormones give people cancer and whatnot.
51850,But it's hard to fear that just by the statistics.
51851,Every other lecture he'd say how one out of four people in this room will get cancer.
51852,"Then a few years ago they found that like 70% of cancers are just totally random, 20ish% and 10% genetics or environment/habits can't remember which is which."
51853,So if I'm going to get cancer anyway why the hell should I limit what brings me joy in this cursed life I never asked for?
51854,Thank you mum thank you for being here
51855,Oh 100%.
51856,I've mentioned it here and there on the comment section but my main obstacles are the dogs and finances
51857,Thank you they're Demonias!
51858,This gave me life thank you
51859,Sometimes I wish we could crowdfund for like a mansion or an island or something where we're allowed to be ourselves and feel safe
51860,I read the last sentence like Thor so you are Thorbro
51861,Skirt and shirt are from Spencer's and boots from Demonia!
51862,I went through countless therapists before I found one I liked.
51863,We worked together for two years but my mom didn't like her because she thought my therapist was being too much of a friend and she didn't like the things I'd started saying to her but I can't think of an example.
51864,"Insurance issues, insurance issues, new insurance, shes out of network, can't find therapists, on wait lists, change jobs, lose insurance for three months, get off wait lists."
51865,It's been a while since I've had therapy 😓
51866,Nah that's just how she texts especially when emotional.
51867,She just thought vomits into the phone.
51868,It gets worse when she starts switching languages and misspells in both and doesn't put in the accents
51869,Lmao I am actually slav so zdravo brate xD
51870,Omg I love Jeffrey!!
51871,I would love to be friends with them someday.
51872,It's a dream of mine to be a pioneer at the forefront of the modern gender movement.
51873,I just need the resources
51874,I had not heard of that one thank you for teaching me something!
51875,"Omg I first saw it sometime middle school age and in hindsight I think what I was feeling was ""what ever that is, that's my gender"""
51876,That's just because of the occasion.
51877,I've been very much struggling to take care of myself.
51878,"I might snack throughout the day and have oneish meal, maybe a second smaller one at some point."
51879,I can manage to get away with up to a week without showering thanks to baby wipes and deoderant.
51880,I said that the other day and my mom got super embarrassed hissing that people can hear.
51881,"I have three or four hampers of clean clothes I haven't put away in three going on four months and piles here and there so I've just been cycling the same five pairs of scrubs underwear for each day plus extra, pajamas, one or two casual outfits with a lazy dress on call."
51882,"I haven't brushed my teeth in a year, I haven't seen a dentist for twice as long."
51883,"I have had illnesses and injuries I have been unable to tell anyone due to stigma, I have made poor mistakes that I will defend with the fact that if I had the support of someone who thinks they are smarter than me and has more resources, I would have had access to better decisions."
51884,It's a hard knock life lol
51885,"I think it's that I have mental health issues, many of her patients with mental health issues are queer, now I've come out as queer."
51886,Add culture into the mix and you've got a mess
51887,Good metaphor.
51888,And if I stay locked in the freezer for too long I perish
51889,"Fairy festivals, ren faires, and HEMA baby"
51890,That was her rule too but I'm well past that age.
51891,Though I know she'd prefer nothing permanent while she's alive.
51892,But I've been learning to handle it
51893,It gers better and better with every look!
51894,"Shoes Demonias
Shirt and skirt Spencer's!"
51895,Thank you!!
51896,Happy cake day!
51897,"I sprinkled it here and there in the comments but basically English as a second language, highly educated but sloppy typing, gets worse when switching between languages, I guess also flustered when upset or something"
51898,I think it's the fury.
51899,Gotta go fast
51900,Skirt is Spencer's and boots are Demonias!
51901,Thank you so much!!!
51902,"Skirt and shirt are Spencer's 
Shoes from Demonia but I switched out the laces to trabs colors 
The pouch is called a sporran, common in celtic culture and usually worn with kilts at the front."
51903,I kind of treat it as a fanny pack and I can rest my arm on it and walk with swagger.
51904,"Perfect for just phone, card wallet, and cash."
51905,"I got mine at a fairy festival tenish years ago and no clue what vendor but you can usually find the sort at ren faires, fairy festivals, sometimes leather or kink events, anything regarding western martial arts."
51906,"Tl;dr it's a leather sporrun 

Hope this helps!"
51907,Homie Spencer's and Dempnia should be paying me for exposure xD
51908,"She has a history of blaming T. I have my bouts of irritability and that's been a thing for year but since finding out she'll say it's because of T. I've been sweating more and she blames the T, though I'm on meds that make you more sensitive to heat responses."
51909,I've been more impulsive lately but I think it's because I'm not dissociating as much but she doesn't like it so it's the T making me impulsive
51910,Have fun at your first pride!
51911,Free mom hugs are always appreciated
51912,Thank you!
51913,I am prescribed finestride to minimize hair loss on T but I actually would like a more masculine or square hairline first.
51914,I don't have a lot of forehead for my wigs' hairline lol.
51915,I don't see any bald spots and my friend said he didn't notice any when he saw me this weekend.
51916,I just cut my hair short and I have cowlicks here and there so maybe my scalp shows where they are?
51917,I have hella thick hair so I'm not overly worried.
51918,I'm also on low dose T
51919,Thank you so much!!
51920,"And I did put in a lot of thought, thank you for noticing."
51921,The skirt and shirt are from Spencer's actually!
51922,"You know what, it's not fucking negative to give people realistic, factual, science-based support and advice, which is what this comment does, while being validating and encouraging, without assuming anything about the OP."
51923,Anyone who thinks this comment is negative instead of informative and loving and actually important is the negative one.
51924,"It's our job as mom's to actually give our Ducklings real info, not just pacify them with pretty words."
51925,"Because then we would not be good mom's or ""mom's""."
51926,"While hormones carry the risks you are talking about here, it has been proven time and again that the absolute best treatment for gender dysphoria is transitioning."
51927,"I understand that you're erring on the side of caution, but from what I understand that is part of the process in acquiring hormones for this very purpose - at least where I'm from."
51928,You are explicitly and repeatedly told the risks from endocrinologists and it can take a while to get the wheels in motion.
51929,"And while those risks aren't ever going to completely go, it seems to be that they're outweighed by the risks of conversion therapy (not sure if I'm right in saying that what you're suggesting is specifically conversion therapy, but I can't think of any other interpretation given the info I have."
51930,"Here's some scientific literature which, to broadly summarise, suggest that transitioning is the best treatment for dysphoria, that transgender people who are socially accepted have mental health outcomes no worse than the general population, and that regret is not a significant factor post-transition:

And finally, [a meta-study by from Cornwell University's Public Policy Research Portal](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/) which overviews 56 pieces of primary scientific research on the matter."
51957,"Here is an excerpt:

**""We conducted a systematic literature review of all peer-reviewed articles published in English between 1991 and June 2017 that assess the effect of gender transition on transgender well-being."
51958,"We identified 55 studies that consist of primary research on this topic, of which 51 (93%) found that gender transition improves the overall well-being of transgender people, while 4 (7%) report mixed or null findings."
51959,We found no studies concluding that gender transition causes overall harm.
51960,"As an added resource, we separately include 17 additional studies that consist of literature reviews and practitioner guidelines."
51961,"This search found a robust international consensus in the peer-reviewed literature that gender transition, including medical treatments such as hormone therapy and surgeries, improves the overall well-being of transgender individuals."
51962,The literature also indicates that greater availability of medical and social support for gender transition contributes to better quality of life for those who identify as transgender.
51963,"""**"
51964,"Maybe that thier perceptions not being as ""real"" as they thought makes some people so defensive that they take much longer to accept that thats ok?"
51965,"Yeah, sorry, i didn't mean for it to come off as me being adopted, more so i wanted to denote that I don't really feel like they are parents in my heart because I feel closer to my friends and chosen family than my family by blood."
51966,If it weren't for money and the dogs Id cut my family off :/ My dog is an ESA and she's best friends with the family dog and they won't let me have him plus I don't think I'd be able to take care of both but I hate separating them.
51967,I bring my dog to their house every weekend so they can hang out together.
51968,And then of course money.
51969,I need them to pay for grad school (culturally parents pay for children's education) and they help with my rent and some extra financial help.
51970,"I wish I could win the lottery, give a chunk to them for their troubles and for what they spent on me, then just go on my way disappearing with both dogs."
51971,Yes she is an Eastern European immigrant and she's well educated (doctor) but when she texts she gets sloppy
51972,Yeah...if English is the first language.. that is drunk texting.
51973,"We all have our problems, but glad OP doesn't accept the projection!"
51974,"Yeah, English isn't her first language and she gets really sloppy when she types."
51975,"Makes it hard to follow, especially when she flops between languages mid sentence"
51976,"She gets really flustered when she's mad, which usually isn't to my face and she already is bad at typing."
51977,Combine that with English being her second or third language
51978,"I'm sorry, I must have mistaken this as a sub meant for seeking encouragement from moms when your own fails you."
51979,Oh wait
51980,Well I'm not a woman so.
51981,How do you know what I want to look like?
51982,"If it's gross to you but affirming to me, why would I care about your opinion?"
51983,Aw booboo what makes you think I'm straight
51984,"Tell me, what did you gain from posting that comment?"
51985,"Been there, decided against it."
51986,Guess you're stuck with me
51987,It’s total David Bowie vibes.
51988,I absolutely love it 🔥🔥
51989,This!
51990,I know others have said but I can't help it.
51991,Your make-up is amazing!
51992,A work of art!
51993,"Also, your wristlets (is that what they are called?)"
51994,"are super fun, too."
51995,She doesn't really understand my gender because we've never actually directly talked about it.
51996,"Any time my identity comes up its as an ""intervention"" or an argument."
51997,"I prefer they/them but she/her doesn't make me dysphoric, especially when I'm in drag."
51998,"I'm more euphoria driven than dysphoric, which is lucky."
51999,The main source of dysphoria is when I'm treated in some way that is exclusive to women and that the person would treat me different if I weren't a woman.
52000,"I wish I was born assigned male at birth and I've said since I was a teen that ""I wish I was born a man who dressed as a woman."""
52001,"I don't really feel like a binary guy, but the vibe of when a man is feminine is perceived differently than when a woman is feminine."
52002,My main goal is androgyny.
52003,"Lately people have been having a hard time pinpointing my assigned gender, especially given my voice lately, and that gives me loads of euphoria."
52004,So I'm on low dose T so that the changes are gradual and I can gauge what effect I'm liking or not.

52030,I wish I was the type of person that could afford those type of things XD
52031,I bet!
52032,Rock it out and keep being the beautiful person you were born to be!!!
52033,I love you!
52034,Seriously tho.
52035,My mom told me I’d get cancer from taking testosterone like m’am you don’t even know what you’re talking about
52036,"Fair, Sorry for assuming, I know some of the older generations are just Bad with texting, and switching between languages can definitely be confusing for someone like me who’s monolingual to read, thanks for informing me!"
52037,You still look absolutely awesome./gen
52038,?
52039,Yeah.
52040,"I sometimes wonder if society wasn't so fucked up, that we have had queer and trans folk around *forever."
52041,* Just now they feel safe enough to stand up and be who they are publicly.
52042,I wonder if people would be more understanding if we had been more accepting sooner?
52043,Maybe in the coming years it will just *be.
52044,"*

Personally speaking I don't spend a lot of time worrying about how people choose to live their lives."
52045,"I figured out when I was young that people who can't embrace who they are live miserable lives, so I set out to be as loving and accepting as I could, just loving what *is."
52046,* My son's gf is trans and I love her like my own daughter.
52047,"I have many other kids who aren't mine by birth, but I'm who they call if they need help."
52048,"So many people, including myself, have mental health issues."
52049,You're not alone.
52050,"You happen to be queer *and* have mental health issues.....one has little to nothing to do with the other, I am straight and have mental health issues."
52051,"I feel like the queer community is *so much better* at dealing with their mental health because they are so open about everything in life, including that."
52052,I have learned *so much* from my queer friends.
52053,I feel so fortunate to have them in my life.
52054,It may take time for your mom to understand.
52055,Hopefully she will eventually.
52056,One big thing I learned about life is that you can only love people for who they are.
52057,"You can ask them for what you want from them, but they sometimes can't give it."
52058,Human beings are so complicated.
52059,*But* you can control how you react and deal with her.
52060,"You are who you are meant to be, and that is *so very* courageous."
52061,If I was your mom I would be proud.
52062,I am proud and I'm not even your mom!
52063,Haha!
52064,"Well, know you have support here!"
52065,You look great and you’re old enough to manage your body as you see fit.
52066,"You’re the one that has to live in your skin so you always get the final say, no matter what your mom thinks!"
52067,That was certainly my first thought.
52068,I’m sure you’re very used to parsing it out.
52069,It's so silly!
52070,"It is SO much easier to brush off messages like these, bc they're barely legible!"
52071,Plus I cannot take that many run on sentences seriously.
52072,"I just wish ""fury"" in spoken voice was this easy to ignore lol!"
52073,"Anywho, I just want to add that I'm glad you are exactly who you are, and I wish you happiness and love and the freedom to always be your own person!"
52074,Hey real quick - what’re your pronouns?
52075,Wanna respond but wanna make sure it’s not dysphoria inducing
52076,I would guess she's just been reading about negatives of transitioning and is grasping for straws  to make you insecure and change your mind.
52077,"Not much reason to put stock in her evaluations, which I think you've already figured out"
52078,I love Spencer’s!
52079,I see a shopping trip in my very near future.
52080,Thanks for info!
52081,"It took me probably about a year and a half to accept that I am trans, and I came out one month ago."
52082,I have an appointment with an LGBT specialist clinic today to possibly start HRT which is amazing
52083,No apology necessary!
52084,"I get it now, and I totally get it, if this sentence makes sense."
52085,"You know you need to be you, and what a beautiful and amazing you you are!"
52086,"Unfortunately you’re tied to them, I know how that feels in a bad family situation."
52087,So stuck.
52088,But … there will be a light at the end of that tunnel.
52089,The way you handle her is so amazing.
52090,"Keep it up, keep it first class as you are, do your best (trust me, I know this is easier said than done) to not let her win by getting you to lose control and giving her the upper hand."
52091,"But, looks like you don’t need that advice."
52092,Wise beyond your years.
52093,"Hang in there, you’ll be free one day soon and be able to be at a refreshing distance"
52094,She may be well educated but it’s sad that she’s so lacking in empathy and so full of judgment.
52095,You’re her beautiful daughter and it’s sad she can’t see the obvious joy.
52096,True.
52097,Sorry I’m stupid.
52098,"So 'neither man or woman fits perfectly, androgyny with they pronouns fits best' might summarise it well?"
52099,Thank you for explaining!
52100,I think your goal of being hard to pinpoint you're achieving very well.
52101,"Your outfit really represents both, and I was asking because I really wasn't sure what your gender was - both kind of fit."
52102,It looks really cool!
52103,"You know yourself, what are triggers and what are euphoric!"
52104,Listen to your beautiful heart and you decide who you open your life up to.
52105,"No reason to explain to anyone unless you choose, so I'd say give your Mom,/family a time out."
52106,You do you!!!
52107,!
52108,You talking about euphoria vs dysphoria isn't something I've heard before today.
52109,Thank you for educating me.
52110,"Because of you, I'll be better next time."
52111,"When I see someone like you, someone super androgenous, it challenges all of my preconceived notions of male and female, and I love it."
52112,"And.... Now like a lot of parents, I've turned this into all about me."
52113,"You look amazing, btw."
52114,"You radiate confidence, and your style is impeccable."
52115,I have never heard of that!
52116,I don't have a great support system right now.
52117,I have friends i text but most of them live far away.
52118,I don't have any friends i hang out with regularly.
52119,I had a therapist but then I grew out of my parents' insurance and she became out of network.
52120,"I haven't had a therapist in the past few months because I was having trouble finding one, then I got a new job and my insurance doesn't kick in until next month."
52121,Financially idk.
52122,I'm making more money at this new job but with benefits being as expensive as they are (especially when you need the gold health plan) it's not that much higher than I was making before.
52123,"I don't know what more I can do to become financially independent, especially when I dopamine seek a lot via retail therapy."
52124,I actually lost all my savings during the pandemic because I was doing very poorly after a string od tragedies in 2020 and I used online shopping to cope so I screwed up there.
52125,My company is opening an office in Pittsburgh and I've indulged in the fantasy of moving.
52126,I have a lot of friends there who would help.
52127,"But I just moved to this new apartment and lease isn't up until October, money is still an issue as well as the dogs :/"
52128,What is up with these type of bot comments?
52129,"They seem to have gotten exponentially worse over the last 6 months or so, it's bizarre"
52130,A will do!
52131,Sometime this weekend at least on the Drag sub
52132,Oh I can't i have a horrible adhd problem and shop impulsively constantly.
52133,I blew all my savings during quarantine through retail therapy and dissociating or chasing any bloop of dopamine I could gather.
52134,"Even right now I have boxes and packages unopened that I ordered, insisting I needed them right now."
52135,I just checked Amazon to see what arrived today and I saw that apparently I bought the rice cooker I've been wanting and it arrived a few days ago??
52136,I really fucked myself over and now I'm stuck
52137,I mean I can't argue with him because he's an oncologist lol.
52138,But even if he's right the idea of dying as someone I'm not depresses me more than death itself.
52139,Yeah honestly when I saw the notification preview I was just gonna delete it lol.
52140,I don't know why I bothered reading it.
52141,"Thank you for your kind words, DragonBonerz"
52142,Aw that's sweet.
52143,They/she for the most part with preference to the former.
52144,"It's not a dysphoria thing, like she is neutral to me but they feels nice because it means people are trying and idk feels special"
52145,Good for you🙂
52146,"You're not stupid, I jumped on the defensive out of habit."
52147,It feels like every pride related post on social media is flooded with hate lately and it really wears on you.
52148,I'm on low dose T so that the changes are gradual and I can gauge what effects I want and if I like the process that's happening.
52149,My goal is to be more androgynous so my appearance looks genderly ambiguous
52150,Thanks so much!
52151,I really put a lot of thought into the outfit to balance out gender presentation.
52152,If I changed one thing I had to change others to balance things out.
52153,It was a mess lol.
52154,I always joke that my gender is whichever bathroom has the shortest line.
52155,Sometimes it's a porter potty
52156,No not at all I loved hearing your experience!
52157,And it's important to note that not everyone outside the binary looks androgynous.
52158,"You have girly men and you have butch women and then everything else in the four dimensions of gender (Kate Bornstein, fascinating stuff!)"
52159,But yeah definitely make no assumptions on gender!
52160,Phobes make it sound like we'll rip your head off if you slip up and that's not true.
52161,"For the most part, it might sting but we know you didn't know, we lay it out, and now we're good."
52162,You may make mistakes here and there but as long as you are well intentions and you handle being corrected properly (say thank you and move on).
52163,"The misgendering that sucks and is when people use it as an insult, as a slur, mock us for defending ourselves, turning every gender an insult whether you look like a man or you throw like a girl or what gender is it."
52164,"It's disgusting 

Sorry, went in a little rant there lol 

Thank you so much."
52165,"I don't feel confident often, only in these spaces and I wish I had them more often"
52166,Okay yes grey rocking is about to be your new best friend!
52167,"Grey or gray rocking is a variation on an information diet where you just reply simply, and then if you want add in topic change."
52168,You become Boring.
52169,"And you should ideally talk to a therapist about the strategy, because long term it's not the most fun, but for right now it's a tool in your arsenal."
52170,(Also seriously topic changes are POWERFUL.
52171,"They likely just want to talk about themselves anyway, so asking 'so hey what's up with your dogs/the garden/that politician you hate' is probably plenty to get them to stop insulting you half as much.)"
52172,"And the resources on r/raisedbynarcissists will likely be helpful, but as a heads up some are old, ableist, and even cishetnormative, but they still have some helpful gems in there."
52173,(Like Why Does He Do That?
52174,"by Lundy Bancroft is an excellent read if you haven't read it already, but wow is it meant for straight couples.)"
52175,Best of luck!
52176,Let me tell you from a doggo standpoint.
52177,"Your baby will miss their friend for a bit, but doggos can make new friends!"
52178,"I know it’s something you worry about, but lean on your pupper and let them lean on you, ok?"
52179,"Financially and with the rest, you do what you need to do."
52180,"If you need to deal with them still for a bit, that’s ok."
52181,Protect yourself and maybe look into the “gray rock” concept?
52182,And next month isn’t too far!
52183,Yay therapy!
52184,"I've noticed a lot of them lately, too."
52185,"I don't understand what the goal or point is lol

Edit- I can not type today 🙃"
52186,I feel that tho.
52187,Yeah my state never got quarantine and i only got 1600 from my state if i remember correctly 😅 i just kinda don't have a choice but to be careful bc I'm on my own and have been since i turned 18
52188,Any time :)
52189,"Okay I gotchu, friend!"
52190,Spencer’s is surprising.
52191,I didn’t know they had cute shit like this.
52192,"I thought it was still just dildos that probably aren’t body safe, cheap band shirts, and drug paraphernalia."
52193,The demonia boots on their website are all RAD I’m gonna have to check those out some more come pay day.
52194,"Fuck me, I should come out to my family."
52195,Like I know that they would respond well but even then it’s terrifying.
52196,I’m proud of you for being your true self despite having parents like this.
52197,This post might be the push I needed.
52198,"Thank you, friend."
52199,(They/he)
52200,Thanks!
52201,"I actually started on HRT, estrogen and then testosterone blockers."
52202,I'm excited.
52203,"I know in a lot of places there's like a year waiting list, but it was literally the same day I had my appointment that I started."
52204,I know people kind of rag on healthcare in America but this is great.
52205,It's a fantastic outfit and you rocket it.
52206,Your makeup skills are amazing.
52207,I'm sorry your mom isn't willing to even try to learn.
52208,Sending you mom hugs.
52209,"This comment made me think of that taco ad... the one where everybody was fighting about which kind of taco, and then the little girl asks ""why not both?"""
52210,- then everyone cheers!
52211,I feel like this could be a good quip whenever anyone gives you trouble.
52212,"Like... ask ""why not both?"""
52213,With a big smile and just face whatever emotion they want to bring with a big smile.
52214,"That way, you arent engaging their nonsense, you can just keep repeating it with a smile until they get tired of hearing it, or you can walk away and toss it over your shoulder like a badass."
52215,"It isn't giving an explanation, it isnt necessarily defining you, it is posing a question."
52216,Grey rock probably isn’t the best thing right now as they stated they are financially supported by family so unless they’re willing to give that up?
52217,Limited contact is probably the best solution for now until they can break free from the financial tie.
52218,Nah i couldn't do that to her again.
52219,When the last family dog passed away it shattered her.
52220,She's afraid of everything.
52221,She has verbal fear aggression.
52222,She's asserted herself as guard dog.
52223,Horrible separation anxiety and aw you should see how fucking cute they are together especially reunited.
52224,And he's so innocent I could never put him through that.
52225,And I don't know what I'd do without him either and dammit I'm welling up a bit I miss him and it's only been a couple days
52226,They repost comments with the hope of getting enough karma to be allowed to post on subs that block people without karma from posting.
52227,"Then they spam dropship scam links, or porn links, or advertising."
52228,Or the account is sold off to be used for those things.
52229,Absolutely and thank you as well!
52230,Nah Spencer's as long as I've known it has been what Hot Topic morphed into as they became competitors.
52231,Weird T shirts and crap.
52232,"The dildos and paraphernalia are in the back, at the border of which my friends would turn me around by the shoulders and walk me away."
52233,I didn't learn what was in the back of Spencer's stores until I went into on alone at like 20ish
52234,"Not disagreeing, more it's an option for their toolbelt?"
52235,And I feel like grey rocking doesn't have to be 100%?
52236,"More grey rock + Shiny Topic Change would be my strategy over pure grey rocking, some folks just want to talk and that sounds like the case here, which would at least reduce the hate during interactions."
52237,Oh honey!
52238,I didn’t mean to upset you!
52239,"Doggos are best, aren’t they?"
52240,Those are good friends lol.
52241,There’s a Spencer’s near my apartment (right across the mall from the hit topic obviously) I’m gonna go check it out some time this week.
52242,Will report back on my findings.
52243,No no you're good I don't emotionally feel much my body just kind of does for me.
52244,Like when I'm having an anxiety attack I might act calm but my body is vibrating and my heart is racing and I feel like I can't get enough air in my lungs
52245,Please and thank you!
52246,[deleted]
52247,Very very very happy for you!
52248,"You've accomplished so much, and hope you carry onwards"
52249,"Father here, that fucking rules."

52335,Yay!!
52336,"This is phenomenal news, I’m so proud of you!!"
52337,❤️
52338,Congrats baby!
52339,When I was younger my parents did the countdown to see how long I would last without cutting.
52340,The days added on and the pressure built and I did break my streak.
52341,Don’t be ashamed if you fall behind or you slip up.
52342,Just focus on being happy.
52343,It took me years to stop harming myself.
52344,Don’t put too much pressure on yourself.
52345,Patience comes with time and learning more about yourself and finding a good support group.
52346,Don’t be upset if you slip up.
52347,"Just take care of yourself baby 
Love you!"
52348,You’re doing so great tho!

52519,It's a struggle I can relate to 100%.
52520,You're doing amazing.
52521,Something I heard on the radio recently.
52522,"""There are things worth doing poorly""."
52523,We're always told to do things well.
52524,Stop putting so much pressure on yourself.
52525,"So whenever you're too tired to workout for 30 minutes today, work out for 10."
52526,"If you're depressed today and don't feel like being in the sunshine for an hour, sit out there for 10 minutes."
52527,There are things in life that are still worth doing even if it means not pushing yourself so hard to do everything well some days.
52528,Things worth doing are worth doing poorly.
52529,Find things that allow yourself a mental break.
52530,Don't ever give up.
52531,"This is fantastic, and here’s hoping you are feeling very empowered."
52532,"You are worthwhile, and this mom sends a giant hug."
52533,That is amazing!
52534,Congratulations on all your hard work!
52535,Keep it up one day at a time!

52772,Lol and you’re very welcome!
52773,"Like I said, I’ve been there."
52774,I’ve even had times where I had to reset my counter.
52775,But I had someone cheering me on and telling me that it’s okay to start back at zero.
52776,The only thing you’re not allowed to do is stop and give up on all your hard work.
52777,I’ll also try and remember to check in with you!
52778,it's from ginsbergs howl but yeah i guess it does fit hahaha.
52779,Oh i've had to reset plenty.
52780,"it's always always okay to get back up and start again <3 and it's never starting completely over either like if youre clean for 30 days, those days dont stop mattering when you relapse."
52781,This is so true.
52782,"I wish I wasn't as ""good""."
52783,"now I am just stuck in life not knowing what to do as no one is there to ""tell"" me."
52784,"Meanwhile, people around me that weren't as ""good"" are creative and bright."
52785,"Sometimes I just wonder if I was a ""defective"" one."
52786,"If not, why aren't I something better?"
52787,"Yeah, I know firsthand."
52788,"Always told I was “so quiet” and “so patient” because if I wasn’t, I’d either get verbally abused by good ol mom, or hit by good ol dad."
52789,"I remember crying because I was tired after swim practice, which I didn’t want to do, and still had a bunch of homework."
52790,"My mother woke up and yelled about how I was lazy and should’ve done the work sooner, and that I need to quiet the hell down."
52791,"I was 12 at the time, I believe."
52792,"I still don’t properly process emotions, and I probably won’t ever get there."
52793,It’s a big part of why I’m here.
52794,"If I can help some kid feel just a little bit better about life, not having to go through something scary alone?"
52795,I’ll try my best.
52796,I don’t want anyone else to be alone in their darkest time.
52797,Not so good.
52798,It’s 5am and I’m already awake but can’t get up.
52799,Everyday I feel worse than yesterday.
52800,"I have a friend whose parents found out she is no longer religious and the next day, they moved her to a religious country to ‘save’ her."
52801,"I’ve been working with the police the past few days, but she still loves her family and doesn’t want them to get in trouble despite everything they’ve done to her."
52802,So I’m just sad.
52803,And tired.
52804,"Always a quiet child, didn't cry much as a baby."
52805,Snapped around puberty when I didn't know what dysphoria was.
52806,Had a dark decade or two.
52807,Life has been spiraling out of control for a while but I'm trying to hang on.
52808,Birthing unit does not respect my boundaries or my gender identity and guilt trips me for not seeing her.
52809,I want so badly for her to see me for who I am but its been years and I don't know if that's possible.
52810,I am a vibrating ball of stress and emotions and I am dissociating while I write this.
52811,Some calm.
52812,Mostly anger and grief.
52813,"I hate having an effect on other people, I wish I could exist without anyone noticing me, but I know that's not possible."
52814,"(I am going to be okay, but I needed to vent)"
52815,I was one of those kids actually.
52816,"Had a ""great"" relationship with my mom until Almost 2.5 years ago when she kicked me out of her house because I was trans."
52817,"Now I have a job and live independently and tbh, thought I was over it."
52818,But last night I had a really crazy bad dream where she took me to a mental hospital and they tortured me.
52819,So now I'm sleepy and tired sitting in the office trying to cope with my thoughts.
52820,Edit: Grammatical mistakes.
52821,Add some details.
52822,Holy...shit.
52823,"I'm turning 50 this year, and this one post explains most of my life."
52824,Fuck me...🤯
52825,Saw my mom for the first time in a few months and she's trying to push me into a paralegal program again.
52826,I barely graduated with my undergraduate degree (yay depression and a degree I wasn't super into) and so law school is off the table so this is what she has wanted me to do for awhile now.
52827,And I always just shut down because as long as I can remember she's pushed me towards things I don't want to do but feel like I have to to make her happy or even get a hint of praise and I'm already miserable again.
52828,I was so happy in NY a few weeks ago and I'm just so frustrated again.
52829,I'm an adult.
52830,I should be able to do better.
52831,But I feel like a little kid begging for my mom to love me still.
52832,This is so true!
52833,"I was one of the ""good kids""."
52834,I'm almost 60 years old and still struggle to just be me and not seek validation from those around me.
52835,I spent the weekend crying because I miss the mum I should’ve had.
52836,"Not the mum I had, that I haven’t spoken to in two years."
52837,"I miss the supportive, loving, caring mum I needed."
52838,I miss my Nan who was that to me until she passed.
52839,"I’m so lonely, mama."
52840,This gave me chills on my lunch break because this was literally me growing up.
52841,I was extremely depressed and anxious with frequent panic attacks but I never told anyone because I had always been the good child and I didn’t want to be a problem.
52842,"I just want to go home, have an ice cream sandwich and watch cartoons."
52843,"Don’t worry mom, I’ll run some errands first and then get myself that ice cream sandwich."
52844,"My mother used to tell people that I was ""no trouble to anyone"" and it wasn't until my late thirties it occurred to me that I ought to have been at least a _little_ bit of trouble to her- trouble in the sense of effort, rather than being a nightmare"
52845,I was the good kid.
52846,Crippling anxiety has been a battle since I was 7.
52847,I have learned how to manage it for the most part.
52848,My son is also a good kid but I make sure to emphasize the kid part.
52849,He does not look after younger siblings or cousins.
52850,I set the expectation of acting like a five year old.
52851,(examples I can’t expect him to be good and quiet while I work from home for six hours.
52852,"But he is required to get dressed, put his shoes on and brush his teeth without any nagging or help)"
52853,"Hi mum,

I saw the title of this post and wrote out a whole chunk of text but then the picture loaded and I just can't seem to post it now."
52854,I'm glad you're finally checking in with me.
52855,It makes me hope you actually want to listen and take responsibility for your actions.
52856,"I was that kid, mum."
52857,I was the good kid.
52858,Praised for it by you and everyone else in the family while we were outside.
52859,"You would say things like ""you're such a good girl outside, shame about when we get in the house, you turn into a monster"" and then in the next breathe say ""you're a good kid really""."
52860,"I tried to be a good kid in the beginning, I really did."
52861,"Even now at 25, I just want to be a good kid deep down."
52862,But you never listened to me.
52863,You never listened to my thoughts and feelings about how you behaved.
52864,How gran behaved.
52865,How awful and toxic the family dynamic was.
52866,How I wanted to be treated the same way I tried to treat you.
52867,But you didn't want to listen.
52868,"It was all ""you have to earn respect"" and it seems like I'm always in the process of ""earning"" everybodies respect but never actually getting it fully."
52869,And then I gave up trying to be the good kid.
52870,"You lay into me enough times for being ""bad"" that I decided I would fulfill that prophecy."
52871,"Not in a really bad way, just in a way you don't like."
52872,I'm working on not being a doormat anymore mum.
52873,I'm working on myself with therapy and I think I'm finally getting somewhere.
52874,"I have an amazing, supportive partner who listens to me and isn't going anywhere."
52875,And I am reaching out/opening up to my friends more.
52876,"Plus, I have communities like this one if I ever need them."
52877,"I think you're proud of me, in you're own way."
52878,And in my own way I'm still that good kid.
52879,"I'm just trying to find who that kid is now, that's all."
52880,I love and miss you mumma.
52881,"I wish I could just pick up the phone and tell you all this, and technically I can, but I don't want to."
52882,You'd just see it as a personal attack anyway.
52883,"Thanks for checking in though, it means the world to me ❤"
52884,"Talking to my financial advisor today to figure out if there's any other way I can pay for college or get my student loans reinstated, or else I'll have to drop out of college."
52885,"So im scared, and I know the answer today won't be in my favor.. Im scared and sad and depressed and lonely."
52886,"I'm fine, I guess."
52887,"Just thinking about my parents are in that weird limbo of not being completely awful (ie hitting) where people around me would understand if I cut them off, but not completely good that I want them around in my life (don't respect my boundaries, make me feel like shit a lot, directly or otherwise, they do nothing to stop the lgbtphobia at my school so instead of talking to them about it I go to my supportive teacher), and how the fact that I'm trans would probably be something they would ""tolerate"" at best and send me to a conversion camp or kick me out over at worse."
52888,"It's insanely fun, having already middling parents, with bitterness added on, since they would see the fact that I'm trans as a choice."
52889,"Like, if only I could make them experience every minutia of pain I experience daily, would that make them think differently?"
52890,I felt this.
52891,"According to my mom I was such and easy going and happy toddler, I never cried or made a fuzz and then BOOM, anger issues, violent temper tantrums, anxiety and OCD by the age of 7."
52892,"Some years later it was still anxiety, OCD, social phobia, panic anxiety and chronic depression."
52893,It took me 27 years to figure out I had childhood trauma from emotional neglect and abuse.
52894,"Duckling here, I had a not so terrible day today compared to the past few days."
52895,Feeling a bit better.
52896,"Internet moms, how are you doing?"
52897,How's your day?
52898,And I am that good kid
52899,"This is why this good kid goes to therapy every week, takes a lot of anxiety medication and struggled with school work for many years 😖 

To all of you who need a mum for a minute who knows how much you just want to say please hug me I’m not actually okay; I’m right here when ever you need me!"
52900,Free hugs for all 💕
52901,Very true.
52902,The best way to survive my dad was to not bring attention to myself.
52903,"25 years later I’m in therapy, learning how to unblend from the background."
52904,I’ve needed a hug for a while.
52905,I was such a good kid growing up.
52906,Everyone commented about it.
52907,"As an adult, my mother used to call me when she was out shopping or something similar."
52908,She would loudly comment to me about how I was such a good kid unlike this brat in the checkout line that won’t stop screaming.
52909,I’m glad those calls stopped.
52910,I hate the passive aggressiveness.
52911,And her confidence that no one would call her out because she’s physically intimidating.
52912,"I was ""such a good child,"" and these days I'm like ""no, I was semi-verbal autistic and being bullied relentlessly."""
52913,"In good news, I just learned that my upcoming job has PAID BREAKS!"
52914,"Thankful for my husband, sister and her family, and uncle."
52915,Also missing my furkid (12-year-old tuxie cat) that we had to pts 2 1/2 weeks ago.
52916,He was misdiagnosed with a mass in his ear when he had an ear infection.
52917,"The ""mass"" went away, the symptoms continued, and we thought it was because of the mass (that we didn't know wasn't there anymore)."
52918,"He'd been sick since April, so his body was worn out from fighting and he had given up."
52919,We didn't find out there was no mass until his appt.
52920,to be pts.
52921,"I feel so guilty, even though I know we did the best we could with the information we were given by the other vet."
52922,"We did get an apology from the head vet at the place that misdiagnosed him (that vet didn't, but one of her employees did) and she said that she'd personally look into what happened."
52923,"We have 8 other cats, one of them being the littermate of the one we had to pts."
52924,It's so hard sometimes to look at her because she looks so much like him.
52925,"I just feel like there should've been more that we did, but we didn't know it wasn't the (nonexistent) mass so we didn't have him checked to see if that had gone down."
52926,"He was my ""heart cat,"" and we had him pts on the anniversary of my previous ""heart cat's"" death."
52927,"I wasnt ""good"" i was helpless."
52928,"I didnt like reading and i didnt dislike being outside, i was shoved into it and forced into 5-6 hours of sitting in the same place after school every night because schoolwork and results were more important than me."
52929,I dont want to be sedentary now but motivation to get up left me a long long time ago and even if we shake hands at times i just dont feel built to handle movement without pain
52930,I got engaged on Saturday to my best friend!
52931,❤️
52932,"Hi Mom, I could do with a cuddle."
52933,I started working for the NHS today after having to quit my medical degree 20 years ago due to ill health.
52934,I'm only admin but medical comes next!
52935,"I'm so tired though, it's such a big thing and I'm finally back to the real world after the pandemic, my first day's been exhausting."
52936,I'm stupidly anxious when I should be over the moon and home alone cos my partner's on late shifts.
52937,Didn't think finally getting here would be so tough!
52938,"I tried so hard, and it never seemed to be good enough."
52939,"Turns out my entire body was defective the entire time, and everything was tangibly more difficult for me because I wasn't made the same way as you were."
52940,"I couldn't do things the same way you did, but I made myself do them anyways because not doing them wasn't an option."
52941,"I made myself into someone who doesn't feel pain because so many things hurt all the time, and you never really seemed to care so obviously it wasn't a big deal."
52942,"I can't remember the last time I felt comfortable in my own skin, not aching and tired and distinctly aware of every bone shifting as I do things."
52943,"I thought I was morally defective, lazy and unmotivated and constantly complaining about everything."
52944,It's funny in hindsight when I know I barely even allowed myself to have emotions at all because your emotions were always bigger than mine.
52945,"Even now, you get upset and anxious about things that I didn't say, things that you only heard in your own head."
52946,I dont care if you don't do things or if you forget things or even if you are upset and can't manage it on your own.
52947,I just don't want you to yell at me anymore.
52948,"Or around me, even."
52949,Is that so much to ask?
52950,"Momma, I'm so tired."
52951,"There's just so much that I have to adjust to now, and it's gratifying to know that it wasn't my fault, but I'm also buried so deeply in grief."
52952,"Grief for who I used to be, for who I used to think I was."
52953,I thought I was crazy.
52954,I thought I deserved it.
52955,"I thought I was less than human, somehow, this ugly, selfish creature who didn't deserve nice things."
52956,"I can't take back the years I spent thinking these things, or get rid of the paths they wore in my brain overnight."
52957,"I cant go back and tell myself that it's okay, that it's not in my head, that there will be people who will care one day."
52958,"Even now, I can't say that I love myself, or even that I'm proud of myself."
52959,"I'm lukewarm about my existence, about who I am, which is so much better than the self hatred I used to bury myself in, but goddamn it's so hard to try to see myself through clear eyes, without hearing your voice when you said I was a bad student or a pessimist or that I wasn't trying hard enough."
52960,"I feel like it's all I can think about, partially because im reminded of it every time I move because every part of my body is involved."
52961,"It's this constant reminder that there is something wrong with me and there always has been, but you never noticed because you always assume the worst of me."
52962,"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this, but I just needed to put this somewhere."
52963,I really appreciate this forum and all that you guys do.
52964,I can't express how thankful I am for the responses I've gotten here when I was working through some of my worst moments.
52965,Thanks for checking in.
52966,I suppose I'm confused??
52967,So it's been 8 months since the breakup and since no-contact (I'm rather proud I haven't reached out!)
52968,and truthfully I'm doing really well!
52969,"I'm happy with my job, my life, and I'm (usually) really good at keeping up with self maintainence and personal responsibilties!"
52970,All of that and I can't stop feeling like I'm not suitable to be in a romantic relationship again.
52971,I feel as if no one would love me with all of my problems/insecurities (I'm strictly speaking about romantic love.
52972,I have awesome co-workers who very clearly love and care for each and everyone there).
52973,"If someone else had the same problems I have, I personally would be able to see past such things but I just can't imagine someone wanting to do the same for me."
52974,I just don't get it.
52975,Gah.
52976,I feel so broken in this way.
52977,I feel like I should just keep those parts hidden forever.
52978,"Anyways, I'm still trying my best."
52979,I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually
52980,My day feels like it's flying by.
52981,It's like every time I look at the clock it's 30 minutes later and I feel like I haven't done anything.
52982,It's been going better than recent days but I'm still stressed about stuff and emotional.
52983,Thanks for asking <3
52984,I just miss my friends.
52985,This is very true.
52986,"I’m 17 and moved out at 14, still have no idea how tf to ask for help."
52987,Dying
52988,[deleted]
52989,"Huh, I was so efficient from staying out of trouble when I was a kid and was praised for this."
52990,"Always reminded about how people will judge me for minor stuff on public, always shamed for being too childish or loud."
52991,"Now, I struggle with finding friends, job and leaving apartment at all."
52992,Everyone in my family wears a pukachu surprised face when I tell them that it's their fault that I am such an anxious and antisocial.
52993,"I try to reach out to my aunt, because she feels like someone who I might ask for being a mom for a minute, and she is very sweet and ready to help, but I don't know if my texts and calls are too frequent, because I am not used to keep contact with people at all."
52994,Oh shit.
52995,That's me.
52996,And now I have depression that I don't feel comfortable telling my family about.
52997,I have so much academic anxiety.
52998,I was a bad student as a child.
52999,Chaotic home.
53000,Couldn’t focus.
53001,Now I’m in my 20’s trying to discipline myself like a 7 year old into doing the simplest tasks.
53002,And it’s working.
53003,But I can’t tell anyone.
53004,It’s sucks majorly
53005,I am a 40 year old woman dealing with her aging infirm father right now.
53006,He is not who I am... Every racial slur and sexist remark kills my souls a tiny bit.
53007,You would never know.
53008,I read this and almost cried.
53009,Very true.
53010,"I have loving parents, but they almost never ask about how I’m doing."
53011,"I tell them sometimes, but they never keep up and always forget about my mental health, so I keep silent."
53012,"I’m also going back to college in a week, and it’s my senior year."
53013,"I’m so so scared, mom."
53014,"I know I’ll do great, and I will do my best every day."
53015,But I’m scared.
53016,I don’t want to let them down.
53017,Would you mind holding me and telling me things will be okay?
53018,I wish someone had explained this to my parents that’s for sure.
53019,"Not ok, I miss my best friend and had a dream about her

I was toxic and she needed to leave but yeah idk she pops up once in a while."
53020,"Im much better than before but sometimes I revert back to where I was when she left, it hurts"
53021,"Really badly, I could do with a hug :( I posted in this sub yesterday with the full version of what’s going on :( x"
53022,Working through this firsthand.
53023,"Since I never learned conflict management with people who are important to me, i either cant express my needs, try and have it come out passive agressive without meaning to, or explode and am unfair."
53024,Exploding and passive agressiveness just cirvles back to try and tell me I shouldnt bother expressing my needs cause ill just hurt people.
53025,"Working on wiggling through until I can do it well but hot damn, it sucks."
53026,I need to learn how to do this.
53027,Thank you so much for this!
53028,I needed to hear it.
53029,"All my life I tried to fit into what my parents wanted me to be, but instead I would just get frustrated and push back more when I got older."
53030,"I know they wanted what’s best for me, but it really hurt to push my passions aside to appease them."
53031,"They were proud of me after I finished college, got a job, decent boyfriend, etc… but I never felt more lost in my life."
53032,I started spiraling.
53033,But now I’m a mom and I’m trying to figure out who I am for my son.
53034,I have to remind myself to let go and grow.
53035,I’m breaking the cycle and will support my son in whatever his life path will take him.
53036,"In doing so, I’m learning more and more about myself."
53037,So thank you for this reminder!
53038,Thanks for posting this.
53039,I’m one of those kids.
53040,And now it brings me so much pain.
53041,I was raised by narcissistic mother who can’t accept that I’m grown up person and I’m focusing on my family now and finally defining my boundaries.
53042,And now I’m scapegoat and I’m trying to learn how to live with the fact that the person I loved and tried to please my whole life is not who I thought she was and never will give me the love I so desperately tried to deserve
53043,"Yeah always ""the good kid "" but in fact my anxiety a need to be good enough for people is here."
53044,And sometimes everything feel so pointless:((
53045,I swear the universe is telling me something.
53046,Just the other day I was thinking about this and spoke to friend about this too.
53047,Feeling directionless sucks ass.
53048,"I was definitely one of those kids, still am as an adult."
53049,"Therapy is going well thus far, but you can only do so much with an hour every/other week."
53050,I wish therapy could start with an all day session to bring them up to speed on all of the circumstances surrounding your desire to seek therapy.
53051,"Otherwise, I’m still struggling with mundane items I was never taught."
53052,Wish there was a rent-a-mom to ask those little things judgment free!
53053,I’ve been getting better about expressing what I want and need and have lately been treated as a problem child.
53054,That coping strategy got me through childhood though.
53055,Thank you for asking!
53056,My day has just begun and I'm having trouble getting out of bad despite needing to do important things.
53057,"I'm waiting impatiently on an email and have to keep reminding myself, ""the last time this happened, I couldn't wait and did x instead, which trends to be short sighted."
53058,"I got so upset and annoyed, and thought, If I had just waited!"""
53059,I'm trying to hang onto that.
53060,It's going alright.
53061,School started Wednesday last week so today starts the first full week where I don't have any kids around during the day for the first time in a little over a decade.
53062,I'm thankful that my husband had Wednesday off because I know I wouldn't have handled it well on my own.
53063,As much as I enjoy my space and the quiet I miss my kids.
53064,I'm so used to having at least one of the 3 home.
53065,Husband worked Thursday and Friday so it was too quiet.
53066,Did manage to get the living room pretty clean and was able to do my workout on time today so that's good.
53067,Haven't felt tears coming either.
53068,Also saw my dad for the first time in over a month yesterday.
53069,I usually see him at least once every week or two but our household had covid the middle of July followed immediately by my grandparents.
53070,My sister just had a baby so we all have to make sure we're either vaxxed or testing negative.
53071,"Man, I needed to read this today."
53072,Thank you.
53073,"Today's been a pretty shitty day, but im doing the small things to try and make it better."
53074,"It's been hard, especially when a lot of little things make me cry, but I took a walk earlier, and now I've been chilling with the teddy bear my husband bought for me and playing videogames with a friend who's super understanding if I need to take a break."
53075,"Wish I could call my mom and just say hi, but she'd probably just hang up on me like she usually does and thus set off more crying, or tell me I'm being stupid for crying...
Making all the preparations I can for tomorrow to be a better one."
53076,"Today's been a pretty shitty day, but im doing the small things to try and make it better."
53077,"It's been hard, especially when a lot of little things make me cry, but I took a walk earlier, and now I've been chilling with the teddy bear my husband bought for me and playing videogames with a friend who's super understanding if I need to take a break."
53078,"Wish I could call my mom and just say hi, but she'd probably just hang up on me like she usually does and thus set off more crying, or tell me I'm being stupid for crying...
Making all the preparations I can for tomorrow to be a better one."
53079,My cars transmission just went out.
53080,I can afford a car but don't have the credit to get one.
53081,I'm currently borrowing moms car but she needs it back soon.
53082,Definitely feeling like its going to end up bad.
53083,Mine is an introvert.
53084,"I understood this at a very young age, I got mad when people would try to force her to come out of her shell or into large group situations."
53085,"We did daily check ins, she’s 22, we still do this."
53086,And she texts any time she gets frustrated and I reply with things to calm her social anxiety.
53087,Ha ha ha this hits way to close and hits hard.
53088,I'm stressed out and annoyed.
53089,And I kinda wish I could be open with my bio parent.
53090,Thank you for this.
53091,"It’s 6:30am where I am, I keep waking up early feeling nauseous and I don’t know why."
53092,"I’m not pregnant, don’t worry."
53093,I have a lot of assignments due soon for uni and it’s stressing me out; my days have been very busy lately and I haven’t really had time to just sit down and get the work done.
53094,"This afternoon’s clear in my schedule after a class so I’m going to make some tea, put on my lofi, and dive in."
53095,And!
53096,My abusive roommate is moving out in the next few days.
53097,"I’m really excited for this, I’ve been living in a constant state of anxiety for the last few months."
53098,"Every time I walk up to my apartment I feel my heartbeat go way up, I get nauseous and panicky and such a strong feeling of dread."
53099,It’ll be nice to not have to feel that way any more.
53100,I’ve been putting time into ‘reclaiming my space’; he provided a fair chunk of the communal furniture so I’ve been replacing it even though he hasn’t finished removing his yet.
53101,"I bought a new side table with a lamp for the hallway, and a new coffee table."
53102,"I also got a new towel hook, blue bathmat, and blue doormat."
53103,"They’re little things, but they make me so happy."
53104,"Everything’s in blue and white and light wood tones, which are just so beautiful to me."
53105,All my roommate’s furniture is black.
53106,Last night one of my amazing friends helped me pick up a free couch + armchair I found on Facebook.
53107,"He helped me carry them up to the third floor, because he’s awesome, and the whole thing only cost me buying him a burrito as thanks."
53108,"The couches are beautiful, really soft and squishy, and I’ve got the armchair set up in the corner by the window to make a little reading nook."
53109,"Once my roommate gets his couch out, the space will be perfect."
53110,"I’ve decided to live on my own for a month or two so I can enjoy the company of myself and my cat, and so I can stop flinching every time I hear a sound like keys jingling."
53111,The only other complication is that my lease is ending soon and I’m scared the landlord won’t renew because I have a cat.
53112,I have to tell them about her because my roommate’s threatened to tell them anyway.
53113,"I’ve moved five times since the start of 2020, I really don’t want to have to do it again."
53114,Especially not in the middle of my final exams.
53115,"Thanks to anyone who read all this, it’s been nice to write it down and get all the thoughts straight."
53116,"No matter what happens, I know things will be okay with time."
53117,ETA: I was definitely not one of the ‘good’ kids 😈 I was a little gremlin child and will continue to be for many years.
53118,I’m a redhead *and* a Scorpio.
53119,The world will come to fear me.
53120,This is so true.
53121,I was a good kid until trauma responses kicked in.
53122,"And I was constantly trying to get back to ""good kid"" status."
53123,"My dad (who literally used his job as a flight attendant to smuggle weed in the 60s/70s) says I was his worst kid because I had undiagnosed ADHD, then the trauma from sexual assault and then my mom died at 14."
53124,"It was..  .not fun


Today is a pretty good day Mom."
53125,"Work hasn't been bad, I had an appointment that went ok, and made lunch with my guy."
53126,It's been great so far.
53127,"Hope you're doing well too, mom."
53128,Miss you.
53129,Hiya momma ducks!
53130,Not doing too great over here.
53131,"Graduated with honours but I can’t find a job, and my own mom moved to France for work but is so overworked I don’t want to burden her."
53132,"I’m thinking of moving over there with my boyfriend to help her out, which is very exciting but also very scary!"
53133,And then last week we found out two of my grandparents have cancer.
53134,My grandmother has only weeks to live and I just lost my other grandmother to cancer back in March and I just can’t.
53135,Its too much.
53136,I want everyone to stop dying and I want everything to not change.
53137,"I’m almost 30 now and I feel like I should be able to deal with this, but all I want to do is hide in my bed."
53138,But I can’t.
53139,"My cats and boyfriend need me too so O get up everyday and do everything I need to do but jeez, I’m so tired of everything always hurting all the time."
53140,Just reading all these stories made me bawl.
53141,"Hey Momma Ducks, I'm kinda mixed on how I'm doing."
53142,"I lost my job, and while I liked a lot about my job and the steady money was good, it didn't pay nearly enough and I'm so introverted that even just taking care of one person was too much for me a lot of the time."
53143,"My YouTube channel started growing fast at the same time and I've joined an awesome community around that kind of content, but I'm making a lot more content and pressuring myself because I don't want to disappoint my supporters."
53144,"And I started trying out a food delivery thing to make some money while I get the YouTube thing going, but it's so new and different and I have this mix of excitement and anxiety because it seems like it CAN be a good thing, even if I do live on the edge of nowhere so I can't use a lot of the advice for making really good money, but it's a real struggle here getting started."
53145,"And I'm always busy with not enough mental health time, and I have both scheduling and introvert and social anxiety issues so I can't see my friends, and I haven't had an in-person hug or anything like that in over a month and I'm scared I'm going to end up like I was when hugs and things only happened a couple times a year."
53146,"And after writing all that, I feel like I'm not doing so well."
53147,I'm really stressed and lonely and I wish my mom were still alive so I could hug her and tell her about my bad days.
53148,"&#x200B;

I hope you're doing well, Momma Ducks, and my fellow ducklings as well."
53149,"Thanks for the space to vent, I really appreciate it."
53150,Now to drink some tea and put on a happy face for recording time.
53151,I was told the opposite.
53152,That I was such a difficult child.
53153,"When I talk about things I did or got in trouble for, people say mostly I was normal, that that's what kid's do & that my parents were lucky because they & their siblings would do worse (even most other only children told me they were worse & even when I say worse I'm not even talking all that bad for the most part)."
53154,"I’m 16 and I have 4 parents, somehow I got the good stepparents and the bad original ones."
53155,I was a good kid.
53156,I taught myself how to shave because no one volunteered to teach me and I didn’t have the nerve to bother anyone to ask.
53157,The other day my stepmom sat down and asked me what razor I wanted her to get.
53158,"I told her, “I didn’t know” because I didn’t, no one had ever asked me."
53159,My mom got me a small pack almost 2 years ago and I had used them sparingly.
53160,"She asked what soap, shampoo, and conditioner I wanted (those I did know)."
53161,"For the first time in my entire 16 years, for the first time with any of my 4 parents… someone had gone out of their way to say, “hey, I’m *going* to be getting these for you, what would you prefer”."
53162,I went upstairs and smiled the biggest grin of my life because someone looked out for me.
53163,"Mom I don’t think I’m ok, there is so much in my head that I’ve pushed down over the past year."
53164,After I let it all out to you about my mental state you told my dad and he didn’t believe that I was telling the truth.
53165,I’ve pretended to be ok for so much of my life that now people don’t believe I could ever be struggling.
53166,Mom I think I’ve pretended so well I don’t even know how bad it is myself.
53167,"Mom I’m sorry I’ve hidden this from you, please forgive me"
53168,Well I was a good kid until I was everyone’s lucky bag when they were upset or angry.
53169,"I used to suck it up and cry when I was alone and then after a massive car accident and an abusive relationship I changed and I got a backbone and suddenly I got the “you used to be so good what happened?” 
I started standing up for myself and saw I was worth more than that, that’s what happened."
53170,Still feel sad and angry about everything though and I can’t put it behind me yet.
53171,From May to July have been the worst months for me.
53172,With August starting things are starting to get better.
53173,Just wish we could have more food around but I don't want to complain too much.
53174,I'm just happy to have our utilities back on.
53175,"I'm doing good, thanks Internet Moms."
53176,"I played a fun 2,660 Points Onslaught Match of Warhammer 40k yesterday and had fun even though I lost by a LOT of Victory Points."
53177,I hope everyone else had a fun weekend.
53178,Thank you moms for checking in.
53179,I'm having such a hard time finding the middle ground.
53180,"My kiddo needs me, my Husband needs me, everyone needs something from me."
53181,"Growing up I would have just taken care of everyone else to ""be a good girl"" which is all my actual parents taught me, to serve all their needs."
53182,"Yet now I know I have needs and I do a much better job of taking care of me, but it still feels wrong."
53183,"I still feel guilty putting myself first, when needed."
53184,"I still get so resentful and angry that I have to unlearn all of this junk they taught me; like I want someone to fully care for all my needs for once, you know?"
53185,My Husband is great but it is more like our needs aren't aligning at times now so it adds a layer (sometimes he needs emotional support but I'm zapped and vice versa).
53186,"I'm trying to build a support system, I'm in therapy, I know I'm doing well keeping this generational junk from affecting my kid, but some days I feel like I'm drowning still figuring this all out."
53187,Anyways thanks again for checking in today moms.
53188,It means more than you know today 🖤
53189,I applied for a job.
53190,Yup me because anything else then quiet and no trouble was met with verbal abuse.
53191,Couldn't make normal mistakes because I was called stupid and told that nobody would love me.
53192,Made mistakes as a teen im secret and got myself into dangerous situations because I had nobody to turn to.
53193,Stopped the bs of trying to please the egg donnor 8 years ago went very vvvvlllc with her and I don't need her approval.
53194,My anger and grief over a mum I should have had turned into indifference about her as in I dont care what happens to her I truly don't thats her problem to figure out just like I had to for so many years.
53195,"Recently my mom told me that she remembers the young me who had it all together, who was quiet and calm and happy, hard working, over achieving."
53196,"She said she knows that if I try hard enough, I can take the current me - now diagnosed with ADHD and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - who is burnt out, unemployed, whose side ventures keep failing..."
53197,I can 'marry' the two together.
53198,She never did see me.
53199,I started self harming at 12.
53200,My brother terrorized my my entire childhood.
53201,"I was constantly contemplating suicide as a last resort out, though I never tried."
53202,"I've been trying to work up the courage to post some old diary entries here, because I recently learned sibling abuse is a thing?"
53203,"And I kinda want to know if what my brother did counts, I guess, because whenever I went to my mom crying as a kid she would reply ""sort it out yourself"" even though I was there because I COULDN'T."
53204,I guess it doesn't matter now.
53205,Sorry for the rant 💚
53206,That post made me sad and got me thinking about my childhood.
53207,"My biological father always said ""your brothers were always so exhausting, always having trouble in school."
53208,"But you weren't, you were the ""Selbstläufer""*-child so I didn't have to take care of you"" 

To explain, ""Selbstläufer"" is german, literally translates to ""self-runner"" and google translates it to ""self-perpetuating""."
53209,It means when a project or plan is so good that it will definitely be a success without putting much work in it.
53210,This word isn't typically used for humans and as an adult I think its horrible to say that to a child.
53211,"Also looking at myself now: depression, generalised anxiety disorder, anger issues, people pleaser, cant set boundaries and the list goes on and on."
53212,And its not like my brothers feel any better than me.
53213,bad today i just sad about not having my parents more it hard wake up without having they in my life.
53214,But also sad about that my life so changed got i miss how used to be and all I losed did
53215,I can't even remember if I was such a kid.
53216,"I know I probably cried sometimes in front of my parents, but the most vivid memory I have of crying in front of my mom was when I was..."
53217,I think 13?
53218,Couldn't be older than 15 though.
53219,My dad helped me clean up my bunnies cage in the garage.
53220,"It was dark outside, cold, I was exhausted and had a headache."
53221,"I think he breated me a lot and was mad at me for taking so long and doing some things wrong, I don't remember."
53222,I know he seemed mad and strict at that moment.
53223,"When I came back in, my mom asked if everything was alright, and I just bursted into tears."
53224,"I never talked to them about my problems as a teenager (when I could prevent it), so this just felt really embarassing."
53225,As If I was weak and shouldn't act like that.
53226,"My mom is always really sweet when I show emotions (which was twice, this one time included), so I'm not sure why I don't want to show them to my parents."
53227,"My father is a good man, very funny and open, but used to get mad quickly."
53228,"He'd understand too, but I have never really talked about emotional things with him."
53229,"I think I just learned to not show my emotions out of several small reasons... it's difficult to dissect my past and present family problems and pinpoint what exactly caused what, cause it was a lot of subtle things and just not actively caring enough."
53230,I just know that I avoid talking about emotional topics with them.
53231,I'm working on some further education programm at the moment.
53232,"The stuff is great, I'm super into it."
53233,But I just cant come up with the motivation to work on my lectures right now.
53234,"I feel lazy and I'm afraid I'll fall behind, yet I can't get my butt up."
53235,Ugh...
53236,"Hi, yes, thanks for this post."
53237,"My boyfriend sometimes gets so frustrated by how accomodating I am, because he worries I ignore my own needs."
53238,At least I picked a good one
53239,I'm in a whirlwind of gender confusion... again.
53240,I keep think it's settled and then it isn't.
53241,"I'm too old to be dealing with this, and I don't **want** to deal with it either."
53242,"I want to just be a girl, and if I transitioned I would miss being a girl anyways... what I want just isn't possible."
53243,"I always want both options of everything- I'm not greedy, I just appreciate both sides."
53244,"My day hasn’t been well, I’ve been butting heads with my actual mum and it just sent me into a mental breakdown"
53245,I was the good kid.
53246,The easy kid.
53247,The kid who didn’t need anything.
53248,The only real praise I got was if I achieved perfection.
53249,Anything less got no reaction.
53250,"(I had a good childhood, but many younger siblings- some of whom were not as well behaved and took a lot of my parents’ energy)."
53251,So being perfect and having no needs became my identity.
53252,It carried on as I started my career.
53253,"And in the end it nearly killed me- I gave everything I had, til there was nothing left, and still they wanted more."
53254,Every aspect of my life just kind of collapsed when I hit my breaking point.
53255,I didn’t even REALIZE this until I was in therapy after my breakdown.
53256,"The pieces suddenly fell into place, explained so much about me."
53257,My parents don’t know- I don’t need them having guilt over them doing the best they could.
53258,"Check on your good kids, people."
53259,They need you too.
53260,"I was a ""gifted kid"" which meant I had no motivation to be better, but I also always and still worry that I'm doing the wrong thing, whatever it is and I'm basically a nervous wreck, I can't drive because I'm afraid I'll hurt or kill someone or myself."
53261,"A lot of the stress I had has gone down a little bit since I came out as trans, and I'm working towards becoming the woman I've always been but it's hard, and it's going to take a long time."
53262,"I went to the state fair yesterday and I wore a pink shirt under a blue hoodie because it's the colors of the transgender pride flag 🏳️‍⚧️ and a pin on my hat that says ""She/Her"" and I introduced myself to people I've never met as Gloria."
53263,"I was mainly nervous because if someone did recognize those colors and didn't like trans people because of the myths and rumors they've heard about trans people they might try and confront me, and I'm already dealing with a lot."
53264,"It did feel really good to go as my genuine self, but I definitely do need to find a way to do some kind of therapy because I have a doctor to help with my body stuff but I don't have a doctor for my mind stuff."
53265,"I've started trying a dating app but that's a whole other thing because I don't even know my sexuality, and I've only ever told one person in my life about being sexually assaulted."
53266,It'll be probably at least three or four months before my hair starts to grow back if it does at all even with medication so that's a part of me I feel like I need to hide.
53267,And shaving my face every day or other day is awful.
53268,"I also feel like my mom feels responsible for making me cut my hair years ago, I had long hair and when I started to go bald at the age of 18 or so I buzzed it all off."
53269,"I don't think she could have known that I was trans, or maybe I ""didn't show any signs"" because if I did then maybe there would be something ""wrong"" with me."
53270,"I've been on HRT for 54 days and even looking back at pictures from April there is a noticeable change to my face, and also my chest has just started developing, which is crazy."
53271,I know I am going to be uneven because the right side started about two weeks before the left but maybe TMI I have an actually palmable amount of booba.
53272,"I feel like I'm a broken mess, but it's hard to work on myself when my whole life it's been ""oh I'm so worthless"" it's way easier to be miserable and get blackout drunk every night."
53273,"I am almost four years sober, coincidentally that was the last time I tried to un-life myself, and that led to research online like ""Why does my existence feel wrong?"""
53274,And I learned about something called gender dysphoria.
53275,I’m in this picture and I don’t like it dot jpeg.
53276,Wow I never realized it but I was (and really still am) one of those kids.
53277,"I don’t really know what else to say… I probably shouldn’t get into the details, but thank you for posting this"
53278,I think I just read something that might explain my issues.
53279,I think I need to lie down.
53280,[removed]
53281,I'm struggling really badly but I'm hanging in there.
53282,On the plus side I've just bought new stationary so yay
53283,Not good.
53284,I’ve been in a depressive episode the last few days.
53285,I was the “good kid”.
53286,I was the “mature kid”.
53287,I was the “patient kid”.
53288,I wasn’t any of those.
53289,I was just dealing with anxiety and depression since the 4th grade.
53290,"I learned early on that expressing emotion just got me in trouble, so I stopped showing emotions."
53291,The I get called heartless because I don’t express any emotions.
53292,Now I’m in a job that I hate and have no clue what to do.
53293,"I can’t transition yet, because I’m still stuck with my shitty family."
53294,I feel trapped with no way out.
53295,I’m not even 25 and I’m already burnt out.
53296,"All signs are telling me now is a good time in my life, so I should be happy and enjoy it."
53297,But the bad times took too much out of me.
53298,"I wish I could just be dead for a year, instead of wasting my life like this."
53299,"When we were growing up, we had a lot of housing insecurity, Mom."
53300,Remember the fire and how we stayed in the hotel and shelter?
53301,"Then when you were in court over property damage, I was helping move the burned out house by myself."
53302,"I was 10, remember?"
53303,It was the best way I could help you.
53304,"After that, you had to declare bankruptcy and we had to make do with terrible landlords."
53305,I remember us running away from one place because you were about the get evicted but we needed to move before it was served.
53306,And then that really awful lady landlord.
53307,She served us a 5 day notice while she knew you were in the hospital in a coma from the heart surgery that went wrong.
53308,I went to all the social workers to stop the eviction process.
53309,"I was a teen and I really don’t know how I did it, looking back."
53310,"Well, this morning there was a maintenance man in the hall of my apartment building."
53311,He’s known for being pretty mean.
53312,I got triggered and started panicking.
53313,I don’t ever quite feel secure in any home.
53314,I often feel like eventually someone is going to walk in and order me to get out.
53315,Change the locks.
53316,And it be all my fault.
53317,Some times the anxiety is triggered just by seeing a maintenance repair van outside.
53318,I wish I didn’t feel like this.
53319,"I almost feel worse than when those things were actually happening to us, because I had a way to help."
53320,Now I just get debilitating anxiety.
53321,I don’t want you to think this is your fault.
53322,This isn’t your fault at all.
53323,Feeling broke as I apply to housing :/
53324,This is true.
53325,I was the good child trying to avoid notice.
53326,"Being noticed usually meant being yelled and cussed at, or hit and yanked around."
53327,I was ridiculed and mocked for crying or being mad.
53328,"I’m almost 60, and still have trouble speaking up and letting people close."
53329,I have to be pushed until I’m super angry before I can confront someone who has ignored my boundaries.
53330,I made sure my kids felt they could ask questions and be sad or angry when they felt those emotions.
53331,It’s not normal for a child to be silent and slinking around the corners of the rooms to escape notice.
53332,"But just ask my parents, I was a GOOD kid…"
53333,"I’m doing better in a lot of ways, but I still struggle to communicate my feelings and ask for help."
53334,I have been going to therapy and working really hard at getting better but somedays I feel discouraged because I’m not yet the person I want to be.
53335,"I’m so tired, Mom."
53336,"Sometimes I tell you about the stuff going on in my life, but I always end those rants with “but it’s okay” because I don’t want you to worry much, because I’m the “good kid”…But right now, if I’m being completely honest, it isn’t okay."
53337,"Nothing feels okay anymore, and the most horrible, guilt inducing thing is that I constantly think “but it would be so much easier if you gave me that money you promised me so long ago…” And I know you really needed to go on that trip you dreamt about for so long, and I know you needed to buy the trailer to do it, and I know and I know…But watching you and Sister live so peacefully, the lives you dreamed of, while I sit in my stuffy rental wondering when it’ll be my turn…It’s hard, because I know I’d be so much closer, life would be so much easier…

I will never ask."
53338,I’ll never bring it up.
53339,"It’s been 4 years though, and I think about it every single day- about how much easier my life would be."
53340,"I’m so tired of living this life, Mom."
53341,I wasn’t built for this…
53342,"Hi Moms, 

I'm not good."
53343,"I just started therapy because I feel really hopeless, and the mom who gave birth to me, I don't talk to her any more."
53344,"Really, when I was a kid we didn't 'talk': she gave orders and if I didn't do them well enough, I got reprimanded."
53345,"I guess, I'm mourning that I don't have a mom and I want one."
53346,"I'm hurt because I'm not good enough for the mom I have, and honestly...sometimes I just need a hug and to be told, 'it'll be ok' and I'm not gonna have that."
53347,It hurts.
53348,A lot.
53349,I’ve been a bit of a wreck lately.
53350,"I’m young and still live at home, so this post hit home well, especially because of current family drama that has me torn between parents wishes."
53351,"Such drama is rare in my family, and instead of choosing one or the other I’m trying to get the courage to stand up for myself and set proper boundaries for once with my infuriating siblings (who started this drama) and my parents instead of trying to be their little peacekeeper for once."
53352,But it’s got me on the verge of panic attacks almost every day.
53353,"Simultaneously, I’m super anxious and trying to convince myself to listen to my therapist and psychiatrist and finally pick up the anxiety meds I’ve been prescribed."
53354,"But i was raised by people who think psych meds will kill you, and I’m terrified to try…"
53355,I'm in the thick of a depression that's occurred on and off throughout life exactly because of this.
53356,"I was a really good kid, an old soul, wise for my years."
53357,"The very few times I slipped up as a teen, I was punished disproportionately compared to the ways my siblings were punished for their mistakes."
53358,"The same mother who bragged about how she bought my oldest brother a 6-pack for his grad party, grounded me for a month because I was an hour late home from a friend's house."
53359,I almost didn't even get to go to my grad party.
53360,"I'm finally starting to voice my needs to my mother, and it caused her to shut down on me, because she can't understand why I wanted to talk about the past."
53361,I barely talk to her now.
53362,Sounds like the phone call I had with my mom yesterday.
53363,It’s been 2 months I haven’t really talk to her since she doesn’t call and blame it on me.
53364,"I’ve been busy with a massage therapy course, and trying to practice and launch a small business at the same time."
53365,"She never checked on me, I graduated and didn’t call ( surprisingly my dad did follow me through this process ) to congratulate me and it pisses me off."
53366,So today I crashed when I was supposed to work on building my business and felt like a fraud again …
53367,I.. wasn’t a very “good” child.
53368,"I wanted to follow the rules, and I hated being in trouble.. but I was very overemotional."
53369,"I was terrified of new experiences, new foods, new people, new places."
53370,"I hated the way clothes felt most of the time, and would shriek if I was forced to wear socks or pants where I could feel the pockets or the seams."
53371,"I couldn’t stand being touched, but what child has the ability to calmly say “please no hugs today”?"
53372,"And further still, what child is *respected* when they say these things?"
53373,"I never made friends easily, and social interactions were a minefield of things I didn’t understand."
53374,"A lot of times, I would get halfway through a conversation and realize I was being laughed at.. and not with."
53375,I was the butt of so many jokes.
53376,"I was the chubby, happy, over-enthusiastic girl who wouldn’t pick up on it when what you said was really veiled insults."
53377,"—

Lately, I’m *mad*."
53378,How not *one* of my parents or teachers thought to have me tested for ASD is beyond my fucking understanding.
53379,"I am 38 goddamn years old and just now putting the pieces together of why I hate being touched, why too many loud sounds send me into meltdowns, why I shutdown and cry into my stuffed animals in times of stress, why I can’t hold a job or attend social functions without feeling extremely drained."
53380,And I’m scared to speak to my mother about this.
53381,She’s my best friend.
53382,"I adore her, I idolize her."
53383,I love her without end.
53384,But I’m so scared she’ll wave off my concerns because I communicate well and show extreme empathy.
53385,"I’m also concerned about bringing this all up with my new therapist that I see in a few weeks, but if they don’t listen I can just find a new therapist."
53386,I’m just.. I’m scared.
53387,And I’m not scared because I might be autistic.
53388,"I’m scared that I’ve finally found a reason why I’ve lagged so far behind my peers for so long, why I’ve never felt like an adult."
53389,"Why I struggle to do what feels like the most basic of adult things.. and if that’s taken from me, then what’s left?"
53390,Am I really just lazy and entitled and too sensitive?
53391,I’m sorry.
53392,This has gotten kind of long.
53393,I’m just.. struggling a bit.
53394,I wish I knew how to calm the voices and the concerns in the back of my mind.
53395,😞
53396,"I was a ""good"" kid at my adoptive parents house because they actually listened to me when I was with them."
53397,"I didn't need to be a ""chatterbox"" because there weren't a whole bunch of bigger ""more important"" people talking over me!"
53398,"Funny thing is I was an only child at both houses but had older, ""more important"" (golden child girl cousin) cousins around daily."
53399,"Not good but getting better, I think."
53400,I've been finalizing bills and final arrangements for my cat this morning.
53401,I start a new job this month but it's been really hard to get excited about it.
53402,I have two “good kids” and one squeaky wheel and I have to really stay aware of this every day.
53403,Default is easy to fall into.
53404,Parents who aren’t aware find out the hard way later because eventually “good kids” snap and either act out or grow bitter.
53405,I was a “good kid” that had a “bad attitude” from constantly having to be a “good kid” so I was never really seen as the good kid I actually was.
53406,It can be impossible to really be a great parent all the time so I try to make sure my children all have double the positive words/actions/experiences as they do negative ones.
53407,If I get a bit snippy in the day I try to give two organically positive praises later or if we have a bad morning I try to have a nice time outside later and maybe a nice sit down watching one of their shows.
53408,It’s all a balancing act.
53409,Criticism of children is a debt that must be paid back with interest.
53410,"Wow, this really hit me."
53411,"I wish I had started going to therapy earlier, maybe I could have worked this out and be better adjusted now."
53412,I feel like I missed my chance at happiness.
53413,I wish I felt comfortable telling my mom how I feel.
53414,I wish I felt comfortable becoming the person I want to be.
53415,I hate how accurate this is to my situation.
53416,Still coming to terms with everything they did to me.
53417,"i’ve never commented or posted here but i’m kind of struggling rn, i have good days but i just feel alone a lot of the time, but i’m okayy"
53418,"i just learned that in addition to all the stuff i’m dealing with from losing friends, my ex has been going behind my back and telling people that i’m a terrible person."
53419,i’m already aware that i was a bad partner.
53420,"i was not in a good place mentally when we were together, i had a lot going on."
53421,"i don’t need to be reminded of that, i still feel guilty."
53422,and we’ve talked about everything that happened and she said she forgave me.
53423,so why is she going around very obviously *not* having forgiven me?
53424,she’s turning all my friends against me.
53425,including my “best friend” who i’ve known since birth (i guess she’s not my best friend anymore…).
53426,"i know i’ve messed up a lot in the last two years, and it’s cost me a lot of friends, people i love with my whole heart who want nothing to do with me anymore."
53427,"it hurts more than i can explain, and even more so because i know it’s all *my* fault and i can’t fix it."
53428,"but it’s been a year since we broke up, i *thought* we were on good terms, why is she adding more to how sad and alone i already feel?"
53429,"it sucks, mom."
53430,"i don’t want to go back tomorrow, i don’t want to have to see her."
53431,"as bad of a partner as i was, that doesn’t justify her doing this to me, right?"
53432,or am i actually a bad person and i deserve this?
53433,"i’m trying so hard to be better, why can’t any of them see that?"
53434,"am i ever going to be better, or is bpd just going to define me for the rest of my life and at my very core i’m always going to be the bad guy?"
53435,"Hey mom, I hope your day is going well too!"
53436,"Not long ago, I settled some boundaries with my close friends following a huge clash of values we had."
53437,I've spent weeks trying to go halfway between my needs (mental health) and trying to keep a good relationship with my group of friends and realized that it was not a good way to go.
53438,Setting boundaries have been very helpful so far.
53439,"Reading your post, you make me realize today how I've kept my mouth shut about what I needed from my friends, and even from myself."
53440,"Took me a while to figure that I needed a break of my social life so I can recharge my battery, so I would work on those conflicts better later."
53441,Most of my friends were very understanding of my needs and are respecting the boundaries very well.
53442,"I'll see how to ""deal"" with that one friend who took my actions too personal later, giving this person some time to think and rest too."
53443,We will have some things to talk about in due time.
53444,"My day is almost boring, but boring feels very good for now."
53445,"After weeks of anxiety attacks and trying to juggle with too many things, boring feels very good, quite relaxing."
53446,I'm taking this time to rest and regain my energy.
53447,I have a new therapy appointment tomorrow to check how to work on recharging my battery properly.
53448,I'm somewhat excited for this appointment!
53449,"it’s been a shitty year but i turn 19 tomorrow :,) bittersweet"
53450,"Yep, this was me."
53451,"What my parents really prioritised growing up was being calm, quiet and getting descent grades."
53452,"So I did all that, and not much else."
53453,I wasn't expected to need anything.
53454,And ofc anxiety and depression started to run amok already at age 10-11.
53455,"But my parents didn't invite any confidence, still don't, now 20 years later."
53456,I just can't talk to them about anything real pertaining to my life.
53457,"I have never had parents that I knew I could turn to no matter what, unless I wanted to be mocked or at best be ignored."
53458,"its okay, I've been feeling super anxious and im unsure how to talk to my doctor about a new medication for it"
53459,"I was proud to be ""the good kid"" until recently I realised I just moulded myself into whatever my parents wanted me to be, just did everything I was told and was idle (sitting in front of the computer for hours) when they didn't call on me."
53460,No wonder I was depressed out of my mind.
53461,"I do this to my partners too, just become whoever they want me to be and shut down when they leave."
53462,"Only realised all this after moving out at 22, so glad I'm finding myself now!"
53463,Still grateful for my real mom and internet moms too:)
53464,"It's been alright...  
My cousin died yesterday, so I asked a freind if we could met up today, and she said yes."
53465,"Got to pet a cat, have a snake climb around on me, held a gecko and played Mario Kart."
53466,It was some good distraction.
53467,not that well unfortunately :( trying to heal from this is harder than I thought because I can’t suitable help.
53468,I’m not planning on giving up any time soon but it’s still a struggle every day.
53469,I’m trying to at least brighten other people’s life in the meantime until mine brightens again.
53470,"i wish this wasn't as true as it is :(

hi mom!!"
53471,i'm stressed because i'm making a big move in less than a month (3100 miles !!)
53472,but am doing my best to both prepare and keep myself calm.
53473,i'm a disaster
53474,I messed it up with someone and I think it is related to this...
53475,"When I was younger we had so many troubles so in order to remain ""strong"" and not be another burden for my mother I, slowly but steady, learned how to hide my feelings."
53476,"Basically I associated showing feelings with being ""wise, mature"" and not being a burden."
53477,"Fast foward to this day, I'm very confused when it comes to feelings and I still deny mine."
53478,"So, there was this person who was very into me and I really liked him."
53479,However I was scared to show my feelings and how he was making me feel in general... so I foolishly pushed him away on Saturday.
53480,Basically told him I'm not ready for us and I didn't want to talk to him.
53481,"And that's it, he accepted it and now he's gone."
53482,Already sent a couple of texts apologizing but it doesn't make it up for the horrible thing I did.
53483,"I don't even know if he has seen my messages, if he will see them and ignore, or what is going to happen."
53484,I completly understand if he doesn't want anything to do with me.
53485,And I'm hating myself so much for hurting him.
53486,"He's such a beautiful person, a ray of sunshine, super nice and cool."
53487,"Some weeks ago he said I deserved a chance to be happy, we both deserve it."
53488,"But I messed it up and now, there's the big chance I will never know."
53489,If I could give half of the life time I have remaning to go back and stop myself from saying such a foolery I would.
53490,I can only hope he isn't hurting as much as me and the weight of all this falls upon me.
53491,Because he deson't deserve it.
53492,If somehow he decides to forgive me and come back to me I'm giving it all.
53493,"Not more aloofness, denying my feelings or not being 100% honest about them."
53494,Mom I'm so sad and heartbroken.
53495,"This is just what I was avoiding by not allowing myself to ""feel"" and ignoring my feelings but the result was the same."
53496,Or worse.
53497,"To others out there who are trying to repress your feelings, please don't."
53498,Cherish yourself but also cherish others.
53499,"Call your significant other, family, friends, pets and tell them how much you appreciate them."
53500,"Thank you for putting into words something that is so true for me, yet I didn’t realize it needed to be named."
53501,You’ve given me quite a bit to think about.
53502,Doing my best.
53503,Job searching is really hard when I toss out tons of applications and I only get one interview (that I'm rejected after in about 12 hours).
53504,"I just want a remote job to pay bills, I might have to settle for a gas station in town, but long Covid limits my stamina so much so I worry."
53505,"Trying not to be discouraged, but you know how anxiety goes."
53506,Just had a stressful weekend with a somewhat abusive friend so winding down from that too.
53507,Someday things will get better.
53508,"I hope you're doing well, Mom."
53509,Still not sure if I’m pursuing my career path because I want it or because others wanted it for me.
53510,I wasn’t one of those kids at all.
53511,"In fact, I pretended to be that kid while going along and doing my own thing until I got caught, while my mom was distracted by my more volatile, much less tractable older siblings."
53512,Unfortunately now I seem to be raising a sweet 13 year old to be like this.
53513,"I don’t mean to, I want her to be able to stand up for herself and be independent and choose her life on her terms."
53514,"Unfortunately, we live in a blended family, and it’s been a definite adjustment mixing my style of parenting with my husbands’s."
53515,He has his boundaries of acceptable behaviour and they are slightly different than mine (mostly related to the concept of backtalk and respect; I was allowed a large amount of leniency as a child in communications with my mother while he had a more traditionally strict upbringing).
53516,"I respect his boundaries and extend my own past where I might ordinarily allow them to rest, and I worry that this is stifling my elder child’s sense of self expression and self respect."
53517,Or maybe she’s just 13.
53518,Idk.
53519,"And as my mother passed away long before my kids were born I really have no one to discuss this with, to gain perspective."
53520,I love my little family and try and respect each member of it.
53521,It’s very hard.
53522,"It’s a balancing act, that weighs on me along with everything else I have to do."
53523,I just need a little motherly encouragement i think..
53524,"Really exhausted, have an exam in three hours I'm not ready for, thanks for the check in, I hope your day is going ok :)"
53525,ive been trying everything to get some serotonin lmao.
53526,"&#x200B;

nothing worked so far, but im getting rlly good at sudoku 

&#x200B;

kinda giving up on myself atm, but im gonna assume it's gonna be fine

also yeah, the image is quite true"
53527,"I’m drowning tonight and I can’t remember the last real good day, where I was content or decked or even just painfree."
53528,I want to ask for help but I don’t know where to start.
53529,And I’m afraid if I ask for help with one thing that I’ll get it but won’t be satisfied or grateful and just desperate for more relief from the overwhelm in my brain and I’ll just keep asking for more and more and scare off anyone willing to help me.
53530,"My mother will say shit all the time like this— ""you're so smart, I wish you would do something with it"" like I'm not 27, barely surviving living in my car, while aslo being chronically disabled and in pain."
53531,Oh and also trans
53532,I don't know if it actually means anything but I want to think I resonate with this.
53533,"Someone’s making up lies about me at work and HR has basically told me there’s nothing I can do about it, since they can’t prove it’s not malicious."
53534,Layoffs are probably already going to happen and to think my job could be in jeopardy because of a lie just makes me want to rage…
53535,"Honestly, this hurts reading."
53536,I was my mom’s favorite child because I never ‘needed’ anything and I was an over achiever.
53537,"I have ADHD and had the opportunity to have access to medication when I was 9, but my mom took me off the meds because I became ‘weepy’."
53538,"I understand she was having to deal with abuse from my dad and was probably having a hard time dealing with negative emotions, but it really did make a big impact on how I learned to control myself when I feel upset."
53539,I’m trying so hard to make sure I don’t do that to my three kids.
53540,"Some days, it’s much harder than others, but I’m actually trying."
53541,"I apologize to my three year old, something I was never a recipient of, and my older two when I act out of line."
53542,"I’m doing much better than I ever was, but I feel terrible right now because I lost my temper with my daughter a couple of days ago."
53543,"I did something inexcusable, I over reacted about something so small… I never got taught how to control my anger in a healthy way, so it usually builds up and explodes."
53544,I just wish someone would have actually taught me how to deal with negativity when I was growing up.
53545,And now I sincerely wish someone could give me a hug…😭😭
53546,This post explains a lot of why I am the way I am.
53547,"While I wasn't a quiet child, I did try to avoid disobeying my parents because my father was very impatient and overreacted when angry and frustrated."
53548,"I was always this good kid, now I wish I wasn't"
53549,Oh goodness no.
53550,"If anything society failed to give you the stuff you need to succeed, like support and properly motivated achievements that you could really appreciate for yourself."
53551,But hey!
53552,"Like any other time when someone in charge messed up, that just means that now, if you want it done right, you'll have to do it yourself."
53553,"That's all those other people did, they were forcefully pushed to their limits, so they found what they could do sooner."
53554,"That's all, but it's not enviable, I promise."
53555,They're just as miserable that no one let them relax and explore and discover stuff at their own pace or gave them help.
53556,Creativity is just a survival instinct.
53557,You can cultivate yours at any time Duck.
53558,I promise.
53559,All it takes is risk.
53560,"Proper, healthy, loving to yourself, risk."
53561,Just stretch your wings a little and you might be surprised how resilient they can be.
53562,"And if not, a good mom is there to support you and cheer you on to try again."
53563,"You can be anything you want to be, that wasn't a lie."
53564,What they didn't tell you was the sacrifice and the work and the grueling effort it takes to get where you want to be.
53565,That's the part everyone kind of glosses over.
53566,That's why it's also okay to just appreciate what you have rather than chase something unsure.
53567,You just have to figure out what's enough for you.
53568,That's all.
53569,💙
53570,"This is very relatable, even though I wasn't a perfect child."
53571,"oh my god, you just typed out my whole life with this comment."
53572,And now I’m stuck in a position where I can’t choose.
53573,Sometimes I wish I was a rebellious and passionate child as well.
53574,Damn straight.
53575,Hugs sib.
53576,Have you ever looked into therapy?
53577,"I know it’s hard because it’s so stigmatized, but I have found it super helpful and healing."
53578,"This is very relatable, though my parents weren't abusive."
53579,"My dad was very impatient and I seem to remember being very needy, disobedient and bothersome but according to mom I was a very good child."
53580,"I guess I only remember the very few times I somewhat opposed something I was expected or told to do, which caused my dad to overreact in anger and frustration."
53581,That I totally sympathize with.
53582,Any relief in sight?
53583,Ugh that sucks.
53584,We’re here for you duckling.
53585,Come by and visit any time 🤗
53586,Are you seeing a psychologist?
53587,"If not, do you have the means to?"
53588,"I’m assuming your feelings are caused or exacerbated by mental health issues and/or stress, which I can definitely understand."
53589,Yep that is brutal and please have a hug.
53590,It's exhausting trying to save anything that people are actively fighting you on.
53591,"Take time for self-care in here just for a minute, so that you can get back to the fight out there."
53592,"Have a virtual hug, get some sleep if you can."
53593,You won't be much help to anyone without rest.
53594,"Live to fight another day, hopefully."
53595,💙
53596,"No worries, we definitely have tons of room, please deposit your emotional baggage and really let it go if possible."
53597,"It's heavy and you don't need to carry it, I promise."
53598,That shame isn't yours put it down and walk away.
53599,"Shame is always external first, it's something other people give us and we can reject it at any time."
53600,"Disassociate away Duckling, we're right here to anchor against when you're ready to come home."
53601,💙🤗
53602,"Personally I recommend requesting her to do research on what it means to be trans, and stories from trans people."
53603,Stories are important so she doesn’t go down any ‘sky daddy hates the gays’ rabbit holes.
53604,"If you need to reduce or cut contact, even temporarily to give her space while she does her research and decides what kind of mother she wants to be, then please do."
53605,It might be hard but I think it’s a boundary you need to set.
53606,She’s deliberately causing you a lot of emotional turmoil and you deserve better than that.
53607,I’m also proud of you for knowing what’s going on in your mind while you typed this.
53608,Mindfulness and self-awareness are so important for being able to maintain our own balance.
53609,"You’re right, you will be okay."
53610,"It might take some time, but you will."
53611,"If you can, reach out to your support system and maintain those contacts."
53612,Friends make everything easier.
53613,"Ugh nightmares and not enough sleep, what a recipe for success, right?"
53614,"But wait... Hey, you are alive and safe at your job!"
53615,That's awesome!
53616,Take a minute to sleepily appreciate your efforts and your success.
53617,"I certainly am, you rock!"
53618,💙
53619,Virtual hug for you duckling!
53620,I’m glad you are safe and I’m proud of you.
53621,"Take some time today to do something you enjoy, draw a picture or listen to music or play a game."
53622,Self care is important.
53623,I can relate sib (sis?).
53624,Used to have at least an outwardly solid relationship with my parents until I realized I was queer.
53625,Came out to them in January and we’ve barely talked since.
53626,Looking forward to moving to cut contact even more.
53627,Hey I'm almost the same.
53628,You have a great relationship as long as you conform to their ideal child.
53629,Good luck on the nightmares.
53630,The only thing that slowed them for me was meds :/
53631,Wow this is almost my experience to the tea except that i didnt come out or anything.
53632,She was so upset over the fact that I had gone to a neighboring city with a college friend for a day vacation.
53633,I was wondering why that was a big deal because Im in college now and she doesnt check in with me almost ever to see where i am going.. How does she know im not going to farther places all the time??
53634,Im not.
53635,Im just studying.
53636,This still doesnt make that much sense to me.
53637,I am the middle daughter of 3 girls in my family and ive always had such a long leash of freedom that i thought that that was the rule.
53638,Now she is switching the rules on me and its so confusing.
53639,We had a big fight about that and other things that we never resolve and then she told me to leave.
53640,I was so shocked that i drove to my local library and sat in the parking lot.
53641,"(She told me a lot of other things too like how id never find another family that would love me as much as they did, etc.)"
53642,Sometimes as an anxious person i would think of scenarios right before i go to sleep or just when i was bored about fights i might have or situations i might find myself in and i would plan it all out.
53643,But i had never planned for this one.
53644,I know the feeling!
53645,At least you got the explanation and now you still have time left to make a difference in how you treat yourself.
53646,"Love yourself instead of fucking yourself, right?"
53647,Other people will do enough of that.
53648,Wanna hug it out?
53649,"Hey Duck, that is always a heck of a hurdle."
53650,Some moms just don't have that in them.
53651,They can't praise and love you for you because they're miserable with themselves.
53652,"They just need you to do everything they didn't do, mostly because they had you and then blamed you for it."
53653,"Moms like that are parents of ego, and that is never a recipe for a well adjusted adult child."
53654,Have you looked into therapy to work on letting go of your need for her approval?
53655,"You don't have to, just asking."
53656,You can also just decide at any time that she doesn't matter any longer.
53657,That's a real thing you can actually do.
53658,Just decide that you don't care what she thinks anymore.
53659,"Once that happens, it goes (usually one of two ways) to make her finally respect you as an adult and let you do your thing, or she locks up and then you can read about NarcMoms which might be helpful."
53660,"Either way, full marks from this mom for not falling into the trap this time!"
53661,Good for you!
53662,💙🤗
53663,"That's a classic trauma response, and I'm guessing you're a classy person."
53664,"You deserve to be appreciated and know that you are enough, just as you are."
53665,If you need external validation it's not always automatically bad either!
53666,"You just have to get it in healthy ways, like from moms for a minute on Reddit."
53667,This is healthier at least because it's freely given and you can just bask without having to perform.
53668,"Feel free to ask around here, people can't wait to tell you you're awesome."
53669,Probably cause you are!
53670,💙
53671,"Hey Duckling, is there anyone IRL that you can call or text?"
53672,If not that's okay too!
53673,We're here and you are definitely not alone.
53674,Have a virtual hug if needed and feel free to make a post so you can get more hugs okay?
53675,💙
53676,We're really glad you get to have a lunch break even if we kind of accidentally made it chilly.
53677,Have a hug to warm up?
53678,🤗💙
53679,"OMG me too, I was severely depressed at 11 years old but never said a word because I didn't want to get negative pushback for bringing a problem to the table."
53680,I suffered in silence instead.
53681,Oh that sounds amazing.
53682,Yes please!
53683,"But also, thank you for being responsible and going to do the life stuff first."
53684,"Really made me proud that you're taking care of yourself and treating yourself right in every way, treat yo self!"
53685,😁👍
53686,So true.
53687,Weird the stuff our brains finally click onto right?
53688,🤗
53689,Same.
53690,I wish I had made my needs known.
53691,"That said, I'm not sure I had the ability to express myself properly."
53692,That's perfect.
53693,"Boundaries and everything, look at you!"
53694,Look at how successfully you are parenting right now!
53695,Give yourself a high five and have a virtual hug.
53696,You're a badass.
53697,🤗
53698,Glad you're happy to be checked in on!
53699,"If you haven't found a great solution yet, I highly recommend looking up foam, like upholstery foam on Amazon."
53700,You can buy big blocks for cheap and customize a sitting up set up!
53701,I've helped people build these for different conditions like EDS and it might be useful for you too.
53702,Have a gentle hug if you want one Ducks.
53703,Feel free to check in with us too if you need any advice or support going forward!
53704,🤗💙
53705,That's definitely rough.
53706,"Let's try to manage the emotional rollercoaster just until you get more data, right?"
53707,That's the right time to have some negative stuff.
53708,"But, you can also feel better by researching your options now."
53709,What's your worst case scenario look like?
53710,How can you effectively handle the worst if it happens?
53711,"That will really help your anxiety and depression, to have a plan or at least start looking for one."
53712,"It sucks, and it's not fair."
53713,"How can you make sure you get what you need anyway, in spite of them if necessary?"
53714,Empathy is one of the only things that truly connects humans.
53715,"Unfortunately, you (hopefully) won't ever know their pain, and vice versa."
53716,"You can try to talk about it, but until they are in a place where they can finally understand, it's pretty useless."
53717,"And once they do get to that place (""Oh, if they do!"""
53718,"Combined with ""Oh... if they *do*?"")"
53719,then they'll be the ones reaching out to you anyway.
53720,"So don't stress about it either way Ducks, you can't control it so you can't worry about it."
53721,"Their empathy journey is theirs alone, fortunately and unfortunately."
53722,Would a hug help?
53723,That's always the toughest thing to say right?
53724,When you have to realize what actually happened to you?
53725,"Well, I'm super proud of you for coming to realize it and working so hard on it that you were able to comment here today."
53726,"So, thank you for existing."
53727,I really appreciate you.
53728,I love you and you are awesome.
53729,"If you're interested, please have a digital-mom hug."
53730,You've won so far.
53731,Keep winning.
53732,🤗💙
53733,"That's awesome, glad to hear you're feeling better!"
53734,Even just a little is better than nothing.
53735,"💙

Also, I can't answer for all the moms hopefully they'll let you know!"
53736,I'm just excited to check in with my ducklings and see how everyone is.
53737,I'm planning to ride that high as long as I can lol.
53738,Damn straight!
53739,And one for you too!
53740,For being awesome.
53741,╰(*´︶`*)╯
53742,Please feel free to take this virtual hug and hopefully you'll get one IRL soon!
53743,💙🤗
53744,That's always something people who grow up with physically intimidating mothers have that's like so different from other kids.
53745,It's really hard to explain but I totally get you.
53746,"Have a hug, you're definitely not alone."
53747,🤗
53748,That's fantastic news Ducky!
53749,💙🤓
53750,"That's definitely the worst thing about being a responsible pet parent, it's so hard to know when something is wrong."
53751,You loved him.
53752,That was all you could do.
53753,You tried your best.
53754,That's also all you can do.
53755,You can and will miss them but that's normal too.
53756,Really happy that you have a solid support system!
53757,"That's great, and please give your other furbabies a good big hug from us too!"
53758,💙
53759,That really was incredibly unfair.
53760,School is just a training sim for working in a factory and it's incredibly outdated.
53761,You never should have been forced to do anything and I'm sorry you were.
53762,Please feel free to sit very still and rage about it if it helps.
53763,"But that's usually just the pain talking, so really, I empathize with you and your pain."
53764,"You're definitely being heard now, hopefully you feel a little more seen today because of it."
53765,💙
53766,Congrats!!
53767,💙
53768,Aww good work!
53769,Congratulations on your achievement and please have a big hug!
53770,"💙

ლ(・﹏・ლ)"
53771,"No worries Duckling, let it all out right here so you can take one more step to totally letting it go."
53772,I love you and I believe in you.
53773,💙
53774,You may not!
53775,"Or at least not all of it, but that can be okay too!"
53776,"At a certain point in love or in life, you'll realize that's there's a lot of potential truth in ""ignorance is bliss"" and you'll start to appreciate the beauty of not knowing, the freedom of not having to know everything all the time."
53777,"It's not a guarantee, but it's pretty common."
53778,"I hope that helps you a little, this may not feel so weird later, that's all."
53779,Still really proud of you for respectful boundaries and letting your NC stand!
53780,🤗💙
53781,That's normal and you know that so you got this.
53782,So proud of you Duckling.
53783,(っ.❛ ᴗ ❛.
53784,)っ
53785,"Well, you know how to rely on yourself, which is incredibly valuable too."
53786,But yep never hurts to ask for help.
53787,The worst they can say is no.
53788,"The real trick is in learning how to ask for what you need until you get it, meaning you really can save a ton of time by determining how to ask, who to ask, etc."
53789,Maximize your chances of success right?
53790,"But YOLO is for quitters, so, coming back then, hopefully!"
53791,"Hey, that's not totally on you."
53792,"If you had proper support from your community, you wouldn't have to struggle as hard, right?"
53793,Have you checked out r/assistance?
53794,"If she's as emotionally intelligent as she sounds, just ask if you're a burden."
53795,"Seriously, you're only having that anxiety because you don't know, so ask."
53796,"If she's a mom for a minute IRL, she'll be happy to reassure you, help you by setting healthy boundaries so that you can see what that looks like and then help you grow your own."
53797,Just ask if your communication is too frequent.
53798,The answer might surprise you but we're here either way for support after.
53799,💙
53800,"Hey, sometimes families are supportive, sometimes not."
53801,"As long as you have support, what you tell them is your business."
53802,💙
53803,You can tell us!
53804,We're super proud of you and excited for your growth!
53805,"Self-discipline is a rocky road at first, but eventually it's all smooth strawberry."
53806,Cause you love yourself and get all gooey and pink on the inside.
53807,With love.
53808,♥️
53809,Then I'm very sorry you have to be so strong.
53810,But I'm proud of you for doing it.
53811,You can be proud of yourself too.
53812,💙
53813,Fear is healthy!
53814,It makes you careful.
53815,"ABSOLUTELY we can do that, have a giant hug and everything will be okay as long as you are Duckling."
53816,I promise.
53817,"And if you're not okay, you find me and we patch you back up together."
53818,Cause I'm on your team kiddo and I'm rooting for you.
53819,(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ 💙
53820,Absolutely agreed.
53821,"That's okay, too."
53822,We're really proud of you for getting better.
53823,"It's okay to not be perfect yet, this is just a work in progress."
53824,🤗
53825,We can absolutely provide the hug.
53826,"Virtual hug options:

🤗

Or

(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ"
53827,Have you been able to find resources to take steps in that direction?
53828,Need any help?
53829,Maybe just a hug?
53830,Any time!
53831,💙🤗
53832,"That realization is so difficult, right?"
53833,But look at you!
53834,You did that part already!
53835,You are over the hump of realization and now you can cruise the highway of happiness and hope for your future self.
53836,"Keep your boundaries strong, defend them really with your life."
53837,"They are what will save you, because now you're going to save yourself."
53838,"You already are, it's inevitable now."
53839,💙
53840,"Yeah, I get that."
53841,Do you have anyone in your life that you feel you are good enough for?
53842,"If not, please know, no matter what, you're more than good enough for me."
53843,"I love you and I'm so proud of you, just for existing."
53844,🤗💙
53845,It sucks the whole asshole Ducky.
53846,Totes agree.
53847,Wanna take some time and talk about it more?
53848,Or perhaps I can offset some of the suck with a hug?
53849,Big fluffy virtual hug?
53850,💙
53851,Hey!
53852,Hi!
53853,I'm absolutely that Rent A Mom.
53854,Let's do this!
53855,What do you need Ducky?!
53856,Ask me how to do anything!
53857,💙
53858,That takeaway is the best though.
53859,You got through it.
53860,You did that.
53861,You could probably do anything!
53862,💙
53863,That's so smart!
53864,"Intelligent thinking, guided by experience from last time."
53865,Literally a recipe for success.
53866,Just hang in a little longer.
53867,Would you like a distraction hug?
53868,Glad you're doing alright!
53869,It seems like you have a good handle on things and we're really proud of you for that!
53870,💙
53871,Of course!
53872,Hope your having a really good day!
53873,💙
53874,Good work on the tiny steps!
53875,They all add up!
53876,"You'll be so prepared for tomorrow and you'll do so well, it's gonna be great."
53877,Good luck and keep your head buried in the bear.
53878,"#ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ

Bam!"
53879,Bearhug.
53880,That's always a struggle.
53881,Please check r/assistance.
53882,They might be able to get you some help?
53883,That's so great.
53884,You're really awesome for taking such great care of her.
53885,💙
53886,Ugh in a perfect world right?
53887,"But at least in this one, you got to let it out a little onto the void!"
53888,"And look, the void loves you and is proud of you and really wants to hug you."
53889,Would you like a void hug?
53890,It's warmer and comfier than you think!
53891,"Oh sweet Scorp baby, you're probably the best kid ever."
53892,"Thank you for trusting me enough to post this comment, truly."
53893,"For a Scorpio, there's no higher horror than trust, believe me."
53894,Sending a massive hug because fuck yeah you did so well Ducky!
53895,🤗🖤
53896,"Hey Ducks, have you reached out IRL for help yet?"
53897,Do you need help finding help?
53898,Please let me know.
53899,"Sending hugs and sympathy, because yeah this sucks."
53900,You are not alone though!
53901,"We're here for emotional support and hugs, which isn't much, but maybe it's enough?"
53902,Just for today?
53903,💙
53904,That's fair.
53905,"Good luck with the recording, have a hug!"
53906,🤗💙
53907,I'm sorry they weren't capable of being what you need.
53908,I hope now you're finding people who can be?
53909,Have a hug if it helps?
53910,🤗
53911,Hey it's okay!
53912,If you were hiding that only means the people around you didn't do enough to earn or keep your trust safe.
53913,That's good to be aware of that's a plus.
53914,"Now you know what unsafe looks like, and you found us, safety!"
53915,So that's fine if you're having to protect yourself right now.
53916,But look for the people IRL that feel safe.
53917,Reach out to them or find support here when needed.
53918,"You're not alone now unless you want to be duck, we're here."
53919,💙
53920,That's okay.
53921,You can hold it until it hurts you more to hang on to than to let go.
53922,"You'll know when that moment comes, just try to trust your feelings now if you still need them then that's because you do."
53923,Nothing wrong with that.
53924,Are you talking to someone about the abuse?
53925,"That's the way, focus on the positive, plan for the rest of the negative."
53926,You got this.
53927,You'll get it all taken care of.
53928,Slow and steady and check r/assistance!
53929,That's epic and I'm actually super proud and excited.
53930,Got screenshots?!
53931,Nerd with me!
53932,🤓💙
53933,"You're not alone in any of that and it can feel so isolating, so I just want to remind you."
53934,"Have an extra big hug:

#ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ

Bam!"
53935,Bearhug.
53936,Congrats!
53937,💙
53938,That's a completely reasonable boundary ducks.
53939,I'm proud of you for protecting yourself even if she didn't!
53940,💙🤗
53941,No problem Ducky leave it all there.
53942,Have a huge hug in exchange.
53943,"💙

#(っ.❛ ᴗ ❛."
53944,)っ
53945,That's truly a horrible thing to say to a kid I agree.
53946,"You deserved better, but you've gotten this far because of your strength."
53947,"It sucks you had to be that strong, but I'm really grateful you made it here to comment."
53948,💙
53949,That's definitely understandable.
53950,"We can't bring stuff back, but we can give you a hug and tell you that you're loved."
53951,Losing things is always tough and nothing will really make it better but time.
53952,Hey that's fine too!
53953,You are under no obligation to.
53954,"It's possible that you just noticed their discomfort or negative response, but I'm a subconscious kind of way."
53955,"Like you may have seen something that they tried to hide or cover that made you even more uncomfortable, because then you couldn't trust their reactions in a bunch of different ways."
53956,Totally okay to not know though!
53957,Especially if it hasn't hurt you.
53958,🤗💙
53959,Hmmm let's see.
53960,Do you work better with internal or external motivation?
53961,Yay!
53962,We love it when our Ducklings are loved the way they deserve!
53963,We're pretty proud of you for picking a good one.
53964,😁💙
53965,"Nothing wrong with whatever you want Ducks, just have to decide what it is and then you can get to the ""living your best life""  part."
53966,Making decisions is always tough and that's normal.
53967,"There's always a cost, or it wouldn't be a choice."
53968,You just have to decide what you can live with.
53969,"Take your time, it's possible that the reason you're still in conflict is because you tried to rush it."
53970,See if slowing down and accepting the journey as it's own reward might make you feel a little better about the length of it?
53971,"After all, it's just another way you're discovering yourself and that's always a good thing."
53972,💙
53973,That sucks.
53974,Would you like hug?
53975,Or would you like to get some resources for the breakdown?
53976,We're really proud of you for picking up your pieces and putting them back together.
53977,💙
53978,Congrats on your journey Duckling.
53979,💙

/s

You doing okay with not liking it or do you want to talk it out?"
53981,💙
53982,No worries.
53983,Have a virtual hug and a good day hopefully!
53984,💙🤗
53985,Naps are actually super useful for processing power.
53986,Take a hug with you and a stuffed animal if need be.
53987,We're here if you need to talk after.
53988,No rush.
53989,💙
53990,Well that's inappropriate.
53991,Please contact someone in real life about that immediately.
53992,Oh yeah the joy of new stationary cannot be underestimated.
53993,It's okay to struggle that means you're still fighting for what you need.
53994,Sometimes what you need is good stationary.
53995,What did you pick up?
53996,💙
53997,That's depressingly common for 25.
53998,I'm really sorry that there isn't a better solution for you yet Ducks.
53999,You're not alone if that helps.
54000,Hug?
54001,🤗
54002,Have you gotten checked for depression?
54003,That's something that could explain why it's so hard to feel the joy you intellectually know you should.
54004,"Not saying you have to, just might make you feel better to get some answers."
54005,💙
54006,Are you getting proper help for your anxiety Ducks?
54007,💙
54008,"I would think that's pretty normal, it's a big chunk of a budget."
54009,Are you able to afford your options?
54010,That sounds so tiring.
54011,"Have you been doing anything for your self-care, making sure you prioritize yourself some days?"
54012,"Hey, that's not that unusual."
54013,"It's really easy to get discouraged even we are making progress and moving forward, because we let our brain skip ahead and imagine the good stuff."
54014,"Keeping the focus on the present and the huge strides you've already made, even just reminding yourself how hard you're working on the now, that might help you stay grounded?"
54015,"If that doesn't, there are million other things that might work and I'll be here to suggest them all until we find one that helps."
54016,💙
54017,I'm very sorry you're going through this Duckling.
54018,Please have a virtual hug if it helps.
54019,"Those people may not appreciate you, but we do."
54020,💙
54021,"Hey please have a hug

⊂((・▽・))⊃

And it's going to be okay as long as you are."
54022,And you're here still so that's pretty much the right direction.
54023,💙
54024,"I personally promise that unless you have an allergy, they will not kill you."
54025,"They might (literally an infinitesimal chance) have some adverse effects, but those are all often less scary than the anxiety they are treating because even if you have an allergy, you probably still won't panic about it."
54026,It will be the calmest crisis of your life.
54027,"Get the meds take the meds come here and chat with me for the entire duration of the medicine at first if needed, so you'll have someone who can talk you though any weird stuff you feel."
54028,Whatever it takes.
54029,This is like walking around with a broken leg and you're worried the cast might have an impact on your walking.
54030,"It's literally going to have an impact yes, but I promise, if it works the way it should and usually does, you're going to realize pretty quick how great it feels to take the pressure off your injuries."
54031,I'm sorry for your lost time.
54032,"And your losing the relationship you had even if might be better this way, that doesn't mean it didn't hurt."
54033,Sometimes we mourn our abusers even if we shouldn't and that's nothing to be negative about.
54034,It's just what we need to break free and heal.
54035,"You're still going, but you've got this."
54036,You're not!
54037,You are a human who hit a hurdle - that's normal.
54038,It's your business so the good thing is that tomorrow you can just channel all your frustrations into working hard enough to prove that they missed out on getting to know and experience their awesome kid.
54039,Right?
54040,Just like that Ducks.
54041,Just get it all out in a safe place.
54042,You did great.
54043,💙🤗
54044,Ah I see!
54045,The dreaded cousinsized interlopers.
54046,"Please know you're not alone in that cousin syndrome thing, it's often worse between hypercompetitive siblings."
54047,Have a big hug?
54048,╰(⸝⸝⸝´꒳`⸝⸝⸝)╯
54049,That's normal when you're in pain.
54050,It's hard to get excited.
54051,That's okay.
54052,"This should feel a little bittersweet or uncomfortable, because you are having to prepare to deal with a loss."
54053,Have a virtual hug if it feels right.
54054,(o´･_･)っ
54055,That's really awesome that you're being so intentional about it.
54056,"Good job, you have every right to feel proud of you and I am too!"
54057,💙
54058,It's never too late to get comfy.
54059,Anything that might help you feel like you've made some progress?
54060,"If you think the window is closed already, it's usually just because you decided it was."
54061,Can you double check?
54062,That's hard work and work you can be proud of.
54063,I am absolutely proud of you!
54064,"Hey, that's great that you reached out!"
54065,We're really happy to have you even for a minute.
54066,"Just in case this is my only chance, from a mom, I love you and you're awesome and I am so proud of you already just for existing."
54067,Please have a hug if you want 🤗 and come back here any time for an extra one okay?
54068,💙
54069,Unfortunately Ducky it's all outside your control.
54070,Ask yourself if you are committed to being better.
54071,If you are then you will be eventually.
54072,"If you always think you're the bad guy, then it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks right?"
54073,Are you seeing anyone about the BPD?
54074,How's your support looking with those hurdles?
54075,We're excited for you too!
54076,Good luck and please feel free to let us know how it goes!
54077,💙
54078,Fair.
54079,Happy birthday if it feels right and have a hug either way?
54080,🤗
54081,"That's really so hard, right?"
54082,Having to hold so much of that inside?
54083,"Even as a little kid... Well I'm very proud of you for getting this far, even if you had to go it alone before."
54084,"Now you can build a new family, any (respectful) way you wanna do it, because look at how strong you already had to be."
54085,"I'm really proud of you for making it here, even if it was hard."
54086,You did it.
54087,Sending a hug if you're interested?
54088,🤗
54089,That's so great.
54090,Thank you for taking steps to get yourself help!
54091,That means so much to me.
54092,💙
54093,We're still so grateful for you too!
54094,🤗💙
54095,That's really sad and then very awesome in one comment.
54096,I am so sorry and yet so grateful you weren't alone.
54097,Please have a hug if you want and know that mourning is whatever you say it is.
54098,"So, you do you."
54099,That's the whole point.
54100,💙
54101,"Helping others is over and above my top tip to feel better about anything, so kudos."
54102,You're doing great and don't give up it's tough but you've won so far.
54103,"Look at you, still alive and kicking!"
54104,I'm thankful and I love you and please have a hug if it's not too creepy.
54105,🤗
54106,Good luck!
54107,"Focus on the plan, keep your brain on the tasks your currently doing and breathe."
54108,Pop on here any time for a hug and reassurance.
54109,But you've got this.
54110,I believe in you.
54111,🤗💙
54112,"Okay, I'm the OEM, how can I help?"
54113,So true!
54114,"Great advice, I'm just so sorry it cost you so much to be able to have the wisdom to give it."
54115,"Sending massive hugs because been there, done that and a hug might help."
54116,You're not alone.
54117,💙(･–･) \\(･_･)/
54118,We're really glad it helped you think.
54119,(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
54120,"I'm okay, thank you for asking!"
54121,Also please have a hug.
54122,Even if you're doing okay hugs might help a little.
54123,⊂(•‿•⊂ )*.✧
54124,Hmm.
54125,That's a tough one.
54126,Do you wanna talk it out or just ponder a little more?
54127,Have a hug either way?
54128,🤗💙
54129,"That's completely fair, have a hug and please know that I'm really proud of you."
54130,Keep doing your best and feel free to come here and ask if you need perspective?
54131,No problem Ducks have a good day and good luck and then get some sleep!
54132,💙
54133,"Can I invite you to try:

/r/Catsubs/wiki/index"
54134,Take the step.
54135,Ask for the help.
54136,Even if it’s an online therapist over the people next to you.
54137,Sometimes just making that first move frees you to find the right help.
54138,Hugs.
54139,"(o´･_･)っ

💙"
54140,"(⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃

Have a hug?"
54141,Did you just cut up some onions?
54142,😭
54143,"Wow, I also needed to hear this ♡ thank you!"
54144,I guess not
54145,No I don’t.
54146,My GP told my dad that I needed to see a therapist but my dad has never made   it happen.
54147,Thank you.
54148,My mom is a TERF so I don't know if I'll ever be able to convince her.
54149,I have been avoiding her as much as I can but its very hard because I still desperately want her love and approval and i don't think I'm ever going to get if and that just hurts so much.
54150,"Talking about it helps, at least, so thank you ❤"
54151,Awwww tnx :'( this actually made me smile.
54152,I just washed my face and am drinking tea.
54153,Thank you for the lift up :_) <3
54154,Thank youuuu.
54155,I took a shower and watched a goofy movie.
54156,;_; <3
54157,I wish things go well for you.
54158,You're gonna be awesome.
54159,"If I could help in any way, you can count on your sister."
54160,:*
54161,I do.
54162,Thank you.
54163,*Hug*
54164,Thanks!
54165,"Thank you, that's a good idea!"
54166,I've tried a cheese wedge foam pillow but it's just too hard on my back and wasn't comfy at all.
54167,I'll definitely look into blocks though and see if they're for me so thanks 😊
54168,"So I talked to a financial advisor, an academic advisor, and a counselor at school and everyone said the same thing."
54169,Theres no way to reinstate my financial aid.
54170,There are no scholarships or grants available at this time.
54171,No emergency funds im not already receiving.
54172,"Since I have enough credit hours I could get my AA, which would reset the max time limit im at for federal aid so I can use the last of my federal aid to complete my AS (that im 2 semesters away from finishing)."
54173,But im missing 3 requirements so thats not a short term solution.
54174,"Id still have to drop out of my program to finish the last 3 classes to get the AA, and with no financial aid that's 2k out of pocket to pay for it."
54175,Which is what this semester of my AS costs anyway.
54176,"I could pay my 2k tuition in installments, but its 430 a month."
54177,I realistically cant work a real job with classes 9am-8pm Monday and clinical hours from 7am-6pm Tues-Fri.
54178,"I have Saturday and Sunday available, but no child care (and I babysit so my roommate can work Saturdays anyway)."
54179,I cant get any private loans without a cosigner.
54180,No one in my life can co sign.
54181,So..worst case scenario I drop out of school 2 semesters before my degree after I've been in school for 4 grueling years.
54182,30k in student loan debt with no realistic way to pay.
54183,"Im already living in someone else's front room, so at least im not technically homeless."
54184,But all the bills there are overdue so I very well might be.
54185,"Which means moving 2k miles away to live with my mother, on the couch."
54186,Giving up my very loving boyfriend where I live.
54187,Staying in poverty which I've tried so hard to break free from.
54188,I dont know what else to do to pay for school
54189,"Yeah, at this point I would take it."
54190,Thank you
54191,"Thank you so much for this lovely, caring response!"
54192,Those are wonderful words that I have never heard from my own mom ❤️
54193,"You're happy, that's good."
54194,Find happiness in the little things right.
54195,And that little better or not as worse makes a big difference.
54196,"Yesterday I was feeling like ""I have no idea how I'm gonna make it"" and today I'm thinking ""it's bad but it's okay I guess"""
54197,Awww thanks 🥰
54198,Thank you!
54199,Tysm and I definitely will hug them all from you!
54200,"Thank you, these days i deal with a different force pushing down."
54201,I fell a lot as a kid too so i have a bit of nerve damage and early age arthritis in my back.
54202,"My own body punishes activity and all i hear is ""youre too young for that"" so i take support where i can."
54203,"I didnt realize id held in that frustration from childhood and had a small cry already but again thank you, its not lonely in the void here"
54204,Thank you Mom ❤️
54205,I think I see what you're saying and I'll certainly consider it.
54206,Thank you 💙
54207,I needed that.
54208,Thank you.
54209,Ah yes!
54210,Happens every time.
54211,[deleted]
54212,Thank you!
54213,I actually asked her if I might be a burden.
54214,She told me that I can count on her anytime and  I always can contact her.
54215,As any nice woman do.
54216,"Sometimes she tells me that she will call me and then forgets, because she is too busy with her own family."
54217,"I know that she can support me emotionally, but I don't want to take out of her time too much."
54218,"I wish I had a spreadsheet of ""reasonable time frame of talking to your aunt""."
54219,"She is my mom's sister and she reminds me of her a lot, even with the fact that I can't recall any memories of my mom at all."
54220,"I want to form a relationship, but I'm scared that I might be subconsciously rely on her too much."
54221,"I don't want to frustrate people:(  
P.s."
54222,"I rarely comment or post, so I just want to tell that this sub is wonderful and very helpful."
54223,Made me realize a lot of things.
54224,Thank you for your encouragement.
54225,💛💛💛
54226,Tanks you...
54227,"Thank you🙂you’re absolutely right, fear IS healthy!"
54228,"I’ve just feeling afraid of the future too much lately, and I’m really trying to get out of that."
54229,"It’s mentally exhausting, I’ll say that."
54230,"But thoughts aren’t facts, so I know I’ll get through this."
54231,I’m super thankful for you and that I found this community!🙂
54232,Thank you..
54233,"I hope she's okay,  I was toxic and I hurt myself in the process I was a monster and now I'm in intensive therapy 
I feel awful im a monster to someone but ig it wasn't just black and white in the moment so I should be more understanding of that"
54234,I like version two 🥰
54235,Id love the virtual hug!
54236,That made my day.
54237,"Im reading ""Reinventing yourself"" which goes over life traps that can hang you up, and already read through the series of books that starts with ""adult children of emotionally immature parents"" ."
54238,Its weird cause im decent at stating my needs and wants and bringing up problems....unless its my partner or family.
54239,Then I just freeze.
54240,"If you have resources targeting the self worth and abandonment issues that fuel a fear of speaking up to people that are important to you, Id love that, but no pressure!"
54241,"Again, your response made my day a lot brighter."
54242,Thank you for that.
54243,Thank you ❤️
54244,I feel like I don't.
54245,Only person who give me sence of this is on holidays and I miss her 😔In fact I feel pretty low
54246,a fluffy virtual hug sounds pleasing.
54247,While knowing this fact sucks; my friend who went through a similar thing knocked some truth into me.
54248,And I've been working on myself for a couple weeks too.
54249,"I'm just pleased to run into your post OP, and reading the other replies gives me hope and strength."
54250,Yes please!
54251,I miss hugs.
54252,Thank you.
54253,"Most of the replys were to go through carvana, they want to do 20% interest."
54254,I'm trying to do what all of the credit subreddit says not to and get a cosigner.
54255,I'm not done trying yet.
54256,Thank you.
54257,"I appreciate your kind words, people still think I should push her into uncomfortable situations to get over her anxiety."
54258,Nope not doing it.
54259,Yeah that would be great.
54260,"Better than my parents who would down play my thoughts, feelings, and emotions and now adays they treat me as if I'm not doing enough as they put it ""adulting"" even though they treat me like a child some others that i know make me feel like they treat me like a child as well."
54261,"""baby"" me if you will alot and get pissy with me if I make a mistake or forget something sometimes for some stuff where as other stuff the don't care."
54262,I often can't tell how they'll react and yet they wonder why I don't come to them.
54263,They scare me sometimes they aren't abusive though psychology maybe.
54264,I talked to a psychologist and from my talks with her I more than likely have sensory processing disorder (spd fir short) and anxiety to some level social.
54265,And I'm afraid that they'll laughably down play that and ignore it and say I don't/didn't need a psychologist.
54266,Amongst some other things.
54267,Like self doubt that I'm trans
54268,"Thank you, I needed it :)"
54269,Thank you very much.
54270,I'm still struggling to get away but it's looking like it could be sooner rather than later.
54271,"No I’m not

I was betrayed by a counsellor and I didn’t really tell anyone about it."
54272,Felt like no one would believe me so I didn’t try.
54273,Just trying to not sink under the anger is all
54274,Thanks mom I guess I needed to get that off my chest.
54275,It's been rough but I think the sun is finally coming out so to speak.
54276,And I will check out that group thank you
54277,Better than Screenshots.
54278,[I have Pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdeptusMechanicus/comments/wnx9tb/princes_of_the_omnissiah_legiones_astartes/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) that I posted over on r/AdeptusMechanicus
54279,"I think that's what it was, that I picked up tensions that they tried to hide or sugarcoat."
54280,"Especially since I was in some very damaging situations all on my own (like bullying, difficult friendgroup,...), Nd never really felt that I could talk to them about it."
54281,And they also didn't really ask.
54282,"Probably because they also didn't know how to handle all of this, but that doesn't make the consequences for me easier to handle."
54283,I'm just glad that I have my own space since a few years and can finally work through my childhood and family stuff in peace... and figure out which things I repressed.
54284,Thank you for your words ♡
54285,"Normally my intrinsic motivation is superb, but atm my whole mindset is a bit off."
54286,"So I guess until I'm feeling a bit better, external motivation it is."
54287,"Such a sweet comment, thank you so much!"
54288,A hug would be nice
54289,"Thanks, mom."
54290,"I heard the phrase, “Ultimately, we become the person who could have saved us that time that no one did.”

I can’t save them all but I can use my hard-earned experience to know exactly what to say to my own ducklings, when they just need to know they’re enough, just as they are."
54291,"I'm sorry to go on and on, I had a lot to vent about I guess."
54292,"Aw, thanks."
54293,"I should've added a /s as well, that was flippant of me."
54294,"I have a great therapist and a very patient wife and I'm slowly learning (at 37) to better articulate my needs and express my emotions in a healthy, kind, and functional way."
54295,But to perhaps add something more constructive to the thread:  this described me to a T as a youth.
54296,"I was a ""good kid,"" I never got in trouble, I never caused any grief, I kept to myself, I entertained myself, etc."
54297,"But I also came from an incredibly chaotic and unstable environment, and no adults around me were interested in my needs, no one healthily expressed emotions, etc."
54298,"So looking back now it's pretty easy to see, ""oh, you very quickly intuited that the people around you weren't interested in your needs or giving you what you needed, and you became very good at avoiding any kind of provocation that you didn't want because of the explosive/violent results if you didn't, and you learned to take care of yourself because if you didn't, no one took care of you, and that's the kind of adult you are."""
54299,"This has profound effects on you as an adult, in your relationships, even just your day to day functioning by yourself."
54300,So yeah.
54301,"I guess at this point I'd be a dad in this sub's context (no kids, just a dog), and so this is partially me saying, ""As that kid who's now an adult, YUP."""
54302,Thanks for the outreach.
54303,💚
54304,Funny thing is I still buy plushies every now and then just because they make me happy.
54305,"Not a very manly thing, although that doesn’t really bother me 90% of the time."
54306,Thanks mom
54307,[removed]
54308,I got two new exam pads and two stacks of pens to  make notes for work.
54309,Right now I think just focusing on work is the way to go
54310,I got two new exam pads and two stacks of pens to  make notes for work.
54311,Right now I think just focusing on work is the way to go
54312,Hugs would be nice.
54313,Thank you
54314,"Thank you for the suggestion

I am diagnosed and have been receiving treatment."
54315,That's part of why I feel like I should be happy now.
54316,No.
54317,I don’t know the first thing about finding the right therapist.
54318,My mom’s mom was very anti-therapy so it feels impossible to open up.
54319,And I feel ashamed talking about this in real life.
54320,"Barely, cause they want 2.5x rent in income."
54321,"Which is fine, but I *just* started a second job and don't have paychecks from that yet."
54322,I really want to live alone but it's not looking feasible.
54323,I make $15/hr at my primary job and $11/hr at an overnight job.
54324,I don't know what else to do at this point.
54325,I left home earlier this year because my mom is a narcissist and I'm tired of relying on others.
54326,"I'm ready to be on my own, but I don't know what else to do."
54327,It’s been a tough year because my 83 yo mother moved next door.
54328,"It’s awoken a lot of long buried pain, so I’ve started seeing a therapist."
54329,The worst part is sitting there listening to her memories of my perfect childhood and her always-perfect behavior.
54330,And how she was unaware of any abuse from either of them.
54331,It’s hard to forgive and be the bigger person when I have to bathe her and listen to her basically discount the childhood my sister and I endured.
54332,Thanks Mom.
54333,I needed that A lot.
54334,😢
54335,"Thank you, your response means a lot."
54336,"Insurance is being messy too, but once that’s squared I’ll pick them up for sure."
54337,"No one has ever described the relief of the meds like you have, even my therapist."
54338,It sounds like heaven to just be calmer and not have panic attacks all the time 🥹
54339,Thank you!
54340,I have two double cousins (father's are twins and so are moms) that are the good cousins.
54341,We are very close and I'm hoping to see them next month and go horse riding!
54342,Thank you.
54343,Thank you for the kind words.
54344,It really is hard
54345,"thank u so so so much, i rly appreciate this comment and i needed this today, i’ll try to come back when i can"
54346,i’m in therapy but it’s been like a month since i went cuz i was out of town.
54347,i’m on mood stabilizers.
54348,i’ve worked on better coping mechanisms like journaling and just generally being a bigger person and walking away when something upsets me or talking rationally with whoever upset me instead of lashing out.
54349,i’m trying *so hard* to be better and i’m scared that it’s not doing anything and that i’m still a bad person.
54350,i don’t want to be that person anymore.
54351,i hurt other people and i wasn’t happy.
54352,but what’s the point of trying to be better if everyone is still going to hate me for my past mistakes anyway..?
54353,"Hey mom :) I thought about following up here instead of creating a post

&#x200B;

My appointment went very well and my therapist even noticed that I looked more rested than the last time we talked."
54354,We're both glad of my progress and even concluded that today's session could be the last!
54355,"My file with my therapist is still open for 60 days if there's anything, so I know the possibility of a quick appointment is still there."
54356,But I do feel like I'm on the right path to help my mental health better.
54357,"The motto for the next few months ""One Step At A Time""."
54358,"&#x200B;

I'll take good care of myself and I also have the support of my amazing boyfriend (+3 years relationship and +6 years friendship)."
54359,Take care of you too!
54360,thank you so much <3 sad that 18 wasn’t what i thought it would be but so damn proud of myself.
54361,excited to start fresh
54362,thank you mom!!!
54363,😌🥰🫂
54364,"I'm moving out of my dads house the end of this week and i'm terrified, I miss my ex, I feel so alone."
54365,Thank you mom.
54366,"I'm so afraid, hurt and the uncertainty is killing me... A hug means the world to me right now."
54367,I'm trying to be strong but still struggling.
54368,I like what I’m learning at school but in my internship I question if this is really for me.
54369,"I’ve always been a more artsy creative person but my mom always told me to go into STEM cause I’m good at math, it makes more money, and I am capable of getting the work done."
54370,Sometimes I wonder if I really like what I do and what I’m doing with my life but I never know the answer.
54371,I’m a go with the flow easygoing girl and I feel like I’m in too deep to quit.
54372,I want to find time and motivation to write stories but I never do.
54373,There’s all these things about myself that make me question if I’m just one big ball of defense mechanisms floating through life and trying to find a solid foot to stand on.
54374,Thanks for the virtual hug :)
54375,thanks!
54376,"i love cats, and i appreciate it :\]

&#x200B;

thank you"
54377,Thank you!❤️😞
54378,"(っ˘̩╭╮˘̩)っ 

Thank you, needed it much lately"
54379,Aww any time!
54380,💙
54381,"Ah, then I can empathize there and it really is the whole enchilada of awful."
54382,Would a virtual hug help in any way?
54383,"If not, totally cool, not everyone feels better after knowing a stranger loves them and wants to give them a good big digitally-enhanced hug."
54384,"But I mean, would it hurt to try?"
54385,"Lame, yes."
54386,But potentially effective.
54387,"I recommend taking the initiative on that and either nagging your dad or making the calls yourself then telling him you’ve found a place (I assume he’ll be paying, so you’ll need to tell him)."
54388,Professional help changes everything.
54389,"Even if the therapy itself doesn’t work for you, having a neutral party who’ll listen without judgement and offer insight when it’s wanted and needed can be so beneficial."
54390,"Plus they can help you get medical diagnoses and medication, if those are things you’re interested in."
54391,"Source: Didn’t think I’d make it to 18, therapy is helping me turn 22 later this year"
54392,Any time.
54393,"If she doesn’t want a daughter, then she doesn’t get one."
54394,"Cutting contact can be very difficult and painful, but consider reducing contact."
54395,"You set the boundaries, you speak with her on your terms, and you establish consequences if she oversteps your boundaries."
54396,"For example, “If you misgender me, I will correct you."
54397,"If you argue with me about it, I’ll walk away and message you when I’m ready and want to."
54398,"Until then, your number will be silenced in my phone and you’re not welcome to reach out to me until I initiate.”"
54399,Yay tea!!
54400,I hope it's delicious and that you have an awesome day.
54401,"Any time, we're always open here."
54402,😁
54403,Or course!
54404,Any time!
54405,Are you sure that's the only solution?
54406,"You know what you'll sacrifice by going home, but what are you willing or able to sacrifice to stay?"
54407,"Have you checked out obscure college scholarships, have you called local charities?"
54408,"Is there any way to take a semester off, work there, save up and return?"
54409,Any other bills are probably not as big of a priority and you can always clean up your credit after you graduate and get that great job.
54410,o((*^▽^*))o
54411,"That's why you found us, you can have this literally any time, just ask."
54412,Mom on demand!
54413,💙🤗
54414,If course!
54415,💙
54416,Yay!
54417,I feel better just knowing that.
54418,🤓
54419,Yay!
54420,I'm so glad.
54421,Please stop by if you need us.
54422,💙
54423,Any time Duck.
54424,💙
54425,"You're very welcome, any time."
54426,😁 we're very flexible on this timeline.
54427,Definitely.
54428,"And I recommend starting with MHUK they should have the best list of resources and that should then help you determine if you need a solicitor, but yeah, I just know how much of a struggle this probably is and I want to make sure you're getting at least the support that's available."
54429,"Good luck and feel free to come here for support too, any time."
54430,"Ah, okay that's totally normal too, it's a trauma response in some cases, but that's not the road you're on now, if that makes sense."
54431,You have gotten into the better path of at least trying.
54432,That's huge.
54433,"And ironically, wanting to protect others even from yourself is highly compassionate of you."
54434,"So, not bad at all!"
54435,"But important to really feel safe with it, so you can actually tackle this problem yourself, by actually making a spreadsheet."
54436,"I know, you were being silly but I'm serious!"
54437,"Every time you talk to her, record data about her response, of her reaction and how much time you took, if she looked or sounded bored, etc."
54438,"The best evidence is evidence that will convince you, and that's usually evidence you gather yourself."
54439,"Once you have a few weeks, look at the data."
54440,Is there's any time you got a bad response?
54441,Any particular time she's always impatient (like maybe her favorite show is on Tuesday night or something and you notice she has less time then?
54442,"), etc."
54443,This can let you relax a little once you've got enough data that you can see you aren't imposing.
54444,Obviously don't get obsessed about the data gathering lol just saying.
54445,"If you need reassurance, this is one way you might be able to get it for yourself, which is super useful."
54446,Any time.
54447,🤓
54448,Any time Duck.
54449,💙
54450,Aww we're so super excited that you're here!
54451,"You'll get through this, that's absolutely true."
54452,Just make sure to grab any support you need along the way here.
54453,No reason it has to be a lonely boring journey!
54454,💙
54455,Yep that's very important and very true.
54456,"You have to be kind to yourself first, that's how you learn to be kind to everyone else."
54457,You're doing great.
54458,💙
54459,Ah a true co-connoisseur!
54460,"Have two they're cheap:

#(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

#(⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃"
54461,"⊂(•‿•⊂ )*.✧

Also I have resources for days."
54462,"Just give me a reasonable amount of time to find them, and then send me a PM and bug me if it's taking longer than your anxiety can tolerate okay?"
54463,"Don't hurt yourself, bug me if I take too long."
54464,🤗
54465,"Of course Ducks, always!"
54466,💙
54467,"Okay, but if it's just a temporary absence, then really you just need to distract yourself temporarily right?"
54468,Do you have any stuff that helps you focus on fun more than the anxiety?
54469,Anything calming?
54470,"Have I got the best thing for you:

#ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ

BAM!"
54471,Bearhug.
54472,Awesome good!
54473,Really proud of you for not getting discouraged!
54474,Good luck.
54475,We're all really hoping for you!
54476,🤗💙
54477,That's good have the hug.
54478,Thank you for letting that out.
54479,～(つˆДˆ)つ｡☆
54480,The username was a bit of a giveaway not gonna lie... 😏😉🥰
54481,I'm glad.
54482,🤓
54483,Awesome.
54484,Any time Duck.
54485,We're here.
54486,(｡♡‿♡｡)
54487,Gotcha.
54488,Positive or negative motivation for external?
54489,(っ.❛ ᴗ ❛.
54490,)っ
54491,Exactly.
54492,Must have heard that same phrase lol.
54493,You go right ahead.
54494,I asked and I'm not leaving here until I've got all of your vent.
54495,I promise.
54496,"Hey, our flair is self edit."
54497,"You can definitely be a ""Dad"" and still mom for a bunch of minutes here."
54498,"We're truly open to everyone, mom, dad, siblings, cousins, the family dog, straight up everyone can be helpful and support our Ducklings."
54499,Just in case you want to!
54500,💙
54501,Nor should it!
54502,Plushier hugs from soft friends are awesome!
54503,"Nothing for you to be sorry about, you didn't do anything wrong by telling someone."
54504,Do you have someone in real life to help you?
54505,Any trustworthy adults?
54506,"That's fair, good focus!"
54507,♥️🤗⊂(◉‿◉)⊂
54508,Meh if you're still in treatment then that's okay to not be feeling the joy yet.
54509,It's pretty common for that kind of thing to take some time.
54510,"Joy is weird, happy is weird, it's kind of like... like a limb that's been asleep for a while, sorta kinda."
54511,"You gotta stretch out the sleepy-numb feeling, get through the mental pins-and-needles, and then you get to use it again."
54512,I believe in you.
54513,"Oh okay, first put that shame down and walk away."
54514,It's toxic and it's not yours and no.
54515,Someone else gave you that and you do not have to carry it another second.
54516,"That's your choice now that you know it's not yours, you don't have any use for it, right?"
54517,"But after that, would you like help finding stuff and info?"
54518,Would you like me to just link you a MH sub here where you can ask questions?
54519,Just tell me what you need Ducks.
54520,Yeah it's unfortunate but that's really the only way.
54521,Work stupidly hard and do it all on your own.
54522,Or roommates?
54523,If they have good boundaries it can be like living alone.
54524,Hmmm I work with caregivers all the time and caregiver burnout is real and dangerous.
54525,"But this sounds more like unresolved resentment so yeah, that's a great call on the therapist either way."
54526,"You have every right to your emotions Duck, just remember to let go of anything that hurts you more than it hurts them."
54527,You don't need to carry anyone's baggage but your own and you can put that down any time your ready.
54528,I'm really proud of you for doing all this hard work under such difficult circumstances.
54529,"She might not accept the blame for what she did, but she also doesn't get any of the credit she didn't deserve for how awesome you are now."
54530,This is all you.
54531,"You're the biggest person anyway because you're motivated by love and kindness, even in the face of this situation."
54532,You're doing great.
54533,Honestly and truly.
54534,Glad to be here for you!
54535,🤗
54536,"I speak from experience, allergy attack included."
54537,"I was so completely chill the whole 911 call, the whole ambulance ride, everyone was terrified and I later thought it was hilarious."
54538,"But yep, a quick shot in the butt and I went home to enjoy the rest of my completely relaxing day."
54539,"Truly, still, one of the most relaxing days of my life."
54540,And the rest of the meds weren't nearly as effective (probably something about the lack of oxygen boosting the effects LOL) BUT they still worked so well that I only took them for about a year.
54541,That's all the time I needed to be able to get a system embedded in my brain to balance things without chemicals to help me.
54542,"Just like taking a cast off, not everyone has to be on every med forever."
54543,"Only the ones you need to be on forever, right?"
54544,And you'll work with your doctor hopefully to fight for that if you want.
54545,"But yeah, my only concern is if it's a benzo, then just make sure to take the minimum you need only when you need so you don't pick up an addiction, cause like who needs that extra hurdle at this point right?"
54546,🤓
54547,That's sweet and awesome and have a great time!
54548,💙
54549,Any time.
54550,We're here if you need support.
54551,Oh of course.
54552,💙
54553,That's only because you're focused on the wrong opinion.
54554,The only one that matters is what you think of yourself.
54555,"Because you're the only one who really had to live with yourself 24/7, right?"
54556,So you have to love yourself and really every other person doesn't mean anything real until you do.
54557,"If you're trying to be better for other people or their approval, it will never work right and you'll be miserable."
54558,Don't hurt yourself like that.
54559,Find a reason to change that is just for you.
54560,Yay!
54561,🤓💙
54562,Any time!
54563,That hug emoji is awesome!
54564,Where'd you find that one?!
54565,🤓
54566,Okay that's usually the anxiety about being alone making it feel awful.
54567,"So, first, you're never truly alone, we're here."
54568,"Now, is there any reason you can't reach out to your ex?"
54569,And are you okay with moving out?
54570,"We're here if you want to talk, feel free to make a post, too, for lots of support."
54571,💙
54572,"That's so big, that kind of fear, I know."
54573,"That's why it's so hard to fight, to struggle, sometimes it's like a riptoe, you have to give into the momentum and pretty much surrender."
54574,At least then you get a chance to breathe and relax your muscles while you find a new path to safety.
54575,Panic is your only enemy when it comes to fear.
54576,"If you can stay calm but afraid, then you can still get yourself safe."
54577,"Have a bunch of hugs and feel free to come here if you need help finding motivation to keep swimming, even if you decide to relax and struggle a little less."
54578,💙
54579,Any time.
54580,Just remember the only reason you don't do what you want is usually because of someone else.
54581,"Just make sure it's a good reason, like your children, not something someone else put on you, right?"
54582,💙
54583,Any time!
54584,💙
54585,Of course Ducks.
54586,Always here for hugs if you need them.
54587,Thank you
54588,"I've already stopped paying on my credit cards,  which sucks but it is what it is."
54589,My phone service has already been disconnected.
54590,My only personal bills are my car insurance and gas.
54591,"I drive over an hour one way to go to my clinical sites, so unfortunately those bills can't be lowered."
54592,"If I take a semester off, that's still being dropped from my program as it's a health science/ clinical rotation."
54593,"They are classes that are only taught once a year and to be accepted into the program is hard, there's only 13 in it currently."
54594,"I spoke with my teacher and if I took the semester off, I would have to reapply to the program and if I wanted to remain at my current progress level, I'd have to retake all of my exams from the previous semesters and all of my clinical competencies to prove I still have my same knowledge base."
54595,"On top of that, i would be set back a whole graduation year."
54596,"Which I wouldn't care about too much, except that means 6 months down the road Uncle Sam comes knocking looking for me to start paying the loans ive already taken out."
54597,"I'm looking for jobs now, and I set up a tuition installment plan."
54598,And at this point I'm just taking it day by day.
54599,I have until the 22nd to pay for my first 400 installment payment.
54600,"Im honestly willing to sacrifice everything possible, I just dont know what's left."
54601,Ive already sold everything of value I own to try and pay this first installment.
54602,Thanks for talking to me mom *hugs*
54603,This is so nice of you to really see right through my sloppy English and determine things I need to hear!
54604,Thank you again!
54605,"Yes, this is from deep sad childhood trauma more likely."
54606,And probably won't ever be resolved.
54607,I need to learn how to form a relationships at least with someone like her.
54608,"And I will try to make some list of our interactions to relax my anxiety, as you recommend."
54609,"I hope I will be able to meet her this week to discuss some job opportunities, because I am useless at choosing ""adult things""."
54610,"Thanks mom
This means alot"
54611,"Not much , I am mother of little toddler and i have barely time to rest or calm myself"
54612,Thank you!
54613,Super cute!
54614,Thank you!
54615,I managed to get $1500 for the car even though its broken.
54616,So that's a start towards a down payment.
54617,I can do it!
54618,😥(つˆДˆ)つ thanks for the hug.
54619,I really appreciate it.
54620,If only hugs could fully heal past trauma that would be great when I get home tonight from work I'm going to probably cry a little while i hug my stuffed animal from both this and the past trauma (つˆДˆ)つ
54621,Also tonight I [custom built a Skitarii Praetorian ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/wpkv4j/i_built_a_skitarii_praetorian_using_a_bunch_of/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
54622,"Positive, please."
54623,I dont want to get punished.
54624,That would make things even worse.
54625,Thank you mum 🥹
54626,[removed]
54627,(っ´▽｀)っ
54628,That's a nice way to think about it.
54629,I'll keep that in mind~
54630,I don’t know what I need.
54631,Turns out there is another reaction to fight or flight.
54632,I don’t do either- I freeze.
54633,When I’m anxious I freeze until it passes.
54634,The roommates are possible.
54635,"I really want my aunt and partner to be able to visit at some point, but I don't know how visitors work well with roommates."
54636,"(My partner is halfway across the US (I'm on east coast) and my aunt is top of the state, so like it'd be once in a year maybe for a few nights.)"
54637,"I just want to be able to afford for them to see me, cause I maybe see my aunt once a year and I miss people."
54638,"If I get a shared apartment, maybe I can save for them to have a hotel while they're here."
54639,"Thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart!"
54640,"It’s been so much harder than I expected, and I appreciate your kind words."
54641,❤️
54642,Hi hi!
54643,"I don’t know if you remember me, but I’m on my third day of Lexapro."
54644,"I know it takes a couple weeks to feel the positive effects, but I’m happy I finally got the journey going."
54645,"It took a lot of nervousness to finally have the courage to take it, and you helped me immensely on finding my motivation."
54646,"I’ve a had little side effects the last two days, but today I feel much better."
54647,"And luckily, no allergies to the meds!"
54648,Thanks so much 💛
54649,"i found it when i searched for ""hug"" on my phone's emoji keyboard :)"
54650,"thank you, I did reach out to my ex and i'm talking to him about my fears, also that I was feeling suicidal."
54651,But I don't think I can tell him how much I miss him and want him back because he's the one who dumped me.
54652,I feel like it's the necessary step for me to move out but I just am so scared
54653,Mom ;\_; I really appreciate the soothing words.
54654,I will do my best to keep swimming.
54655,And I def learned my lesson so it will never happen again.
54656,Thank you so much once again.
54657,"i might cry lmao-

your so much more understanding then my real mom lol"
54658,No prob.
54659,💙
54660,Any time.
54661,Check the debt laws too.
54662,It can be scary to be sued but it literally can't effect student loans like at all.
54663,Check r/studentloansupport (spoiler: I'm a mod there too!
54664,lol).
54665,It's a mental health focused support sub for exactly this kind of stuff.
54666,People there might have unusual suggestions and they definitely know where you've been (as do I!
54667,and you can't have too much help right?
54668,🤗💙
54669,I really hope that helps and please take time here too if you need reassurance about anything!
54670,"Good luck, please let me know how it's going!"
54671,🤗💙
54672,Any time.
54673,We're always open.
54674,💙
54675,So you have a toddler you can focus on!
54676,"That's great, because that's about the most important thing you could be doing with your time right?"
54677,"Rest is definitely important, so it might be good to start with focusing on getting some rest even if it's just a little while she goes to sleep."
54678,Even if it's just a nap that can give you both some real help.
54679,Yay!
54680,That's fantastic!
54681,I'm super excited for you!!!
54682,🤓💙
54683,I completely understand and I wish that works for internet hugs too.
54684,And please feel free to cry it out with a trusted stuffie.
54685,Those things exist for a reason and giving comfort is it  💙
54686,"Awesome, totally understandable."
54687,"So, hey, things are never exactly how we want."
54688,"But by doing the thing now, getting up and doing it, you can have it over and done with, in less than the time it would take to be all anxious or grumpy or bored and then have to do it anyway in a bad mood right?"
54689,Getting it done now still means you have so much time left after for activities!
54690,💙
54691,"Why, any time."
54692,Literally.
54693,💙
54694,Okay so then you should call the emergency service number if you're in danger right?
54695,Awesome.
54696,And fawn.
54697,"Yeah, they now recognize 4F."
54698,So that's okay!
54699,"As long as you don't run, then the anxiety will eventually go down and then you can think again, right?"
54700,"Just take your time, this won't go away."
54701,Just make a note when you think of something and then reply here when you got one?
54702,:)
54703,That makes sense to me!
54704,"Plus they might like to have their own space, feel more like a vacation!"
54705,But that's obviously something to discuss with them.
54706,I'm just glad you're really considering all your options.
54707,Always here if you need them.
54708,💙
54709,Of course I remember!
54710,"I'm so glad you didn't have any allergies, and minimal side effects is outstanding news."
54711,Have a huge virtual hug because you did the thing and you're a badass!!
54712,💙🤗
54713,"That's probably because that's too much to put on someone who already couldn't be what you needed, or they wouldn't be an ex right?"
54714,Are you getting real help on those feelings?
54715,That's only because I'm just an older version of you most likely.
54716,You'll be this kind too when you're all healed up and ready to help others because you know how much it sucks to be alone Ducky.
54717,And even if that means you only understand one person you'll already be better than your real mom was to you.
54718,Totes already better than her because you can still accept love!
54719,💙🥰🤗
54720,Its him and he sleeps when I am at work.
54721,I started to work and my father watch him during day before I come home.
54722,Sometimes I am so overwhelmed.
54723,"I work as social worker at hospital 

."
54724,Thank you so much.
54725,That was actually really nice.🙂
54726,"If they came, they'd be in the bedroom by themselves."
54727,I wouldn't force them to share.
54728,My partner obviously wants to cuddle but I'll also see if I can afford better by next year with more time for my job to kick in.
54729,"In the mean time, I'll try for a roommate."
54730,And who knows - maybe a roommate would be okay with a few nights.
54731,"Not likely, but possibly maybe."
54732,Thank you!
54733,🤗💙
54734,so basically I drove him away
54735,"thank you<333

&#x200B;

prolly gonna go cry now lmao-"
54736,As a SW you must have your own therapist and EAP?
54737,Do they have any daycare or child care support?
54738,Of course.
54739,And if it's not enough just let me know.
54740,💙
54741,"I certainly would accommodate a roommate like that, so yeah, trying to find someone who is easy going might work."
54742,Just remember to offer the same courtesy back where you can.
54743,You'll do great either way.
54744,Oh sadly no.
54745,Daycare will be from September.
54746,I'd easily offer the same back.
54747,I'm kinda the ghost roommate.
54748,You won't know I'm there.
54749,"It's how I feel safest - or it's a trauma response, idk."
54750,It's a traumatic response thing.
54751,Lol.
54752,Congratulations to you and your spouse!
54753,"You look so happy and I have to say, lovely wedding attire!"
54754,I'm sorry it took so long to post the photos I promised it's been an eventful few weeks.

55001,Your dress is literally gorgeous on you omg ♡
55002,Canberra Australia ☺️
55003,It’s so sweet how they match!
55004,I think that’s such an awesome thing to have matching accents ❤️
55005,Came here to say this!
55006,I’m in awe of her dress as well.
55007,It’s beautiful and gives me fairy tale vibes
55008,Lovely!
55009,!
55010,grrrr.
55011,"I'm at the park rn tho, I'll drink the water, but the A/C filter has to wait til I get home... if i remember it😆"
55012,"But... but I have no AC, I wish I had though."
55013,"D: Yet I really do need to drink, that reminder really came in handy."
55014,Instructions unclear.
55015,Drank the water pooling in my AC.
55016,"Just kidding, this is good advice."
55017,I checked my kid’s portable (floor) AC in their room yesterday and turns out the darn thing had water that hadn’t been properly drained and had started leaking all over the floor.
55018,"So check your AC reservoir too, if you have one."
55019,Thanks MamaBear ❤️ good advice.
55020,I just changed my AC and water filters and got a big glass of fresh water.
55021,.... what and where is the AC filter
55022,Thanks Mom!
55023,A warning light was on and I hadn't noticed.
55024,"Filter cleaned, iced hibiscus tea retrieved ☺️"
55025,"I already cleaned it yesterday, Mama!"
55026,"Brand new AC, but my old man cat likes to sit on it and get chilly so he can go warm his ancient kitten bones in the sun, so the red light came on saying it was full of fur and time to run it under a faucet!"
55027,"I will go drink some water, though, thank you Mama."
55028,Take the opportunity and check your dryer filter as well.
55029,"Its cold , can I have tea instead ?"
55030,"Welp, I need new ac filters now."
55031,"I just changed my filter on the first, so it's still good."
55032,I did hydrate!
55033,Thank you!
55034,Thank you.
55035,Ordered new filters.
55036,They’ll be here on Sunday
55037,I washed mine before firing the ACs up this year.
55038,Hot soapy water and a sponge make quick work of the dust.
55039,"Buy spray on coil cleaner if the AC is musty, follow the directions and YouTube if you get stuck."
55040,And keep the unit tipped back slightly.
55041,I've seen so many problems started by people tipping the AC forward making the water drain inside.
55042,"I need to drink even more water now, spiro is no joke"
55043,"Lpt..figure out how often you are supposed to replace your ac filters, then subscribe to a subscription of your air filter, so it just shows up at your door and you know it's time to change it."
55044,This is what I do.
55045,"And thank you mama for reminding me, but there isn't one at my door so it isn't time yet."
55046,"JUST had mine replaced last week, that’s why the AC wasn’t working!"
55047,lol thank Momma Bear!
55048,!
55049,Thanks mom!
55050,"I'll drink some ice water, but I have no AC in this apartment."
55051,I will however ensure fans are clean.
55052,Thank you Mama bear!
55053,"I'm currently eating my Greek chicken salad, I have a huge glass of water and husband keeps a close eye on the filters because I have asthma and our state catches on fire every summer."
55054,Drank my water.
55055,Husband just changed the filters last week.
55056,love you too Mom!
55057,Checked mine just the other day
55058,"Oh right, new filters showed up earlier."
55059,I would have forgotten!
55060,💜💜💜
55061,Thanks mom but I don't have an AC any tips to stay fresh/ not too hot ?
55062,Haha thanks mom!
55063,I changed it last month so I think we're still good.
55064,But I will drink some water <3
55065,We don't have AC - house built in 1850 provides coolness as long as your damn granddaughter quits opening windows 😂
55066,Thank you mama bear!
55067,"Changed my ac filter on the 2nd, although I checked it today to make sure it didn't fall because my ac isn't working properly."
55068,Some water sounds good right now.
55069,I think I will have a glass.
55070,Thanks for the reminder!
55071,"I think my brother checked it the other day bc before even tho it was blowing it was hot in the house but then that cold air type smoke (like when you breathe outside in winter) started coming out of it and now it’s back cold in the house

Also ion know about the water part"
55072,"Also, always keep your a/c filter measurements in your phone or in the cloud, so you can always access and check them if you happen to think about replacements while you're already at the hardware store."
55073,Yes mama bear.
55074,Thank you for reminding me.
55075,I have forgotten to drink enough water today.
55076,❤️❤️
55077,I’m always on top of mine !
55078,In fact got a new filter yesterday!
55079,So thanks mama bear we must be on the same wavelength!
55080,I just cleaned my air filters last night!
55081,Thanks for the reminder!
55082,!
55083,Will drink the water but feeling too sick to clean the filters
55084,"The photos look like the filter to an air purifier, not an AC unit."
55085,Good advice nontheless
55086,I do this on the solstice and exquinox’s
55087,RemindMe!
55088,1 hour 30 minutes “check AC filter”
55089,"I don't know how to check the filter yet, but I'll go get a glass of water."
55090,Thanks Mama Bear.
55091,This mom asks you all to please clean your ceiling fans.
55092,People tend to not see how dusty they are when they’re constantly moving.
55093,"Omg, Mom, you're such an hinchapelotas."
55094,"🙄

I'm not going to do any of those things, because it's winter here (which you'd literally know if you paid ANY attention to me AT ALL), but I'll set an alarm to check my filters tomorrow, and buy batteries for the remote for my heater, is that OK with you?"
55095,Is that enough?
55096,Are you happy now?
55097,"(aside from the ""full teenager experience,"" thank you for this, I really should buy batteries for my heater remote, so thank you for reminding me to take care of myself and my house."
55098,You are awesome.)
55099,Don’t have AC but thank you for reminding me to drink water 💜
55100,Drank the water checked ac filters
55101,Thanks I always forget to drink water lol
55102,Ugh.
55103,I can’t wait till I’m 18.
55104,Jk!
55105,Yes!
55106,Will check ‘em!
55107,Thanks
55108,I’m too afraid to ask….where is my AC filter?
55109,?
55110,I’ll do this if you wash your lint trap screen with  hot soapy water and vacuum out the dryer exhaust vent.
55111,I don’t want your cool house to burn down.
55112,I just changed the filter this weekend but I will work on the water drinking
55113,My husband has a recurring task on his phone for once a month.
55114,Yes do it!
55115,And drink 💦
55116,"Damn mom, I just got comfy."
55117,I’m doing it though!
55118,!
55119,New filters arrived yesterday!
55120,Put the last of the old ones in last week.
55121,Making a big jar of ice water now.
55122,"Thanks, Mom!"
55123,"I love you, too!"
55124,❤️
55125,thanks momma 💛
55126,"Thanks Mama, I keep forgetting to change my AC filter."
55127,I’ll set a reminder.
55128,I thought these were all carpet swatches at first
55129,"Thank you, mama."
55130,"Love you ma 🥺 I change mine every 3 months with a decent filter, helps so much with allergies."
55131,Thank you ❤️
55132,How do we clean them
55133,"I wish I had filters to change 😥 old house with no AC here, one of my dreams is to renovate it and add central air."
55134,Mama where do I find it?
55135,Well I can drink water but step dad takes care of the air filters and we dont get along so 1 out of 2 aint bad right?
55136,😁 😂
55137,My husband changed ours tonight and it was disgusting too!
55138,Like how is it so gross!?
55139,We change regularly.
55140,I don’t have ac but I’ll drink to that
55141,*nervous laugher because I don't even know what a AC is*
55142,Thanks!
55143,"Fortunately I did just clean mine a few days ago, and my AC has an indicator light when the filter needs cleaned."
55144,A reminder is always appreciated though.
55145,😊
55146,My AC doesn’t even work :( altho this reminds me that I need to check my cars air filters.
55147,Definitely gonna do this first thing tomorrow!
55148,Got my water now though!
55149,RemindMe!
55150,"10 hours ""check A/c filter"""
55151,I have central air so idk if it has filters that need to be changed
55152,"Also, if you have a dehumidifier in your basement, be sure to clean *its* filter once in a while too—they can get clogged up and then kill the motor."
55153,Ok fine I’ll drink water but if I touch the air filter my stepdad will yell at me again and I hate when he yells
55154,Do you know what I'm supposed to do with them?
55155,I have a wall thing in my apartment and they look super dirty but they've got trim on them like they're not supposed to be thrown away.
55156,I think I'm supposed to clean them but I don't have any idea how you do that.
55157,"Ahh geeze, thanks ma!"
55158,Appreciate the reminder
55159,Thanks!
55160,I always forget to drink enough!
55161,:) I’m getting drunk after I google if my ac has a filter and where to find it!
55162,"ETA: not getting drunk, getting A drink 😅

Update: it has two filters and I now know how to get them out for cleaning!"
55163,"Also husband knew where they were and how to get them out, at least one of them, but he was in the shower and I have no patience!"
55164,So now I also know!
55165,Off to get water!
55166,"I did the ac filter last night, when the bucket it drains into overflowed."
55167,Thanks Mom!
55168,❤️
55169,Set a reminder on your phone.
55170,Every three months.
55171,"Inexpensive filters work just as well as the more expensive ones, they are also less strain on your HVAC system."
55172,Source: Heating and Air employee
55173,My filter light came on after only two months of use.
55174,Are filters universal?
55175,"I assume I can get them at a place like Lowes, correct?"
55176,AC filters are no joke.
55177,Our house they didn’t use one for YEARS and I literally had to PEEL dirt and hair and trash off the condenser coils.
55178,We’re still waiting to get the leak it caused repaired
55179,Check that dishwasher filter too!
55180,!
55181,Consider it done mama
55182,"I'd check my ac filters, if I had a ac to begin with."
55183,"Got fans going, so there's that."
55184,"Took care of it yesterday, Mom!"
55185,Love you too!
55186,Thanks mom.
55187,I appreciate you :)
55188,Use the reminder bot😁
55189,What else has filters in your house?
55190,Bathroom extractor fan?
55191,"That's what I'm about to do (winter here, son't need to worry about the AC), now that I stop and realise the damn thing has been up there over a decade and I don't know that it's ever been done..."
55192,If you have a fan clean the blades (while it is off)
55193,"If you have an air conditioner, it would depend on what kind you have."
55194,Window unit: it's usually on the inside side.
55195,"There's usually a front panel to remove, then take out the filter and wash or replace depending on whether it's disposable or not."
55196,Central a/c is a filter usually behind a large air return in the wall.
55197,(The place where air gets sucked in rather than blown out) This is usually in a hallway somewhere or in the ceiling.
55198,There are usually nuts that get loosened then the panel swings open or comes off.
55199,Be sure to use the old filter measurements (usually on the side of the old filter).
55200,These have to be changed at least every 3 months for proper functioning of both your air conditioner and your lungs.
55201,"If you forget to change them regularly, the first thing you'll notice is how dusty your place suddenly gets!"
55202,"If I'm not sure when the last time the filter was changed, say after I move into a new place, I'm probably going to give it only a month before changing out with a new one."
55203,Pro tip: more expensive does not mean a better filter.
55204,"For proper functioning of the air conditioning unit, usually the cheaper ones work best because they allow for better airflow."
55205,"Use the allergy ones if you need to, but know that it will probably put a strain on your air conditioning system."
55206,Edit: be sure to notice the arrows on the new filter!
55207,They'll tell you which way the filter goes (it only goes one way).
55208,"The arrows point in the direction of airflow, so on an air return, the arrows should point toward the hole you're filling with the filter."
55209,"Edit 2: if you didn't know about air filters, and you're changing yours after years, prepare to FREEZE once your new filter is on!"
55210,Things are going to be much cooler from now on!
55211,"(Oh and set yourself a reminder for 3 months from now)

Edit 3: Don't try to be clever, Dear, and leave the filter off."
55212,"Trust me, you need it."
55213,;)
55214,Do you have an AC unit?
55215,"If so, the bit on the wall inside will have filters in it that need cleaning occasionally or they get full of dust and gunk and the AC doesn't work as well as it should :-)"
55216,That sounds good
55217,And (if you have one) your car's two filters - cabin and engine!
55218,Green tea is very cleansing
55219,This is how we do it.
55220,Its the only way my ADHD brain remembers.
55221,Those are before and after AC wall unit filters

55233,RemindMe!
55234,"10 minutes ""check A/c filter"""
55235,Or vacuum filter!
55236,There's usually TWO on the vacuum!
55237,Or the range hood over the stove!
55238,Many people don't know there's one there.
55239,Your car air cabin filter.
55240,No one ever changes those.
55241,Microwave if it's an above stove top wall mount.
55242,"Those need decreased to clean, though."
55243,"Kapai fellow kiwi, excellent advice!"
55244,"I get you, I also just wanted to miss an AC in my apartment as it still gets really warm for our standards - but AC's aren't really standard equipment in germany."
55245,;)
55246,Is air filter separate from the AC filter?
55247,I have central AC and I know to change the air filter but have never heard anything about the AC unit
55248,"Heck yeah, lots of health perks too."
55249,Try it out
55250,Oh like a window unit?
55251,Now I see it.
55252,I have one in my workshop so I don’t relate it to in-home AC.
55253,In my house our HVAC is in the attic/ ceiling and I have an air purifier in the house.
55254,did you check the filter??

55259,This is magic!
55260,😮
55261,and your dryer vent can get clogged with lint if you don’t clean it with every load!
55262,"Ah yes, the car air filter."
55263,Right!
55264,Yes!
55265,Who would forget those!
55266,Erm ...
55267,I'm just popping out to the garage for a ... thing.
55268,Be right back :-)
55269,"Well, if you take your car in for maintenance regularly they should do it for you."
55270,"My repairman does it for the cost of the filter only (as long as I’m, you know, getting other work done)."
55271,"No, that's what Mama Bear is referring to."
55272,"Although, if you own your home, you may want to check on whether there is a secondary filter inside the unit itself (the part in the attic)."
55273,Some (all?)
55274,central air conditioners have an internal filter there.
55275,"If you're having your unit regularly maintained by a professional, they may be changing that out then."
55276,"It requires taking your a/c apart, so it's certainly not meant to be done as regularly as the filter you're talking about."
55277,"When someone charges the unit with freon, you could have them answer questions about that."
55278,Yes a 6000 BTU unit
55279,There are two filters.
55280,The air intake that's in the engine compartment.
55281,It's easy access and can be changed when they fill your oil.
55282,That's the one most people think of when you think of an air filter in your car.
55283,This filters the air that goes into your engine.
55284,"The cabin air filter is in the dash, you have to take the glove box out to access it."
55285,Most people have no idea that the ac has its own filter.
55286,If you take it to a place that you can stay in the car while they service it and you don't see them in your passenger seat pulling the glove box out it wasn't replaced.
55287,"If you see ""cabin air filter"" on your itemized receipt you're paying for a part you didn't get."
55288,"If it's a place you drop it off or sit in the waiting room while it's serviced, and see that line item ask to check your car, pull the glove box out and check to see if it's new."
55289,"It's fairly easy, open the glove department, look for little buttons or slides on the sides or back of the glove box, push those and it should just fall off."
55290,You'll see the back of the ac and you'll see where the filter goes.
55291,"If you have a secondary AC filter, which the AC people change..."
55292,They have told me to no longer use a filter at the intake airflow vent area.
55293,So now it's basically just a giant hole.
55294,They said putting a second filter there is bad and restricts airflow too much or something.
55295,"But I don't know, I really hate the idea that there is basically a huge hole uncovered behind the grating."
55296,Does this seem right to you?
55297,I'm just asking because you seem to know things.
55298,Anyone can chime in if they have insight though.
55299,Thanks.
55300,Congratulations!!
55301,"That's wonderful, honey."
55302,I'm so proud of you.

55421,P.S.
55422,"I'm just here because of r/All, but now I have a question."
55423,"Is your name *finstant* noodles, or *f* instantoodles?"
55424,"I love the 2nd one, she's really happy and it's the morning here right now, I like seeing happy people in the morning"
55425,Yess!
55426,"If you've grown up with abuse, especially non-physical abuse, or emotional neglect, it can be hard to even know what GOOD is."
55427,"It's easy to see when someone makes a physical action, but much harder to see when someone is neglecting, manipulating, exploiting, or devaluing you."
55428,It's not your fault if you don't understand that you are being hurt.
55429,How could you if no one has ever shown you good treatment?
55430,"Please love and be patient with yourself as you learn (often through trial and error) what healthy relationships look like, and grow into healthy boundaries."
55431,I have a friend who left her first husband because he hit her.
55432,"She stayed too long with her second husband because ""he's only mean, at least he doesn't beat me""."
55433,"We had many conversations where I tried to convince her that second husbands behaviours wasn't ok. She finally kicked him out, he's a crappy ex and terrible co-parent but my friend is thriving on her own."
55434,"She's doing all the things (pizza night, outlandish Xmas decorations etc) that second husband considered to be uncouth."
55435,It's lovely to watch her discover her true self.
55436,it took me a long time to realize just because he didn't abuse me doesn't make the relationship healthy
55437,Thanks mom :')
55438,You deserve the best person for you.
55439,The person who sees your worth.
55440,Don't ever settle.
55441,This hits home.
55442,My mom has had abusive and abrasive partners as long as I have been alive.
55443,"They have progressively gotten less bad, but I still see her suffer."
55444,I inherited her rose colored lenses.
55445,Trying to break the cycle of settling….
55446,I would with people who are changing professions and this is so incredibly prevalent in most of my conversations with people.
55447,"As a reminder- Just because someone employs you does not give them the right to abuse you, your time, or your effort."
55448,Your worth as a human being is intrinsic and they cannot buy the ability to dehumanize you.
55449,"You are worth being treated with care and consideration, always."
55450,ALWAYS.
55451,didnt have to come at me like that 🥲
55452,"I like to ask for a 2nd opinion on something, eg."
55453,"because I have had a lot of anxiety, & depression, I like to make sure that my cognitive distortions aren't affecting my judgement."
55454,"You know, like when you ask someone to look over an email before you click ""send"" to make sure it says what you meant to say."
55455,"Anyhow, when I ask my husband whether I should do something he says, ""you should do whatever you want"" and I find it so empowering, compared to all the knee jerk criticism that comes from my family."
55456,"tysm mom, you always wit the good advice"
55457,Thank you!
55458,❤️
55459,YES
55460,And it doesn't have to be physical to be abuse.
55461,Verbal and emotional abuse exist and are very nearly as insidious as physical abuse.
55462,I've gotten a lesson I never wanted on the latter due a very bad mess in my family I just became aware of 2 1/2 years ago.
55463,It is NEVER OK and NEVER on the victim.
55464,Anyone who blames the victim is a human piss stain I want nothing to do with.
55465,In grad school I told my therapist about an uncomfortable situation in my academic department and she was surprised at how well I was handling it.
55466,"My response was “oh this is nothing, I’ve been in way more toxic environments than this.” She just goes “…you know that’s not a good thing, right?”

Two semesters later I was forced out of the program for advocating for my medical needs."
55467,"Anecdote:
Lots of abuse = high abuse tolerance = low bar of standards."
55468,Took a whole year to realise.
55469,Sheesh.
55470,comparison is the thief of joy.
55471,"not only when you compare good things with better things, but when you compare bad things with terrible things."
55472,don't get stuck with the bad things just because you're used to the terrible things.
55473,Especially cuz if you reproduce with them you are stuck with them and now your kid is exposed to it too
55474,Good one
55475,This is a riff on [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)).
55476,"If you set a high expectation, a slightly less good result can feel like a loss."
55477,"If you have a very low expectation, anything above can feel like a win."
55478,It impacts our lives in a million ways we don't perceive.
55479,For anyone who identifies with this (i.e.
55480,"staying in toxic relationships because they're slightly less horrible than your last one), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be really helpful in untangling negative belief systems that consistently undermine your quality of life."
55481,"You are worthwhile and deserving and should have a life that's more than ""not horrible."""
55482,You are a good friend.
55483,I wish both of you good futures
55484,It's taken me a long time to understand how this can apply to jobs.
55485,"Today is my first day unemployed in over a year, it's tough to swallow but I've realized I'm worth more than how I was treated & didn't let them manipulate me into staying when they suddenly recognized my worth."
55486,I'm looking forward to finding an employer that will respect my time & effort without as much sacrifices.
55487,For now I'll take the time to heal my mind & body before finding something new.
55488,I now realize no job is worth physical & financial pain.
55489,This is so tough.
55490,Isn't that nuts when someone trusts and respects you?
55491,Never gets old.
55492,"And I came by all of it the hard way, kiddo"
55493,[deleted]
55494,Honestly I appreciate it so much and I don't take it for granted.
55495,I am used to being judged automatically
55496,naming the problem is the first step to fixing it.
55497,You look gorgeous!
55498,And I wish I had those eyeliner skills!
55499,"Hey punkin, you are actually pretty every day!"
55500,"Strut your stuff, gorgeous!"
55501,Iknow it's hard sometimes to not to be critical of yourself.
55502,"Everyone sees their own imperfections, and those perceived imperfections feel like they're glaringly obvious to those around us."
55503,All I see is a genuine beauty.
55504,"Be yourself, babylove."
55505,You are so very lovely.
55506,"Sib, you are *gorgeous*!"
55507,😍
55508,"Well, sweety, that’s because you *are* pretty."

55517,Whoever messed with your self esteem DOES NOT MATTER since they didn’t have your best interest at heart.
55518,"You are very pretty…stand tall, be proud of who you are, and always be kind."
55519,You're adorable!!
55520,And WOW your skin is amazing!

55527,You are rocking this look!
55528,Awww!!!
55529,"So, *so* pretty!"
55530,The tone of the makeup you chose complements the outfit you're wearing perfectly - just one step past a natural look.
55531,"**Great** aesthetic, kiddo."
55532,"Great balance, great eye for style."
55533,Impeccable ensemble.
55534,And is that the little heart stamp on your cheek?
55535,Did you do that on the first try?
55536,?
55537,I hope you realize that you are beautiful every day

55741,Thank you!
55742,🖤
55743,How should I do my eyeliner?
55744,"Honey, you are so very welcome."
55745,Please know that you're not alone in feeling this way.
55746,"I'm 50 and I have only just now begun to realize how little of a fuck it matters what other people think about me... how I look, my opinions, my lifestyle... 

*I'm* important to me."
55747,*I'm* beautiful to me.
55748,My happiness means more to me than if some rando thinks I'm pretty or thin or whatever.
55749,"Again, I know it can be hard to be okay with who you are."
55750,Try to remember that no one is keeping score but you.
55751,"If you are a winner in your book, then others will see you as a winner too."
55752,"All that said, very honestly, you are truly a lovely looking young lady."
55753,"Find something about yourself that you believe is gorgeous -- your eyes, your hair, your shoulders, whatever!"
55754,-- and focus on rocking that.
55755,"That will help boost your confidence, which will, in turn, make you feel prettier overall."
55756,"Most importantly, be easy on yourself."
55757,"The world can be so harsh, give yourself the permission to love every little imperfection."
55758,"It makes you *you*, and *you* are beautiful."
55759,"You should have been told this thousands of times, growing up."
55760,Do not sell yourself short.
55761,"Do not settle for the first dickweed (sorry, this is absolutely how I would talk to my grown up kids, I’ve got a potty mouth) that comes along and pays you attention."
55762,"You are beautiful, make up or no make up."
55763,Do whatever the hell you want with your hair.
55764,I think you might have curls.
55765,Embrace them!
55766,"Your eyes, overall features and your smile, as demure as it may be, they’re beautiful."
55767,"I don’t know how went out of their way to knock you down, but those idiots were assholes."
55768,"The only thing missing in this picture, is a fierce sense of confidence."
55769,"What all of us mommas can see so clearly, you’ve got to embrace yourself."
55770,"And that will take time, and effort."
55771,To undo something takes a lot of effort.
55772,But trust me.
55773,I don’t lie.
55774,I hate lying.
55775,"And I am telling you: 

You are beautiful."
55776,Just rest in the certainty that who you are SHINES when you're calm.
55777,Xo from a granny
55778,You're welcome sweetie.
55779,Youre beautiful x
55780,You ARE!
55781,You just can’t see it like we can.
55782,🥰
55783,"BRAVO, my girl!"
55784,I would have remnants of heart attempts all over my face.
55785,Prolly lookin' like somebody gave me a black eye.
55786,LOL  I hope you had a good day.
55787,Did you get any compliments?
55788,Tell yourself every day.
55789,I’m telling you now.
55790,"Me too sweetheart, because it’s true."
55791,I hope you can realise that you with make up only looks pretty cause you are pretty.
55792,Being honest here- not just momming- you ARE very pretty.
55793,It can be hard to see our own beauty because society tells we aren’t allowed to own it (a confident woman is a dangerously powerful thing) and there’s pictures everywhere telling us all about what we lack because capitalism runs on wounded self esteem telling us we need the next thing to become whole or good enough.
55794,"But trust me, you are quite beautiful."
55795,"You have lovely soulful eyes, a perfect nose and gorgeous lips."
55796,And don’t get me started on your luminously glowing skin!
55797,I hope some day soon Sweetling that you can look in the mirror and like what you see every time.
55798,of course friend!
55799,ngl you look kinda like my older sibling
55800,"Well you have a really nice, almond-ish eye shape."
55801,Try to elongate your eye!
55802,"Go more tame on your eye lids, just extend, and an inner corner would make you slay!"
55803,"You are really pretty, you have nice features, extend on that!"
55804,"There are plenty of tutorials online, just exercise and see what fits your eye shape."
55805,"I sucked ass at first too, how I've gotten slightly better haha."
55806,"I you wanna talk, hmu!"
55807,"I will, thank you so much ❤️"
55808,This is a beautiful comment
55809,❤️
55810,"No, it doesn’t matter to me though, I just want to look pretty for my boyfriend, it’s his shirt too"
55811,I’ve always lived thick eyeliner since I’m into the gothic style :)
55812,"First, I'll never reveal my sources, but I happen to know you got *several* compliments on your perfectly winged liner, so nice try, Miss Humble."
55813,"Secondly, I can't explain why, but it makes me so proud to hear you say you only have one person you care to look pretty for."
55814,"As you get more comfortable with it, you'll be able to add one more person to that checklist."
55815,"And then before much longer, she'll be the one that matters the most on that list."
55816,(...you...I'm talking about you.
55817,Did that come through okay?
55818,Geez..awkward mom moment.)
55819,"Finally, you shall never return that shirt to him."
55820,Unless he needs it on a long trip away from you to remind him of your scent.
55821,Yours now.
55822,It suits you too well.
55823,I so decree.
55824,The end.
55825,Thick eyeliner looks bomb when done right.
55826,Try to go less round and less on the eyelids tho I always have crazy eyeliner on.
55827,"I think it’s okay the way it is, well with my style."
55828,"my sister does the same way and I feel so pretty with it so thick because I look so plain without it, I’ll take it into consideration though!"
55829,Thank you :)
55830,It's always hard to be the one left behind.
55831,"If it's any comfort, I'm sure her last days were fantastic ones, and her only regret would be leaving you alone."
55832,"I third, fourth, fifth or anything else the calls that you should seek therapy."
55833,"This is incredibly hard, and you shouldn't have to navigate it alone."
55834,"One thing to remember is that whatever you're feeling, *everything* you're feeling, it's ok to feel that way."
55835,"Even if you're *angry* it's ok. You've suffered a terrible blow, and you're the one who has to go on, and the universe has not been kind to you this week past."
55836,"Anger's one of the stages of grief, and it doesn't mean you don't love her (I'm not saying ""loved"" because you *still* love her."
55837,She's gone but that love remains.)
55838,All anger means is that you're suffering and wish you could find some way to make it hurt less.
55839,"You'll go through a lot of grief stages, and probably circle back around to a few several times."
55840,It's ok to be devastated.
55841,"Don't be devastated alone, though."
55842,"It's tempting to shut out the world like this but I repeat, seek therapy, and keep seeking it if the first therapist isn't a good fit."
55843,(It can happen!)
55844,Hi.
55845,Im so sorry for your loss.
55846,I lost my fiancee 6 years ago.
55847,He was 29.
55848,He was my only person as I do not keep in touch with my family.
55849,My friends struggled to help me.
55850,I tried counselling amd ended up in a hospital feeling totally alone.
55851,I would have never expected that his mom would become my dearest friend.
55852,"We still speak daily, today about everything but back then about him."
55853,She was the only one to understand my loss.
55854,She is the only one I can still talk about him today as she understands he still is important.
55855,She reminds me of him and tolerates my shitty sense of humour cause its exactly like his.
55856,I needed a safe space and she needed someone who would remember him with her.
55857,I didnt know her when he died.
55858,And I would have never expect her to become my family.
55859,"Maybe it sounds odd but if you too do not have anyone, maybe one of your fiancee's loved ones would need you and you could have a space to cherish her."
55860,Its good to feel needed and valued by someone who loved her.
55861,Dear One.
55862,"My daughter died from an aneurysm 4 years ago She was 39 , and left her life partner behind."
55863,"I don't know exactly what you are going through, but in a way I understand."
55864,We've both lost someone.
55865,"I'm not your mother, but I was someone's mother."
55866,It seems that you are short a mother.
55867,Maybe I can offer you some internet love and support.
55868,Your a strong person to take care of yourself all this time.
55869,You know what a gift it is to truly love and be loved.
55870,That memory can help carry you through.
55871,Please take care of you.
55872,"I'm so sorry, sweetheart."
55873,r/widowers has been a big support for me after losing my person.
55874,Please try to drink water and sleep.
55875,"This is a horrible journey, but you are not alone."
55876,Sending hugs across the internet to you.
55877,💔
55878,I'm so sorry for your loss.
55879,Please contact a friend.
55880,Did Emma have family that would talk this through with you?
55881,I am so incredibly sorry for your loss.
55882,I echo what another poster said about contacting a therapist.
55883,You may find r/griefsupport to be a place for you to find support.
55884,I am very sorry for your loss
55885,Oh.
55886,Please do not think there is a timeline and you should feel 'somehow' by 'then/now'.
55887,Ever.
55888,"If someone makes you feel this way, don't waste your time on them."
55889,PTSD associated with sudden loss is different for everyone.
55890,"Please, do not solely focus on grief stages, be aware its normal for you to feel all other emotions du to shock and potentially trauma."
55891,Be kind to yourself.
55892,Its not a regular grief.
55893,It hits different and its normal.
55894,Find your glbtq Centre and see if they have a therapist.
55895,There are usually grief counsellors at community mental health centres (Canada) best of luck wherever you are.
55896,I am so sorry for your loss - and so very happy that she was so loved and cherished before she had to leave you.
55897,"Gentle hugs, duckling."
55898,"My cousin lost her love to an aneurysm very young, a month after their child was born."
55899,"It was decades ago, but I've seen how her life trajectory changed."
55900,My heart aches for the pain you're going through.
55901,It can be so hard when you can see the life you want and then life takes a massive curve.
55902,"When I (only child, separated from toxic parents) lost my ex-wife due to a separation I didn't see coming and didn't understand..."
55903,It was really hard to figure out who I was and what my life could look like without her in it.
55904,Give yourself time and space to process your grief over her passing and mourn the life you won't have.
55905,"She had died, but your future with her is no longer there either, so you're grieving for yourself too."
55906,You're grieving both things.
55907,And that's okay.
55908,"When the time is right, cherish and remember the good memories you made together."
55909,"The sharp pain of your double loss is going to be overwhelming for a long while, but it will fade to be less painful."
55910,"Best advice I can give: 

1."
55911,"No new relationships for at least a year, maybe even two."
55912,Figure out who you are and what you want without another person there to influence you.
55913,2.
55914,Keep yourself busy.
55915,Make a plan to sign up for a spring semester adult education class.
55916,Buy a guitar or ukulele and take lessons in person or via an app.
55917,Practice solving a Rubik's cube until you can solve the whole thing without looking at the steps to solving it.
55918,Learn a new language through Duolingo.
55919,Journal.
55920,Participate in NaNoWriMo in November and write a book.
55921,Im so sorry for your loss.
55922,This hits so close to me.
55923,Back in 2009 my brother who was 28 died at work from a brain aneurysm.
55924,Like he was the kind of guy to run marathons and was healthy as can be.
55925,Just one day he dropped to the ground and he was gone.
55926,Ive been told there was no way he was able to feel pain because he was gone in a instant.
55927,Im not gonna lie and say its going to be easy dealing with this.
55928,My family never recovered from his loss because it was so sudden and tragic.
55929,I was 15 years old when it happened and it was my first real experience with death.
55930,My parents put me in therapy but the hole in my heart from his loss never closed.
55931,All my family has now are memories and photographs.
55932,My oldest sons middle name is named after his uncle that he was never able to meet.
55933,"Cherish the memories and know that even though they are gone, they went knowing they were so loved."
55934,I’m so sorry.
55935,"If you need someone to talk to, PM me."
55936,=hug=
55937,I am so sorry for your loss sweetie.
55938,"Please reach out to anyone you can, you should not be alone."
55939,"If you work, your job might provide health benefits that include therapy, or an EAP (employee assistance program) that might be able to help."
55940,I am sending you big hugs.
55941,"I don't have anything extra to add, but here's all of the internet hugs."
55942,I'm so sorry for your loss.
55943,"Oh, sweetheart."
55944,I am so very sorry.
55945,How horribly heartbreaking and unfair.
55946,You had so much to look forward to and it was all taken from you in a moment.
55947,"If you are in the US, reach out to your local nonprofit hospice to seek free grief counseling."
55948,"If you need help figuring out where to start, message me."
55949,I’m a hospice social worker.
55950,Do you have a primary care doctor?
55951,"If so, call them."
55952,Tell them what happened and see if they might  prescribe something to help you sleep.
55953,"Or, if you prefer non-medication interventions, put ease buds in and listen to guided meditations for sleep."
55954,There are literally thousands on YouTube.
55955,"Hang in there, love."
55956,"This is a hard, scary road, but you are NOT ALONE."
55957,You are loved and special and you will get through this.
55958,"Oh sweetheart, I'm so sorry."
55959,One bit of advice about grieving I'll give is: go easy on yourself.
55960,"There is no correct way to grieve, and no correct length of time to do it in."
55961,"Don't put pressure on yourself to ""get over it"" or feel bad because you're crying (again!)."
55962,Just do what you need to do.
55963,This is so unfair.
55964,I hate that this happened to you.
55965,"Oh honey, I can imagine the loss."
55966,My son died suddenly a year ago.
55967,Not just he is  now gone.
55968,"All of the promises the future held, shattered on the ground."
55969,hey sis.
55970,i'm so sorry to hear this.
55971,i would lose my marbles if this happened to me; you're being so strong!
55972,"i wish i had more to say, i wish i could help."
55973,i know you can handle this though.
55974,sending lots of good thoughts your way 💕
55975,"I’m so sorry, Alexa."
55976,Thank you for sharing you and Emma’s beautiful love story with us - and please keep doing so.
55977,Sending you so much love 💜
55978,"Honey, I am so sorry."
55979,My heart goes out to you  My husband of 36 years died 7 years ago and I miss him every day.
55980,We met in HS were friends for a year and dated for 6 before we married.
55981,We have 2 daughters and 3 grandchildren which are my saving grace.
55982,Be good to yourself and it might help to check out either a group on the internet or in person so you can see that whatever you're feeling is normal.
55983,"Greif is an ongoing feeling bc you love her and no matter what anyone says it will last, but it will get easier with time."
55984,"My husband was laid back, kind and funny."
55985,Not a day goes by that I don't think about him.
55986,"I hate saying I'm sorry or my condolences bc at first it sounds meaningless, but most people do mean it."
55987,"Most of all, take care of yourself and don't let anyone tell you how to greive."
55988,Sending virtual hugs 🤗
55989,I'm so sorry this is happening to you dear.
55990,"When my mother had a stroke, the hospital assigned someone to talk to our family to deal with the sudden trauma of this."
55991,You should have the option to call the hospital and see if they have a social worker who can meet with you until you get established with a long term therapist.
55992,This is someone specialized in helping folks who have experienced the sudden loss of or injury to a loved one.
55993,I'm wrapping you up in all of my love.
55994,Oh honey.
55995,The condolences are never enough but if you accept I am giving you a big hug and a shoulder to cry on.
55996,My pms are open if you need.
55997,Much love
55998,I am so sorry for your loss.
55999,Please seek help dealing with this.
56000,It is unimaginable pain and you need someone to help.
56001,Does she have family to reach out to?
56002,Or maybe your friends?
56003,Look for a grief counselor either way.
56004,Maybe plant a plant somewhere.
56005,Be patient and kind with yourself.
56006,She would want you to.
56007,Sending hugs (and kicks to the shin for your parents!)
56008,{{{{{🌹HUGS🌹}}}}}.
56009,Oh honey!
56010,Such a tragic story!
56011,"Emma will stay in your heart, and it’s OKAY to cry."
56012,"Find a support group like Good Grief or something like that, where you can talk about it to others."
56013,You’re going to need that.
56014,Create a support system.
56015,And don’t worry about blood.
56016,"That family is messed up, so make a new one."
56017,"I don’t know what the future is going to be like for you, but you’re allowed to keep Emma in your heart forever."
56018,My religious belief is in the eternal soul and we say “Memory Eternal!” at the end of a funeral.
56019,Our dead are never forgotten.
56020,She helped make you who you are today.
56021,"Honor her memory with love, keep photos around, and go on living, for her."
56022,I hope that helps.
56023,I am so so so sorry and yes I agree with the replies telling you to eat.
56024,Even if it’s just a little.
56025,Please drink water.
56026,💛 your feelings are so valid whatever you feel it doesn’t matter how crazy or weird they may feel.
56027,Your thoughts might be really anxious right now or you might feel more anxious now.
56028,And that is okay.
56029,I don’t know how you feel about journaling?
56030,Or maybe drawing or doodling your feelings out?
56031,Again I’m so sorry.
56032,I’m sending you love I’m sending you good energy.
56033,And would you like to make posts on this sub from time to time just to express yourself and we get to know how you’re doing?
56034,"Oh lovely, I am so sorry."
56035,I can’t imagine what you’re going through right now.
56036,Are there grief counselors available to you?
56037,Do you have friends you can lean on?
56038,I’m so sorry to hear this… my heart breaks for you.
56039,Please don’t isolate yourself too much and reach out to a therapist.
56040,I lost my boyfriend suddenly in 2015…we broke up right before he died.
56041,My one piece of advice is to find a support group….. going to the group caused me to have my first ever epiphany and it is the only reason I was able to begin the healing process.
56042,"Also, please, please practice a lot of self care."
56043,"This is a lot to process, especially considering how long you were together and the recent engagement."
56044,"If you have any questions about grieving, please reach out to me."
56045,I’ll keep you in my thoughts
56046,Oh sweetheart.
56047,Text a friend and ask them to help you find a therapist.
56048,"If you don’t have a friend you can contact, you can DM me your location and price range and I’ll look on your behalf."
56049,A grief support group would be excellent too.
56050,"I wonder if you could sleep on the couch, or with your head where your feet usually go, so it feels a little different."
56051,It’s normal to have trouble sleeping when something like this happens.
56052,"If you can afford it, I’d get a bunch of easy to eat food."
56053,"Frozen burritos, yogurt, stuff like that, so you don’t have to cook."
56054,"Be sure to keep yourself hydrated, too."
56055,And come back to us later.
56056,"Tomorrow, or next week."
56057,For now you just have to take it five minutes at a time.
56058,I’m so sorry.
56059,❤️
56060,Oh no....
56061,I'm so sorry for your loss.
56062,Please try to get into therapy ASAP.
56063,"I know that you're suffering a lot and since you don't have your family to lean on, it's especially hard."
56064,You have to go through the time it takes to heal.
56065,I am so very sorry.
56066,Hugs.
56067,I happy you had this love.
56068,Oh honey.
56069,I’m so so sorry.
56070,I hope you find peace someday.
56071,You’re going to hurt for a very very long time so please take care of yourself.
56072,"Find someone to talk to, especially a professional."
56073,Oh sweetie.
56074,My heart breaks for you and I wish I could help carry your pain.
56075,I wish I were there to hug you and rub your back and make sure you remember to eat and stay hydrated while you grieve.
56076,"Like everyone here is saying, find a therapist to talk to."
56077,There are ways to connect with one through apps/internet if you can’t drag yourself to an in-person appointment.
56078,"We’re all rooting for you, love."
56079,And so so sorry for your loss.
56080,I am so sorry.
56081,"Hugs, many hugs."
56082,"I am so, so very sorry!"
56083,Internet hugs!
56084,!
56085,"Can’t imagine, brutal."
56086,Grieving is normal then try and get out there and enjoy every day.
56087,It’s what she would have wanted and still wants for you.
56088,Good luck
56089,Thinking about you.
56090,💜
56091,I’m so very sorry for this loss…I wish I could give you a mom hug.
56092,❤️🙏🏻
56093,Damn dude I am so sorry to hear this.
56094,I have no words …
56095,Hugs.
56096,Im so sorry love
56097,Oh honey… I’m so sorry that you’re going through this!
56098,You don’t deserve this much heartbreak.
56099,"Here if you ever need a nonjudgmental ear, hugs to you sweetheart!"
56100,💜
56101,Take care dear one.
56102,I wish you strength and wish Emma peace.
56103,"This is a dad, I hope you don’t mind."
56104,Hugs.
56105,I’m so sorry.
56106,Baby girl I’m so sorry.
56107,I think what you have to do is find some grief support.
56108,You can call a mental health crisis line for example.
56109,Doesn’t mean you’re unwell just means you can get some assistance in resources from them.
56110,LSD/magic mushrooms could help with dealing with such traumatic experiences.
56111,"Personally, it has helped me overcome issues with mortality."
56112,"The trips aren't in any way ""easy"" or fool proof, but there's significant evidence (along with my personal testimony) that tripping is beneficial."
56113,"I recommend significant research, as trips can be very intense and it's good to be prepared Good luck."
56114,I wish I could hug you.
56115,I'm so sorry OP.
56116,Thinking of you long after I close the app tonight.
56117,♡
56118,"Oh, honey."
56119,It’s SO hard to lose the love of your life (I know from experience).
56120,These next few months are just going to be wave after wave of grief washing over you.
56121,People will try to help but sometimes they really don’t.
56122,Do what YOU need to do for yourself.
56123,"Take time to remember your love and grieve for her in YOUR way, not how anybody else tells you how."
56124,And always know that I am with you and I love you 💕
56125,"If you have a friend you can stay with or can stay with you, I highly recommend it."
56126,You shouldn't be alone right now.
56127,So so sorry.
56128,💓
56129,"Oh sweet baby, I am so sorry."
56130,I know this is so hard.
56131,I wish I could have known your love.
56132,I know you miss her so much.
56133,Is there anything you want to tell us about her?
56134,We would love to hear it.
56135,"Oh my love, I am so very sorry."
56136,The folks here suggesting therapy and some of the other support forums here are not wrong.
56137,"I'd also suggest that now, while other folk who knew your fiancée can still recognize that you are grieving, ask them for their stories -- of the two of you, or her before you were together, all of that."
56138,It will fking horrify you how quickly folks get uncomfortable talking about a death.
56139,"If you can bear it, do it now."
56140,"(Also, if you are either not comfortable with therapy or are a person who finds solace in reading, may I recommend a book?"
56141,A writer I used to know lost his wife very young and very suddenly -- pulmonary embolism.
56142,"His book about it is really insightful, not least about how weird and infuriating and surreal young widowhood can be."
56143,It's called Love Is A Mixtape [he is a music writer] and his name is Rob Sheffield.)
56144,My thoughts are with you.
56145,May her memory be for a blessing.
56146,We’re with you Alexa.
56147,❤️
56148,I’m so sorry you’re going through this sweetheart.
56149,Do you have any friends you can connect with?
56150,"If not, please seek out a support group either irl or social media (I’ve found some great ones here and on Facebook)."
56151,"Please do what you need to do to take care of you, and don’t let anyone let you feel like you need to pretend to be okay."
56152,"Take all the time you need, but I’ll say it again, please connect with someone."
56153,"Hugs to you, dear one."
56154,"Hey love, I've been carrying a lot of grief lately because of some recent losses of my own so I'm familiar with the feelings."
56155,It fucking sucks and it's not fucking fair.
56156,It's so not fucking fair that you got left behind.
56157,I'm so sorry you're dealing with this loss.
56158,"Like other people said, find a grief counselor, hopefully find some support in your life."
56159,Please don't try to bear this alone.
56160,There are online groups and subreddits here with people whove gone through similar losses.
56161,Finding those people helped me feel not so alone and allowed me to vent to people who understood.
56162,Give yourself a lot of grace and space to grieve.
56163,Stupid tip that did help me out when I had trouble sleeping: I just watched YouTube videos on my iPad in bed til I fell asleep just to occupy my brain with something other than what was going on.
56164,"Video game speed runs, compilations of old commercials, just background noise."
56165,I so wish you didn't have to go through this.
56166,"Omg, I don't know what to say."
56167,This is my biggest fear.
56168,"I'm so, so very sorry."
56169,"Please reach out to someone for support, anyone including friends, therapists, grieving/ online groups etc."
56170,Oh honey.
56171,I’m so sorry for your loss of Emma.
56172,"Right now it feels like you’re drowning, but your reaching out."
56173,"You found us, your internet moms."
56174,Keep reaching out.
56175,"Share her story with friends, find therapy, grieve the shared life that you lost."
56176,"I promise you, it will get better."
56177,You’ve endured so much allready and you’re so strong.
56178,The waves of grief will come and I want you to keep reaching out.
56179,"My DM’s are open for you, my love."
56180,"Oh my sweet dear, what a horrible thing to have to go through."
56181,"I can o ly i.aginr that Emma would want what is best for you and to honor her memory,  I would think that she would want you to take care of yourself."
56182,"It is a shitty road you have to ealk, but do ut with kindness in your heart for yourself."
56183,"Reach out and ask for help, you don't have to isolate."
56184,"I'm so sorry to hear this is your journey,  it's unfair."
56185,Oh sweetie.
56186,I am so so sorry.
56187,This is so heart wrenching.
56188,I wish I could give you the biggest hug.
56189,"It may not feel like it now, but you will be okay."
56190,But in this moment.
56191,Feel everything you need to feel.
56192,Grief is hard.
56193,But you are strong.
56194,I highly recommend therapy if it is accessible to you.
56195,Sending you so much strength and healing and love 💕.
56196,I am so terribly sorry to hear what you're going through.
56197,I can't imagine the pain you must be experiencing.
56198,I wish you so much healing.
56199,please fine a grief counselor or a support group.
56200,It will at the very least help you cope with knowing you're not alone ❤️
56201,I'm so very sorry for your loss.
56202,What a tragedy.
56203,"I would look into therapy to help you process it, you don't have to go through it all by yourself."
56204,"whatever you do, do not try to soldier through whatever it is you are feeling."
56205,you don't have to put on a happy face.
56206,"please know you work through grief, you have to go through the stages as has been mentioned."
56207,"there are people to help you cope, look for them."
56208,"LGTBQ center, check with your insurer, they may offer grief counseling."
56209,"community centers may offer it, even libraries have support groups."
56210,"as hard it is don't isolate yourself, be kind to yourself."
56211,"go for long walks if you like to walk, get out in nature."
56212,meditate!!
56213,put your feelings on paper.
56214,my sister and my daughter's father died within 3 months of one another.
56215,I put on a happy face and did the whole pull yourself up by the bootstraps routine only to crash and nearly burn a year later...feel into horrible debilitating depression..had no idea I had not coped with either of their deaths.
56216,you will never forgot your beloved.
56217,but you will learn to cope one day at a time.
56218,"please feel free to reach out, you are not alone 🤍"
56219,"Not sure what your beliefs about the afterlife, but it helped me to hear this: every day is one day closer, not one day farther away."
56220,"I wish I could take your pain away, stranger."
56221,It is your duty to live a life that would make your fiancé proud.
56222,Do it.
56223,One day you will look back and realize that there is even meaning and growth in the most senseless losses.
56224,Peace be with you.
56225,I am in tears.
56226,I am so sorry.
56227,RIP sweet emma.
56228,I pray things will get better for you.
56229,Sending lots of love.
56230,You are still loved.

56234,I'm so sorry love :( I cannot imagine how hard this must be for you right now.

56242,Hope you find some clarity.

56245,However  you will survive.
56246,My heart aches for you.
56247,"I can’t offer any advice or any wisdom as I have no experience with what you’re going through, but I have an Australian shepherd and 4 cats I can distract you with pictures if need be."
56248,I lost my fiancée (32M) suddenly in 2020.
56249,The best advice I can give is to feel your emotions and don't try to block them out.
56250,"There are going to be ups and downs as you recover, but don't lose hope if you feel like you are backtracking."
56251,"Even 2 years out, there are still things that catch me off guard and immediately bring tears to my eyes, despite me speaking easily about him most of the time."
56252,Prioritize taking care of yourself above everything else.
56253,It is ok to say no to people when you just don't have the energy.
56254,So many people struggle to keep up a facade when they really just need to be able to let it all go.
56255,"If taking things one day at a time seems too long, try one hour."
56256,"If that is to much, keep backing it down."
56257,Going minute by minute is still an accomplishment.
56258,Alexa.
56259,Grief is love with no place to go.
56260,Some days it's like an anchor on your heart.
56261,Cold and heavy.
56262,Some days it's an emptiness so hollow nothing is able to fill it.
56263,"Grief like love never ceases, we just adjust."
56264,Learn to breath around the ragged edges.
56265,Some days we find joy in the splinters of the pieces that remain of the Person we where when our love was here in this plain to be hugged and kissed.
56266,There is no right or wrong.
56267,You do grieve all of you as well as all of her.
56268,This is a hard thing.
56269,You are very strong for already you have lived through one of the hardest things there is.
56270,Writing it out.
56271,"Admitting to the World, that is what happened."
56272,That truly it did happen to you.
56273,"Take it slow, love."
56274,Let yourself be fed by others.
56275,Let yourself feel and go empty and feel again.
56276,Some day your love will be free again of the daggers it brings now.
56277,Richer and New in the depth you learned to span gracefully.
56278,"I love you, I hug you."
56279,I weep with you.
56280,I am so sorry for your loss.
56281,I wish you nothing but peace.
56282,"Many others have mentioned the five stages of grief, and I wanted to add [this](https://newroadscounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ball-in-a-Box-Analogy-on-Grieving.jpg) image."
56283,"It very closely resembles my relationship with grief, and it'll be four years this November since I lost my grandfather \[a different grief, but grief all the same\]."

56285,"Some days it will be hard - impossible, even."
56286,"You'll feel *horrible* about your good days, about laughing again, about enjoying life because it's awful that she isn't with you."
56287,"And that is perfectly okay - normal, even."
56288,"One day you will be able to laugh without grief or guilt, and that's okay too."
56289,Therapy or counseling is a wonderful tool that I cannot encourage enough!
56290,I lost my partner at 27.....what you need more than anything right now is grief therapy.
56291,Specifically trained and understanding people.
56292,Then you would benefit from having something to focus on.
56293,But time is also there.
56294,"It's cliché because its true, it takes time, sometimes a lot of time."
56295,"But I promise you, you will not feel like this forever."
56296,I'm so sorry you are going through this.
56297,"Hi honey, 
I'm SO, SO sorry that life decided that this had to happen."
56298,"Firstly, my inbox is open if you need."
56299,"Not just a mama, but a psych major, and grief mentor for the past 8 years."
56300,"There are lots of compassionate responses to your post, and I'm sure you have been given all manner of advice."
56301,Grief is one of those things that hits people differently.
56302,And it changes day to day.
56303,Right now you should be focussing on getting something decent to eat and a good hydrating drink.

56311,"And probably for the rest of yours too, even if in time that love becomes background like the way you love a favourite memory, experience or place."
56312,There are so many really great resources for grief and understanding it.
56313,I hope you're ok.
56314,My wife suffered a burst aneurysm at the beginning of COVID.

56337,Sorry if this comes across as insensitive.

56339,I’m so sorry to hear this.
56340,How tragic.
56341,I can’t even begin to understand how you are feeling but I know it must be overwhelming.
56342,Please see a therapist or join a grief group.
56343,Support is so important.
56344,But know that this group is thinking of you and sending mom hugs.

56350,"It sucks, and I wish I could tell you to just go get loaded, but that will only make it worse."
56351,"It'll never stop hurting, but it will hurt less over time."
56352,All I can add is it’s ok to feel your feelings.
56353,Take your time and do it on your time.
56354,Lost my dad two years ago  and it was a whole slew of emotions.
56355,Take your time and grieve how you need to.
56356,Try to find that closure tho.
56357,It’s so easy to stay in anger or sadness.
56358,It’s probably not the right time to say this but it will be down the road.
56359,Find ways of continuing with your life.
56360,It’s really shitty and Devastating to lose someone you love.
56361,They will not want you toiling in your own misery forever.
56362,"When you are done being upset, sad or angry everyday minute of the day, force yourself to get out and do what you use to love doing."
56363,"I hope this doesn’t come off as cold
And as someone telling you to move on."
56364,This is from personal experience.
56365,When you have given yourself reasonable time to mourn please do remember to take care of yourself too.
56366,Your partner wouldn’t want you to feel this way.
56367,It seems like they would only want the best for you.
56368,Take care of yourself first.
56369,"I wish you all
The best over the next few."
56370,I am so sorry for your loss.
56371,"This might sound weird, but you should talk to a therapist and consider getting a dog/cat."
56372,You need a companion and someone to love on.
56373,"Animals really do enrich our lives and although a dog won't replace Emma, it will give you an outlet for love that you might need."
56374,Sending you love and strength during this difficult time.
56375,Hang in there kiddo.
56376,I’m so sorry for your loss.
56377,Everything is going to hurt and suck for a whole while but you will get through this.
56378,I’m so sorry for the suffering you have to endure but you are strong and you will be ok.  Take comfort in the happy memories.
56379,"Try to remember the good times, you are resilient."
56380,"Be strong, be kind to yourself."
56381,Wrap up in a big blanket and cry as much as you need to.
56382,Journal if can find the energy.
56383,Activity might help boost some endorphins so if you can manage going for a walk/run it might make you feel a tiny bit better.
56384,This is gonna hurt but You will get through this.
56385,It’s going to suck.
56386,But Emma wouldn’t want your to give up on life.
56387,"Do her memory an honour and be kind to yourself, look after yourself."
56388,I’m so sorry sweet girl for your terrible loss.
56389,Internet hugs & a platonic kiss on the top of the head.
56390,Wishing you all the strength.
56391,I am so sorry for your loss.
56392,"Sending you a big, warm hug and also want to share with you these words of a wise Redditor from many years ago."
56393,"Again, I did not write this, but I feel it perfectly encapsulates the grief and sorrow of loss."
56394,Please take care of yourself and just hang in there through the waves for now.
56395,"Sending love, warm hugs, and support."
56396,"“Alright, here goes."
56397,I'm old.
56398,What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not.
56399,"I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks."
56400,"I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child."
56401,But here's my two cents.
56402,I wish I could say you get used to people dying.
56403,I never did.
56404,I don't want to.
56405,"It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances."
56406,"But I don't want it to ""not matter""."
56407,I don't want it to be something that just passes.
56408,My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person.
56409,"And if the scar is deep, so was the love."
56410,So be it.
56411,Scars are a testament to life.
56412,"Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love."
56413,And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was.
56414,Scars are a testament to life.
56415,Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.
56416,"As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves."
56417,"When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you."
56418,"Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more."
56419,And all you can do is float.
56420,You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while.
56421,Maybe it's some physical thing.
56422,Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph.
56423,Maybe it's a person who is also floating.
56424,"For a while, all you can do is float."
56425,Stay alive.
56426,"In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy."
56427,They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath.
56428,All you can do is hang on and float.
56429,"After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart."
56430,"When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out."
56431,"But in between, you can breathe, you can function."
56432,You never know what's going to trigger the grief.
56433,"It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee."
56434,It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing.
56435,"But in between waves, there is life."
56436,"Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall."
56437,Or 50 feet tall.
56438,"And while they still come, they come further apart."
56439,You can see them coming.
56440,"An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare."
56441,"You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself."
56442,"And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side."
56443,"Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out."
56444,Take it from an old guy.
56445,"The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to."
56446,But you learn that you'll survive them.
56447,And other waves will come.
56448,And you'll survive them too.
56449,"If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves."
56450,And lots of shipwrecks.”
56451,I am scrolling Reddit trying to distract myself from today being the 11 year anniversary of my son's death and I saw your post.
56452,I think my son knew you needed a momma hug from me.
56453,It is hard to lose someone you love so much.
56454,It sucks and I'm not going to sugarcoat the suck.
56455,People here are telling you to go to therapy but I'm going to say only do so if you feel ready.
56456,Immediate therapy might be right for some people and it might be right for you but you also may need time.
56457,Grief is one of those things in our society that makes other people uncomfortable so they want you to hurry up and move on to ease THEIR discomfort.
56458,Don't do that.
56459,Be sad.
56460,Be angry.
56461,Feel all the feelings that you need to as long as you need to feel them.
56462,"There is no right or wrong way to grieve, only your way so please do not allow anyone to pressure you into rushing anything."
56463,You may need to see your doctor to get something to help you sleep (I was put on Ativan and later Trazadone) and possibly an antidepressant.
56464,"Intense grief can cause your body to stop producing serotonin, dopamine and/or norepinephrine, which can all cause depression symptoms."
56465,For some people it may just be temporary but other people may need medication more long term.
56466,"Thankfully, I had a great primary care doctor that our whole family saw and she immediately called in sleep meds for me as soon as she heard what happened."
56467,(My son had a scheduled appointment in her office the day he passed.)
56468,"The main advice I can give you is absolutely, positively do not make any major decisions right now or for the next 3-6 months (at least!)"
56469,if there is any possible way to avoid it.
56470,"Don't give any of her things away now, don't move out of the place you shared (unless you cannot afford it alone) don't quit your job, etc."
56471,The emotions you are feeling right now will lead you to making rash decisions that you will likely regret later once you aren't so foggy headed.
56472,I had a difficult childhood and my parents both died when I was 18 (not that they were much support) so I understand not having much of a support system.
56473,"If there is ANYTHING and I mean anything that you need to talk about, need advice on how to handle or whatever, please do not hesitate to reach out."
56474,It doesn't matter what time it is.
56475,"(I am in the US in Texas, so Central time zone, CST.)"
56476,"Love, your internet Momma"
56477,I'm so sorry for your loss.
56478,"Please don't make any decisions for now, just take care of yourself as best you can, eat a little even if you're not hungry and sleep whenever you are able."
56479,"Grief is painful, because emotional pain affects the same part of the brain as physical pain, however feeling it is the only way to heal."
56480,"To begin with the waves of grief will crash over you and make it feel like you can't breathe, but you can and you will, and in time the waves will become further apart."
56481,"If you try to block it all you do is delay the inevitable, so it's important to find a way to process it safely."
56482,"That might mean a face-to-face support group, or a doctor, or a therapist, or an online forum, so take your time to figure out what helps and what doesn't."
56483,"Lots of the possibilities will be local and I don't know where you are, but you might find a starting point here [https://www.verywellmind.com/best-online-grief-support-groups-4842333](https://www.verywellmind.com/best-online-grief-support-groups-4842333)"
56484,Sending all of the love and light I can.
56485,"Love, 

sister u/_danceswithcats"
56486,You are so strong and I just KNOW you made your fiance extremely happy.
56487,"I’m so grateful to you for giving her that experience of being proposed to, the hopes and the dreams of spending her future with you."
56488,It is tragic that her journey in this world ended.
56489,You don’t have to be okay.
56490,"You can still love her, you can still honor her and live in a way that would make her proud."
56491,"I am so sorry you have to go through this, it will get easier with time but not on any one else’s timeline but your own."
56492,This mama is sending you so much love!!
56493,"You are going to get through this, I promise."
56494,I’m so so so sorry for your loss 💗
56495,"Idk if it will help *at all*, for the pain you’re in rn, but the moment I read that you literally *just* proposed, and she said yes, my immediate thought was “ohhh wow, she (and you!!)"
56496,"left on *such* a beautiful high note!” It’s like leaving the party while you’re having the most fun… she got to go *knowing* how very much you love her, and knowing that *you*, too, know how very much she loves *you*."
56497,"Small comfort I know, and it’s so totally ok if that same high note also makes the pain of her sudden absence even more intolerable, but I hope you know, and *can feel*!!"
56498,"!, her unconditional, profound love for you even now that her body isn’t here, because that love *doesn’t* die."
56499,"It can’t, and it’s yours until the day you die, and I’m just so f*cking sorry, OP."
56500,"It’s not fair and you both deserved a physical lifetime together, and I’m just hugging you so tight rn."
56501,"I’m with you in heart, message any time if the loneliness (esp at night) gets to feeling like too much, ok?"
56502,"Alexa there is a saying that is so overused, but overused precisely because of how true it."
56503,It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.
56504,You are so young.
56505,Too young to experience grief of this magnitude.
56506,But as you grow older you will continue to lose the people you love the most.
56507,And then you have to face the question the above saying answers.
56508,"If there is a good chance we will lose the people we love, why love at all??"
56509,Why go through the hell of losing the people that matter most?
56510,Why not just be alone so as to protect our heart from the pain?
56511,"To me, I would rather experience the gift that is true love, even if I don't get to keep that love for my entire life, than to go my entire life without experiencing love nor loss."
56512,I will take the loss to experience the love.
56513,"I am so sorry, you are too young to have to lose your great love."
56514,You deserved so many more decades together.
56515,"But I'm so happy for you that you at least have known what great love is, even if she was taken far too soon."
56516,I send you my love.
56517,"Oh sweetheart, I am so so sorry."
56518,I can't even imagine the pain of losing a partner.
56519,"You're probably feeling a lot of terrible things: grief, anger, pain, fear, guilt... and I just want you to know two things:

1."
56520,You're allowed to feel all these things.
56521,"You're allowed to cry, to scream."
56522,"You're going through one of the worst moments of your life, so don't let anyone dare tell you that you're overreacting."
56523,"These feelings are hard to work through on your own, so I highly recommend finding a therapist or grief counselor to help you."
56524,2.
56525,You did everything right.
56526,You made her happy.
56527,"You may feel some guilt, and that's normal, but know that there was nothing you could've done to prevent this."
56528,"Aneurysms are scary and can happen to anyone, and while it's easy to want to blame someone, unfortunately it's just one of those tragedies that just happens with no reason."
56529,"Again, I recommend finding a professional to help you work through these feelings."
56530,"I wish you luck, kid."
56531,"Take your time to heal, everyone has their own process when it comes to greif."
56532,And please take care of yourself.
56533,"Drink water, eat some bread, just the basics."
56534,I don't want you getting sick.
56535,- Dad
56536,"In the last few years I have lost my mother to cancer and wife to divorce, I would just encourage you by saying time helps."
56537,"My favorite analogy is the ball bouncing inside of a box, and on one wall of the box their is a button that is pain and grief and sorrow."
56538,When the ball hits the button we experience a wave of these emotions.
56539,"It’s strong and intense and it’s hard, but over time, that button starts to shrink, it’s still always there, we still get hit with waves of pain, but it’s less and less often, and also over time we learn ways to cope with the pain in better and more effective ways."
56540,I just encourage you to keep pushing on.
56541,"allow yourself to feel the loss, but just know slowly overtime, things will improve."
56542,I’m so sorry for your loss
56543,I’m so sorry for your loss.
56544,Try r/widowers for people who are going through something similar.
56545,"Your feelings are so valid, all of them."
56546,"Please start journaling, get therapy, sit with your emotions but also remember to make yourself do something happy too."
56547,I’m so so sorry.
56548,I’m so sorry about what happened.
56549,I’ve heard that some people might benefit from antidepressants or similar if the sorrow is too great.
56550,It can help you eat and sleep better so that you can handle the grieving.
56551,It might be worth getting some therapy with someone who specializes in these things.
56552,There’s also support groups.
56553,Hope you will be ok!
56554,"I know this sounds strange, but there is research that suggests playing Tetris soon after that kind of trauma can cut down PTSD symptoms in the future."
56555,I'm sorry for your loss and encourage you to connect to queer community in your city.
56556,that is a horrible horrible experience I am so sorry Alexa.
56557,fucking hell.
56558,it also must be horrible not having support either from family.
56559,I recommend therapy or counselling if that is at all available.
56560,bottling up is the worst thing to do and having someone just to talk to and someone who will listen may help.
56561,"and if these are hard, mental health hotlines are genuienly helpful."
56562,"they are there for you and in times of need, they have helped me a lot."
56563,I'm so sorry op... you're experiencing my worst nightmare...
56564,"Sorry for you loss, if you ever need someone to talk to:  
1-800-273-TALK (8255) or 988  


https://988lifeline.org  


The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline is a national network of local crisis centers that provides free and confidential emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the United States."
56565,"We're committed to improving crisis services and advancing suicide prevention by empowering individuals, advancing professional best practices, and building awareness."
56566,"Oh my gosh Alexa, I’m so sorry for your loss."
56567,"I’m heartbroken for you, and I wish I could give you a big hug!"
56568,"I’m also sorry that your parents are so closed-minded, you deserved so much more from them."
56569,"When they chose to have a child, they should have committed to loving that child regardless of their sexuality."
56570,"You did nothing wrong, you weren’t hurting anyone by being queer."
56571,"First, let’s do a self care check:

-	Have you eaten something nourishing and had enough water recently?"
56572,-	Have you taken your prescribed medications (if you have any)?
56573,-	Do you need to take a shower/bath?
56574,-	Have you gotten any physical activity (even if it’s just a 5 minute walk or good stretch)?
56575,-	When was the last time you were outside (even if it was just to sit in the sunshine for a couple minutes)?
56576,"I know it’s probably really hard to do the basics to take care of yourself right now, but letting those go too much will make you feel worse."
56577,Neglecting them can also impact your sleep.
56578,It might benefit you to look into grief support groups.
56579,"Depending on where you live, there may even be LGBTQ+ specific support groups, and on Facebook there are LGBTQ+ grief/loss support groups as well that you can join."
56580,"If you’re not sure where to find in-person groups, contact a LGBTQ+ resource center in your state/region and they may be able to point you in the right direction."
56581,"Individual therapy is also a good idea, if you have access to therapy."
56582,"If you can’t afford it, a lot of therapists offer sliding-scale fees that can decrease the cost depending on your income."
56583,"You can look for therapists that are LGBTQ+ accepting, there are many websites that maintain lists of safe therapists in a specific area."
56584,"Telehealth appointments with therapists further away are also an option, if you can’t find any in your area."
56585,"If you have friends or acquaintances you trust, please don’t be afraid to ask for help!"
56586,"People who care about you want to provide support, even if you aren’t super close."
56587,"Ask someone to meet for coffee, or to hang out at the park."
56588,"If someone you know has an affectionate dog or cat, ask to hang out with them and their pet so you can get some cuddles."
56589,"Honestly, finding *any* excuse to get out of the house is helpful when you’re grieving."
56590,"It’s very easy to end up self-isolating, where you end up just wallowing in pain and grief."
56591,Getting fresh air and seeing the sunshine (and other people) can honestly help a lot.
56592,"As for sleep, you can try putting a heating pad (like the microwave or electric ones) in her pillow, maybe wrapping it in clothes that still smell like her, and hugging it or putting it against your back so you can feel warmth there."
56593,"Playing some sort of ambient noise, relaxing music, an audio book, guided meditation, etc might also help."
56594,"Melatonin melts (I use the Natrol brand myself, they work amazingly well) can be very effective when taken 30-60 mins before you want to sleep."
56595,Get some movement and sunlight during the day and that will also help your body feel tired properly at night.
56596,"Most importantly, be kind to yourself."
56597,Show yourself the same grace that you would show a grieving friend.
56598,It’s okay if you need to just do the bare minimum at work or around the house while you navigate this situation.
56599,"If you are eligible for FMLA, you may be able to take leave for grief counseling/depression if you’re really having a hard time."
56600,Don’t feel guilty about using resources available to you.
56601,Please let me know if you ever need to talk!
56602,"Much strength to you 
I can't imagine the pain you must be through"
56603,"I know this post is 20 days old, but I only now read it and it brought tears to my eyes."
56604,"I’ve lost my person 8 months ago, it hurts like hell, and the last week or so have been particularly bad."
56605,"Your comment makes me feel like I’m allowed to feel whatever I’m feeling, and that feels good."
56606,I just wanted to let you know that.
56607,"And if OP is reading: I’m so, so sorry for your loss."
56608,My partner also passed away very suddenly - nothing has felt important or good since.
56609,I can’t recommend therapy enough.
56610,Carrying on the memory of someone can be a heavy load.
56611,It’s so much lighter when others help carry it with you.
56612,I’m definitely not a mom but this post and its comment section made me cry.
56613,Damn.
56614,"I hope OP finds all the support she needs, along with anyone else going through this."
56615,"I’m so sorry for your loss, but I am so thankful you found this relationship through your grief."
56616,"It’s really beautiful to think that together, you and his momma are keeping his memories alive."
56617,That you didn’t know her before his death makes this even more special somehow.
56618,🤍
56619,I wish I could upvote this a million times.
56620,r/widowers would also welcome her with open arms
56621,I would be careful saying no new relationships when a person is already feeling isolated.
56622,"They shouldn't jump into a sexual/romantic relationship right away, but expanding their friend circle is a 100% valid option."
56623,They need a support network and self isolating could make them feel worse.
56624,"hey, it's never to late to be moved by a post that helps you feel, if not better, at least more freely."
56625,I'm glad it helped!
56626,YES!
56627,And she would never think Im overreacting or that 'i should be over him by now'.
56628,"She will never get over her baby, it's so much easier to grief (its still hell) with someome who loved your lost one so much."
56629,And I kind of feel like keeping some kind of bond with him.
56630,Like a part of this relationship is cherrished through that friendship.
56631,It feels like he still is present in my life through her.
56632,Oh!
56633,You're totally right.
56634,I meant no new romantic relationships for a bit.
56635,Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify.
56636,I have seen people go both ways.
56637,One jumped really far into club life after losing his wife because he wanted an escape.
56638,That is equally dangerous as the ones who burrowed away in isolation.
56639,I hope OP can find some comfort with virtual supports even if we can't be there for her in person.
56640,Agreed.
56641,And OP... don't let anyone tell you how to grieve or how to nourish your soul.
56642,"Folks may try to push you, one way or the other."
56643,"Set your own path, duckling."
56644,MAGNA CUM LAUDE WITH A TRIPLE MAJOR!

56848,I already have my summer plans set but I'm still feeling a little lost.
56849,What kind of science and art were you into?
56850,Thank you so much!
56851,This comment actually means way more to me than you'll ever know.
56852,"I was terrified about not knowing which field of the three I wanted to pick as a career, but maybe I don't have to pick!"
56853,How I coped?
56854,Lots of crying honestly 😂 But I would set aside 2-3 hours of studying every night right before bed!!
56855,On Weekends I would force myself to wake up no later than 10:30 to get my studying done before any of my roommates woke up and began making the typical weekend noise!
56856,I'm a visual learner (Hence the fine arts major too) so making flash cards with color coded notes or making my OWN diagrams helped so much!!
56857,"I also always handwrite my notes, and when I'm studying for an exam I'll rewrite my notes and reword my definitions too!"
56858,magma cum load
56859,Cum
56860,Architecture.
56861,You don’t need in depth science but it definitely helps to have the bent towards science.
56862,"In art, you learn proportions and what makes things beautiful."
56863,I found it to be a well rounded education and career.
56864,There are other areas that can satisfy your strengths as well.
56865,"Product design, prosthetics, etc., areas that require someone with science and art abilities."
56866,Feel free to DM me or ask further questions here.
56867,P.s.
56868,I also got a degree in nursing after.
56869,"Not because I didn’t like architecture, but because of life events."
56870,"Magnum cum lord


Congrats OP, you deserve to celebrate."
56871,Do you have an Etsy shop?

56929,Super cool shop.
56930,Oh yes of course!
56931,In Ireland we celebrate it on the 4th Sunday of lent so it changes every year.
56932,The tradition apparently goes back hundreds of years.
56933,I think it's a fixed date in the US and was invented by someone back in the early 20th century
56934,Oh wow - those are beautiful.
56935,Gonna pick up one for myself
56936,The lamps are beautiful!
56937,Also the pokemon spacebar keycap blew me away!!
56938,Goregous
56939,Cheers!
56940,So much cool stuff on there!
56941,I remember seeing a video of a lamp like this being made.
56942,Wow.
56943,So much talent.
56944,"Not fixed in the US either, it's on the second Sunday in May."
56945,I had a surgery two years ago and mostly had to go it alone.
56946,Only had someone pick me up.
56947,"It was scary, but I did it."
56948,I had to have the same surgery just today and this time I had someone with me that is supportive and loves me.
56949,"I was so thankful to have him with me, but it also made me realize how brave I was last time, doing it all alone."
56950,I didn’t even tell my mom about the surgery last time and I’m no contact with her this time.
56951,Sometimes we can be our own parent and champion.
56952,You’re brave.
56953,You’re doing what you need to do to take care of yourself.
56954,"I know it can be scary sometimes, but you’re strong, obviously."
56955,I’m proud of you.
56956,I wish you a speedy recovery.
56957,Take this time to rest.
56958,You don’t need to do anything else.
56959,Sending hugs!
56960,!
56961,"Ducks, you're in the hospital, they have people to help with that feeling, talk to someone!"
56962,We love you and we hope you're taking care of yourself in your recovery.
56963,💙
56964,"Hello sonshine, 

I am deeply saddened, as a mother, that you’re navigating through this journey without the unconditional love and support of your mother."
56965,I’m sorry she hasn’t evolved  enough yet to set her ignorance aside and just love and be there for her baby who needs her the most.
56966,I’m the offspring of a self-centered malignant narcissist as well.
56967,"I, unfortunately, truly understand the pain and rejection you feel."
56968,"I am proud of you, love."
56969,It’s okay to be scared.
56970,"Repeat after me: *”It’s okay to not be okay.“*

Take deep breaths, sip some water, eat (follow the doctor’s dietary guidelines/restrictions though ❤️)."
56971,You’ve completed a big step in your journey.
56972,"That should be celebrated with funny videos (try not to laugh too hard and bust a stitch), cute animal pictures and videos and maybe a pudding cup (only if the doctor says it’s okay)."
56973,You’re loved here.
56974,I love you.
56975,Remember to breathe.
56976,"Come here, my beautiful boy."
56977,"Sit by my side and lean your head against my shoulder, if you want."
56978,I am so incredibly proud that you went the hard and difficult way to become the person you are today.
56979,"I am sorry that your bio mom is not here for you, but rest assured that this mom loves you very much and gives you all the hugs you might ever want."
56980,You are strong and beautiful.
56981,"Congratulations on your top surgery, love."
56982,"I'm sorry you're alone right now, and I want you to know I'm proud of you for taking such a huge step towards living your best and most authentic life."
56983,"💙🏳️‍⚧️
I hope you are not in too much physical pain after your surgery and wish you a speedy recovery."
56984,"I know how difficult it is when people you care about aren't ready to accept you as you really are, and you should know you're making the right choices for yourself and your long term happiness."
56985,"Oh buddy, I'm so proud of you!"
56986,And I'm so sorry that your bio mom couldn't be there for you for this huge step on your journey.
56987,"Please know, though, that you are not alone."
56988,"You are surrounded by an amazing community full of people who love you for who you are and are ready to become your family of choice, if not your family of birth."
56989,"You of all people understand that it is not our birth that defines us, but the choices we make, the people we love, and the truths that we live."
56990,"I love you so very much, and I hope you can feel the big virtual hug I'm sending you!"
56991,"Hey, bro."
56992,"I work as a mental health therapist, and most of my clients are trans."
56993,I’m so proud of you for having your top surgery!
56994,It takes tremendous courage to move toward your authentic self with limited support there with you.
56995,I’m wishing you a quick and easy recovery from surgery and many happy days of living your truest truth!
56996,"Love, a sibling"
56997,We love you son.
56998,"Right now, your priority is resting and recovering."
56999,Top surgery is good but serious business.
57000,"If you EVER need your gender affirmed, you come back and see us."
57001,older trans brother here: here's my wisdom.
57002,"the thing with being us is that no matter how we live, there's always going to be someone with their nose in our identity."
57003,there will always be someone who is bothered by us just existing.
57004,"so here's what i've learned: you're not existing for them, you're existing for you."
57005,and at times it's going to be difficult and you're going to wonder what you did wrong.
57006,"and you did nothing wrong at all; sometimes, it's just hard to exist."
57007,"and it's hard to learn, but you've got to realize you're not existing for them."
57008,you're existing for you.
57009,and some people won't be okay with that.
57010,and your mum may never be okay with it.
57011,"but i promise you this: there are plenty of people who are, and legions more who are proud of you for being you."
57012,"that, i think, is the hardest part of all of this."
57013,just being yourself.
57014,"but you're doing it, and i'm so proud of you."
57015,"love and identity has always been and will always be a war, unfortunately."
57016,"but if you stop fighting for the people who don't care and start fighting for you, i think you'll find you might just win."
57017,"you're doing amazing, and as your trans older brother, i am *so so proud of you."
57018,"* you've got this, big man."
57019,"the world is yours, and we're all so proud."
57020,x - your trans older brother dream
57021,"Oh my sweet nugget - you are so, so brave - doing this all by yourself."
57022,"Things will be OK - the pain will subside & the scars will fade, and you will feel more and more like who you were meant to be."
57023,I am sorry your bio mom is like that.
57024,"My mom is a narcissist, too."
57025,"Just know that regardless of what she thinks, you are special and loved by all the moms here in this group."
57026,"We are all very, very proud of you for living your truth."
57027,"Sending you light, love & hugs."
57028,Auntie stopping by.
57029,Surgery can mess with emotions; even if it is a surgery you have been wanting for some time.
57030,I feel like it’s a combination of emotions and medications given post surgery plus coming off anesthesia.
57031,Big hugs and know it’s okay to cry.
57032,"Dad for a minute here, you’re going to be okay champ."
57033,Just hold on and look at the world again on the far side of the pillow.
57034,Sometimes a day can make all the difference.
57035,Oh sweety!
57036,I am so proud of you!
57037,Your re so brave for going through this surgery!
57038,I'm so happy for you that this will help you to finally be your true self!
57039,I want to give you a big digital hug!
57040,You are an amazing human being and I am incredibly proud of you!
57041,"Oh sweetie, of course you feel emotional."
57042,"You’ve just taken this amazing big brave step and that makes a person emotionally raw, and also recovering from surgery can make a person emotional, all by itself."
57043,It is truly sad and hard that your mom isn’t by your side and we grieve that with you ❤️.
57044,"But also we are rooting so hard for you that this affirmation of yourself is a step towards finding your true new family — your found family, the people who WILL be there at your side."
57045,❤️❤️❤️
57046,Sorry love that your mother is not real with you.
57047,"It sucks but now is time for healing, weeks after surgery you will need to take care of the operation."
57048,"Stay safe and wish you swift recovery, lots of hugs"
57049,Hey my love.
57050,Just stopping by your hospital room virtually to see how you are.
57051,You are my priority.
57052,I’m so proud and excited for you - look at you getting top surgery!
57053,You must have waited so long for this day.
57054,How does it feel?!
57055,"I think you look different now, in a fantastic way."
57056,You are more YOU.
57057,"Still in hospital, huh?"
57058,Any idea when you’ll get discharged yet?
57059,Are you feeling ok or rough from surgery and meds?
57060,Im gonna stay and hold your hand a while and rub your back if you like.
57061,"Sending you love, my wonderful son."
57062,"Message me any time you need to, ok?"
57063,💜
57064,I’m proud of you for being brave enough to be who you truly are.
57065,"Love you, son."
57066,Sending you a healthy-mom very gentle hug!
57067,(So as not to hurt your incisions.)
57068,"I believe in you, Honey."
57069,May you find lasting happiness in your journey toward presenting as your authentic self.
57070,😍😍😍
57071,Darlin!
57072,I am so happy that you are one step closer to your dream!
57073,I am so happy that you are becoming on the outside how you've always felt on the inside.
57074,I expect to see your confidence and smiles grow and blossom.
57075,I expect for the true you to finally shine.
57076,You are not alone at all!
57077,Being your mom for a minute - I must say that you have more support than you know.
57078,"I am a cis gender mom of two boys, one who I think is bi."
57079,I will tell you this - there is nothing that could make me not love him.
57080,"There are several things I might not like about him (like if he ever kicked dogs or punched babies), but I will always love him."
57081,"He will always be my baby, and the only way I'd leave his side is if he didn't want me there."
57082,I also have a high school friend who went from a girl to a boy.
57083,She was the most insecure person I've met.
57084,She wanted to crawl inside of herself and was recluse.
57085,HE.
57086,"however, is the happiest outgoing person!"
57087,"He is a real joker, outgoing, dedicated father there is!"
57088,He got married a few years back and is living his best life!
57089,"His wife and kid are renovating their new home, and have a plethora of pets."
57090,(Which they love!)
57091,You are loved more than you know.
57092,I hope one day you get to see the love people have for you.
57093,Congratulations one becoming you!
57094,"My lovely one, please take care of yourself during recovery."
57095,You have found family here sending you love and hugs.
57096,Can’t wait to see you in the body you deserve!

57121,Do you want to tell us about what you're most excited about for having completed your top surgery??
57122,Is it the getting closer to your true body?
57123,The freedom from bras or binders?
57124,The laying on your stomach at night without the annoying breast-ramp?!
57125,"I like having tits but I'm gonna be honest, no breast ramp sounds AMAZING!"
57126,AND MINE ARENT EVEN LARGE!!
57127,"Hospitals are lonely feeling places at the best of times, and while your mom is failing you this IS one of the better times!"

57135,"You have a whole community of moms behind you,  who care and support you."
57136,💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
57137,"Sweets, you are a beautiful person and it breaks my heart that your bio mom isn't entertained enough by your fantastic self to notice."
57138,What a big step you've taken to make your outside look more like your inside.
57139,How are you feeling physically right now?
57140,It's a huge step to change a physical part of you that you've had for so long.
57141,That's going to take getting used to.
57142,Give yourself grace as you figure that out.
57143,"It's okay to mourn the change, while also celebrating the progress."
57144,And let me celebrate the changes you're making in your life!!
57145,You are my handsome cyber-son.
57146,"If you ever need encouragement, or a push, or an old woman cheering you on - I'm here for it!"
57147,Hey what you have done is super brave and its super hard to feel so alone in an unfamiliar and often times uncomfortable setting when your so vulnerable.
57148,To say im proud of you is an understatement you are being who you are and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
57149,Remember that if your in a hospital they have people around to talk to for mental health support and sometimes your nurses or support workers like to talk too if you just feel like a chat.
57150,If i could id give you a hug but all i can do is say you are my son and i love you so so much and im beaming with pride with how strong you are.
57151,If you need to talk to a trans mum who will support you and tell you how proud they are of you let me know and we can talk.
57152,Even if you don’t i need you to know wherever you are im rooting for you and j love you.
57153,"My sweet angel - if I were there, I would cover you in kisses and hold your hand until you felt better."
57154,"Don't worry, all the moms here love you very much and will pray for you during your surgery!"
57155,Be happy - your dreams are coming true!!
57156,XOXO - mom
57157,"Mom here 

I love your bravery in going forward with your surgery."
57158,I love you giant heart in how much you care.
57159,You do not need anyone else’s approval to heal.
57160,I am sending a giant bear hug with all my heart.
57161,"You are not alone, you are never alone when you’re so sure of who you are that you’re strong enough to walk into a hospital and endure what you have just gone through to achieve what you’ve done."
57162,That strength is a legacy of the people that came before you and all of the people that will hear your story.
57163,I admire your perseverance.
57164,Your “real” mother doesn’t deserve to be a part of your after.
57165,r/raisedbynarcissists helps me not feel so alone; I have a similar-sounding mother.
57166,"Sweet boy, I’m proud to be your internet Aussie mum, and I’m proud to call you my son."
57167,You are enough and you are LOVED.
57168,Congrats on the surgery sibling!!!!

57170,Please accept the biggest hug and a cuddle from a big sister.
57171,So proud ❤️
57172,I’m so proud of you for going through this ♥️ you’ll be out of there in no time!

57174,"Sending you lots of hugs, love and laughs!!"
57175,"And a forehead kiss 💕 with some head rubs 💕 you sound so sweet and loving, you’ll get that back one way or another 🥰"

57182,Oh sweetie I'm crying as I'm typing.
57183,You're so wonderful honey.
57184,Look at what your bravery allowed you to do.
57185,Be true to yourself and you did.
57186,So proud and my arms are wrapped tight around you my love
57187,I’m so sorry.
57188,Sending you love.
57189,Congratulations on this big step to becoming yourself even more!
57190,I hope you heal quickly and go on to live your best life!

57193,make sure u stay hydrated and get some of your fav food to celebrate if u can.
57194,this is such a big step toward living a happy and whole life and i am ecstatic for u ♥️
57195,"You’re not alone, dude."
57196,You’ve got a friend in me.
57197,"From one dude to another, cry if you need to, it’s like releasing the valve on a pressure cooker to let all that steam out."
57198,"Cry, let that pressure out, and remember that we get to choose our families, so surround yourself with people who love and support you."
57199,"Oh, and welcome to who you are."
57200,We all want our mum when we are feeling vulnerable.
57201,"It's sucks so hard to realise we don't have the mother we need and deserve, and it really is a deep grief when the reality of this hits us."
57202,"Sending love, and gentle hugs."
57203,You are doing amazing ❤️ bet you are looking amazing too!
57204,Sounds like some online shopping might help you feel better xo
57205,There is something about anesthesia that shakes out a lot of emotional stuff and it is really disorienting for a few days after.
57206,I'm sorry you're feeling the hurt so bad right now.
57207,"If you can, when you can, remind yourself you were just tripping the light fantastic and everything feels extra intense for a few days afterwards."
57208,"They are real feelings and they feel awful right now, and I promise, the intensity of the feelings will ease up in a few days as your body starts to recover from the shock and things."
57209,"""It sucks and it's gonna ease up soon."""
57210,It's a good grounding phrase to repeat over and over so you don't get totally sucked into that headspace.
57211,Take good care.
57212,Rest up!
57213,Hydrate!
57214,You will be feeling better soon :)
57215,Just remember that it is not your fault your mom doesn't know how to treat you in a loving way.
57216,"You're doing everything right-- being true to yourself, taking positive steps to be who you truly are, and building your own family of choice who can honor, love, and support you."
57217,You're incredibly strong and I'm proud of you.
57218,You are loved.
57219,I am proud of you son!❤️
57220,My son…I would take you in and love you until you are ready to be out in the world again.
57221,Listen my beautiful son.
57222,You are loved and you matter !
57223,Congratulations on the top surgery I hope you’re satisfied with how you look now.
57224,I’m sorry your real mom isn’t nice.
57225,If you need someone to talk to i may be a CiS white girl but I promise I’m here for you
57226,Sweet boy you have all of us willing to hug and help you
57227,"mom here, my sweet baby i’m so proud of you and going through this journey."
57228,you’re so brave and you’re handling it so well.
57229,"i’m proud of you being your true self, you deserve all the happiness and joy so keep pushing!!"
57230,"love you, hugs my baby."
57231,I wish I could come give you a hug round the shoulders due to your pain.
57232,But her is a virtual hug and a well done for been you and brave enough to get surgery
57233,HUGS OP !!!
57234,You are loved <3
57235,Hi sweet son.
57236,Where do we start?
57237,"You've overcome so much already, and you're well on your way to becoming your best and truest, happiest self."
57238,"That's all any mama would want for their baby, unfortunately not all of us can make peace enough within ourselves to accept that."
57239,"I know it's tough when ""real"" parents do not understand or accept you or your feelings, but for every parent who can't meet you where you are, there are many of us already there, waiting to take over and love you extra."
57240,"Beyond that, there is a whole world out there full of opportunities to meet and create meaningful bonds with other people who you choose."
57241,"Times like right now are hard to deal with, the feelings are heavy and overwhelming but you will start to feel better again."
57242,"Until then, we are here."
57243,"We hear you, we support and love you and we will keep you company."
57244,Feel free to DM me if you need to talk more.
57245,Just try to breathe and rest as much as you can.
57246,🖤
57247,Congrats on your surgery!
57248,All your internet moms are so happy you are on your journey to live your truth!
57249,Heal up and then spend a little time pulling together a support system.
57250,Sometimes our families are the ones we choose not the ones we are given.
57251,It’s no different then realizing you were born in the wrong body and fixing it.. you were possibly born into the wrong family and now you can fix that too ❤️❤️ all my love and hugs!
57252,!
57253,Hey sweetie!
57254,"You're on your way to being your true self, that's so awesome!"
57255,"Eat your veggies, be strong, and recover healthy."
57256,I'm so happy for you!
57257,"Much love and hugs, -Mom ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
57258,"Baby, if your real mom isn't there for you; there are a lot of people that will be willing to be mama to you."
57259,"If I were there, I would give you a big hug."
57260,I am proud of you for taking care of yourself first.
57261,Rest for now so that you heal well.
57262,"Do some journaling tonight, drink some hot tea and make sure that you eat a good dinner."
57263,Think about the good and positive people in your life that believe in you and make a plan to spend time with them after you are released from the hospital.
57264,"You need them, just like they need you."
57265,Hugs and thinking of you.
57266,Mom in Colorado
57267,"My love, my sweet sweet duckling… sometimes in life we have to shed big parts of ourselves the way a caterpillar does, to emerge on the other side the bright and beautiful butterflies we truly are… it can be scary, and painful, and so uncertain."
57268,"That is normal and you are so so brave to keep making choices that will help your happiness, even when your bio mom can’t support it."
57269,"The scariness and the uncertainty are necessary parts of truly transforming ourselves, too... it is not easy to live your truth and these trials that test our resolve are like a crash course advanced degree in self-realization."
57270,"Through the fire and in to your bright future, my sweet boy… don’t doubt for even a moment how worthy of happiness and love and support you are."
57271,"I am here for you… *we* are here for you, and always will be."
57272,"So as you shed the physical aspects of your self that do not serve you, let it be ok to also shed your bio mom’s ability to harm you."
57273,"You are safe, you are loved, you are perfectly imperfect, and you deserve so so SO much credit for getting yourself to where you are."
57274,"Onwards and upwards, duckie."
57275,"I love you always/all ways, 

Mom"
57276,Awww my dearest son.
57277,I’m so proud of you.
57278,You are braver than you’ll ever know
57279,"I’m so proud of you, beautiful boy, and I’m so sorry your mum isn’t a good or healthy person to have in your life."
57280,"She doesn’t know what she’s missing, frankly."
57281,"I know you feel rotten right now,  but brighter days are coming, and you’re going to get through this - look how far you’ve already come."
57282,"Hang in there, sweetheart, and before you even know it you’ll be over the worst."
57283,❤️
57284,You are loved.
57285,Xx
57286,I’m really proud of you for taking such a brave step all on your own.
57287,I know how scary it is to be in the hospital alone and feel unsupported.
57288,Take some deep breaths and know that you are loved and you can do this.
57289,"Take it one minute at a time and before you know it, it will be over."
57290,You are so strong.
57291,Sending all my love and wishes for your speedy recovery.
57292,Pain always makes emotions more intense; I’m not surprised it’s particularly hard to deal with your mom’s behavior right now.
57293,I hope you will soon be feeling happier and better than you’ve ever felt before!
57294,Congratulations on your top surgery!
57295,"It will hurt for a little bit, but it’s only temporary!"
57296,I wish I could be there and hold your hand though this all.
57297,You are brave.
57298,You are strong 🏳️‍⚧️
57299,Hey sweetheart!
57300,"As a trans woman who had FFS this year and was in the exact same position, feeling similarly alone, you are so incredible!"
57301,So often trans people have to be our own parents.
57302,"I think we deserve to be proud of ourselves not just as kids navigating our own shit without parental supports, but also as the compassionate parents we are for ourselves."
57303,"How we care and love and manifest better futures for ourselves, like any great parent."
57304,Find ways to celebrate yourself — the way you would if your own child had accomplished something so wonderful — in the weeks and months to come.
57305,I'm so so proud of you.
57306,"First off, congrats on your too surgery!!!!"
57307,"I know even for a procedure you wanted, it’s rough going through it alone."
57308,We’re all here for you.
57309,💕
57310,Sending you some love from far away.
57311,Sending lots of love and congratulations on your surgery.
57312,It is normal to be this emotional after surgery and I’m sorry there isn’t someone taking care of you.
57313,I recommend creating the opportunity for a spirit/ chosen  mom.
57314,I have one for times like this.
57315,My son just went through with his 3 weeks ago.
57316,Good on you for taking such a major step to be your authentic self.
57317,Her loss for not being supportive.
57318,Please focus on your new life.
57319,💞
57320,Well done!
57321,"You've lots of us here sending support, and hugs."
57322,I'd give you a real (gentle) hug if I could.
57323,"Lots of luck, take care x"
57324,Congratulations on top surgery!
57325,I am so excited for you.
57326,Remember that pain meds can make feelings feel even bigger.
57327,I’m sorry your mom isn’t there for you but we are all so proud of you for taking this step to live as your authentic self.
57328,"I’m a mum, if you were mine, I would be there for you, holding your hand right now beside you."
57329,"I’ve already got two kids who have come out in different ways, and it does not matter."
57330,"Let me be your mom also for a minute darling, I’m so proud of you!"
57331,"I know you’re sore, but this is only temporary, think of how you will feel when it starts to heal."
57332,"This is a new beginning, when you will start to feel like yourself finally!"
57333,This is the start of your new journey.
57334,"Wish I could be there for you, but sending hugs and love instead."
57335,💕💖💕
57336,Congratulations my darling!
57337,I’m sorry your mother is not supportive.
57338,"However, your mommas here are!"
57339,You are very loved and we are so proud of you for being yourself!
57340,It takes an amazing amount of bravery for you to literally have surgery to reaffirm your identity.
57341,You are a beautiful soul and should be proud of yourself.
57342,Hugs my handsome boy!
57343,Sweet love… (((HUGS))) my dear one.
57344,I’m so sorry you are feeling all alone.
57345,You’re not alone though.
57346,Not here.
57347,We’re all here for you.
57348,"We love you, and we are so, so proud of you!!"
57349,You are being true to yourself and that is an incredibly amazing thing and place to be.
57350,"Love, take a deep breath… steady… now… take another deep breath and exhale slowly."
57351,Warm cloth on your face.
57352,There now… look in your mirror.
57353,Do you see that beautiful soul?
57354,"That soul is so strong, and has so many Mamas behind him, supporting him, and loving him."
57355,((Hugs)) Please take care of yourself.
57356,This is amazing and I'm so happy you are finally on a journey to make your outsides match your insides.
57357,"This is huge and I'm happy for you, kiddo."
57358,"If it brings you joy, then it brings me joy."
57359,"That is the greatest thing a mother could hope for, that her child is able to find harmony between mind, body, and spirit."
57360,O.p.
57361,You just had surgery and it's a shock to the system.
57362,My buddy Viktor had this surgery and two years later you cannot believe how great he looks.
57363,He's in a much better head space.
57364,He too had a very unsupportive cult type family of origin.
57365,I'm so glad he went with his hearts desire.
57366,How he's made a family of his own.
57367,How his kids are so super supportive plus of course his friends.
57368,"He lives far away from me now bug I get to see him, the fam and the puppets on Facebook."
57369,You got this buddy.
57370,It's only going to get better.
57371,This was a big step!
57372,I'm proud of you
57373,We don't get to pick our parents but we do get to pick our family.
57374,The person I call Mom did not birth me.
57375,"If your ""mom"" does not accept you and support you for who you are, that's HER failure."
57376,When someone has a child they should know that that child is their own person and not create some vision in their head about who their child will be.
57377,Sounds like she missed that memo.
57378,Again...her failure.
57379,You just did such a tremendous act of courage in validating your identity and who you are.
57380,You are living your truth.
57381,I know how it hurts to feel unloved by who birthed you.
57382,It takes a lot of time to heal from that.
57383,"But I am proud of you, and so happy for this big step in your journey, and would be so honored if you were my child."
57384,"Keep your chin up, and don't let people bring you down."
57385,I feel sorry for her...she's really missing out on an amazing person.
57386,"Ohhh ducky, but you are not alone."
57387,There's this invisible thread between all of us that creates a glowing network almost like a mycelium.
57388,It connects all of us who have been hurt by those who were meant to be our guardians and protectors.
57389,So many of us have been where you are now.
57390,You are with them while feeling the rejection and the coldness.
57391,"And they, we all, have your back, hand  you more tissues, brew you a tea, place a blanket on your shoulder and nudge you gently to bed."
57392,"I wish the guardians would do their job always, but alas, we don't live in that world."
57393,So we find new guardians.
57394,I love that you are staying true to yourself.
57395,"You deserve all the love and the support on your path, ducky."
57396,"Oh, honey."
57397,"I'm sorry about your ""real"" mother."
57398,"I have a trans son, too, so I want you to know how much better you will feel after your top surgery."
57399,You're so brave (even if you don't feel like you are just now).
57400,You've got this.
57401,((((internet mom hugs))))
57402,Hey kiddo.
57403,I just want you to know that Im proud of you.
57404,"This was a big step, and I know a lot of waiting and hoping and planning went into making this happen."
57405,You’re gonna look amazing and feel amazing too once everything heals up.
57406,"Being in the hospital is really hard, as is not having anyone physically there to hold your hand."
57407,It’s okay to acknowledge that it’s hard!
57408,It sucks!
57409,"But you are so brave, and so tough."
57410,"I know you can do this, and even greater happiness is waiting for you."
57411,Do you have any plans for once you’re healed up?
57412,Cute new top to wear?
57413,"I recommend hawaiian shirts, because they are hideous and I love them, but ymmv."
57414,I’m so proud of you for taking this huge step toward being your genuine self!
57415,You’re so brave!
57416,I wish I could come visit and bring you your favorite meal and snuggle up next to you while we watch your favorite movie and I’d paint your nails and you could fill me in on everything that’s been going on in your wonderful life!
57417,"Then when you were feeling up to it, we could go out shopping for some new tops to wear for your new look."
57418,Hugs 🤍🤍
57419,"Oh my wonderful Duckie, I’m so happy for you to have gotten top surgery, but I’m so sorry that you have to deal with such hard emotions."
57420,You are on your way to becoming the truest you.
57421,"Just keep trying to take it one day  at a time, one minute at a time if you have to."
57422,❤️
57423,Hi Son!
57424,You’re brave.
57425,You’re stronger than you know.
57426,And I’m so proud of you for living as your most authentic self.
57427,Your light is shining so brightly and your community of moms is overjoyed to see it.
57428,Rest and heal.
57429,Sending you good vibes.
57430,My nibling will be going in for their top surgery soon.
57431,I'll tell you what I will tell them.
57432,"""How could I love you any differently?"
57433,"You are you, with or without breasts."""
57434,"They know I support them in this but I worry that like you, they will be feeling all alone in the hospital because their mom won't be there for them."
57435,I want their happiness over and above my own.
57436,I feel awful that my best friend is so blind.
57437,And all I can do just doesn't seem like enough.
57438,I have never met you but already I feel this same way about you.
57439,I think that you'll find that most of us here feel the same way.
57440,I know you feel alone.
57441,I know you feel scared.
57442,I wish I was wherever you are so I could say this to you directly.
57443,"""How could I love you any differently?"
57444,"You are you, with or without breasts."
57445,"I will love you regardless of your gender, regardless of your height, weight, hair color, etc."
57446,If you have blonde hair and dye it brown are you still you?
57447,Yes!
57448,"And I love you."""
57449,"Big hugs, you are going through a major change congratulations 🎊."
57450,It is usual to have the blues a few days post op.
57451,Talk to a nurse or health professional
57452,Hey kiddo..

Do you have a safe plance to go with a computer Google around and see are there any transexual person support groups online ."
57473,Honey.
57474,surgery is rough for everyone!
57475,it’s a physical toll on your body and now a rebirth!
57476,i’m so so happy for you!
57477,Don’t worry about how I feel!
57478,All that matters is how YOU feel when you look in the mirror.
57479,I look in the mirror and i see your aunt gertrude and LORD KNOWS she needs work.
57480,you’re perfect every day.
57481,"Honey, I'm so so sorry."
57482,There are people that are just not fit to be parents and that sucks because everyone needs and deserve a loving family.
57483,It breaks my heart that you're so completely alone and disconected.
57484,So much so that you're reaching out to total strangers in the abyss of the internet.
57485,"Please know that even when we're strangers, there are hearts that ache with and for you."
57486,"I¡m very proud of you for going forward with your transition, you're so so brave."
57487,You will get through this.
57488,"You'll look back and it will still hurt but it will be with a full heart and firmly planted in a happy life, with a chosen family that loves you

57499,"I am so sorry, Kiddo!"
57500,I think you are amazing.
57501,You’re body has been through a lot.
57502,Try to get some good sleep.
57503,I wish I could give you a gentle squish and let you cry on my shoulder.
57504,You are amazing!
57505,Fellow trans guy with unsupportive parents.
57506,Sending you love from one guy to another.
57507,"Honey, you are going through a moment, this is part of change."
57508,"Crying is allowed, it helps you get out the pain."

57513,You are not alone
57514,I'm a mom and I'm thinking of you and wishing you the best.
57515,You are worthy ❤️
57516,I had chest surgery and it took me a few weeks to feel normal.
57517,Your body is essentially healing from trauma.
57518,R/reduction is a great place for support and meeting others who may have similar struggles.
57519,You are STRONG and you are going to feel amazing when you come out on the other side of your recovery
57520,"Another mom of a trans son here: 

You are amazing and authentic and the  world is better with you in it."
57521,"Here is my favorite memory from my son’s top surgery: a few days later, when I got to hug him, his heart was so LOUD."
57522,All that nonsense that wasn’t him was GONE.
57523,The people who love you will be able to get right up close to your heart.
57524,It feels  amazing.
57525,Take it day by day honey.
57526,It’s worth it.
57527,YOU are worth it.
57528,"Please know that your chosen family is out here, waiting to be found— and they are going to love you so so hard."
57529,xo mom
57530,"Son, just know that this mom is proud of you doing the things you need to do to become truly yourself."
57531,You are definitely supported here and you are loved.
57532,Breathe and know that your first love has to be you.
57533,"Also, you have plenty of moms here."
57534,❤️🏳️‍⚧️
57535,"Oh honey, hugs ❤️"
57536,My son.
57537,You are so perfect to me.
57538,I love you just exactly as you are.
57539,You’re a treasure and I’m grateful that you share your wonderfully unfolding self.
57540,I’m so proud of you.
57541,"Sweetheart, i hope you can acknowledge your own bravery."
57542,You've faced this all on your own.
57543,That is such a brave thing to do.
57544,"Physically and emotionally, any surgery can bring out vulnerabilities."
57545,"One like this, with so much expectation and anticipation attached, it would be much more surprising if you weren't having strong feelings."
57546,Give yourself permission to feel how you feel.
57547,"Remember, boys get to cry too."
57548,I'm wishing you an uncomplicated recovery and joy with your new chest.
57549,Sending my love.
57550,Dificulties make the good times that much sweeter.
57551,You are not alone.
57552,You are loved.
57553,Your nurses are there to help.
57554,Please try talking to one of them when you can.
57555,You deserve love and it breaks my heart that you don't have it.
57556,You will.
57557,One day.
57558,Sooner than you expect.
57559,Keep on being who you are and striving to be a better you than you were yesterday.
57560,That is all anyone can really do to make the world a better place.
57561,Oh darling.
57562,"*Big internet hugs*

I'm so sorry your biomum isn't there for you."
57563,I'm so proud of you for having the courage to live your truth and to be who you are.
57564,The next few weeks are going to be really tough.
57565,You  need to rest and recover.
57566,Take your antibiotics and follow your doctor's instructions.
57567,You are worthy.
57568,You are important.
57569,You are loved.
57570,Now try and get some sleep.
57571,"You’re doing something amazing, embracing who you are!"
57572,One day you’ll look back on this and see it as a big step on your journey.
57573,Today we all see and we’re proud of you and supporting you.
57574,Ah honey!
57575,Firstly a big fat cyberhug all the way from Australia !🐨congratulations on taking that step to become your true self.
57576,"Most of the time it feels like a great relief, not to be in contact with someone as toxic as your mum, but when you’re feeling so bad, you just revert to that little child, hey?"
57577,"When you can, take a few slow, deep breaths , then remind yourself how hateful your mum would be if she was there."
57578,It really sucks that they don’t give you the support where you are.
57579,"It might be worthwhile to google trans support groups, or trans friendly therapists in you area( there is nothing wrong with you, but qualified, supportive help can be great, equally don’t go for anything religious based) sending you another hug,just for luck🫂"
57580,I am so excited for you to have gotten your surgery!
57581,That's a big freaking deal!
57582,I am sending so much love and good mojo for a strong recovery!
57583,♥️
57584,I’m already a mom of a trans guy…I’ll gladly be your mom too 😊 Rest up so you can heal!
57585,Be gentle and kind to yourself.
57586,"You’re beautiful, inside and out."
57587,You don’t see what I do.
57588,"Sending very gentle hugs, and love to you, sweetheart."
57589,Oh my gorgeous boy I’m so happy for you to have this affirming surgery.
57590,I’m wrapping you up in love and support from afar.
57591,"I’m just so beyond proud of you for standing up and being your true self, even when it’s been hard."
57592,You are wonderful and valuable and so so important.
57593,"Sweetheart, I am so sorry that you have no one there to support you."
57594,The surgery you had is no joke and please take care of yourself.
57595,Hugs.
57596,"Oh sweetie, there are many people who love and care about you."
57597,"If you need to talk now,  please ask the hospital,  they have wondeful people who can support you... some even have support animals!"
57598,Please reach out and make sure you get all the loving care you deserve.
57599,"Also,  best wishes that you top surgery recovery goes well and you get the outcome you wanted!"
57600,"Hey nephew, I think we may be in the same country."
57601,"I’m not the best in emotional stuff, because I disassociate (I’m more of a cool aunt."
57602,"But, for real, I’m saying this, because for your own good I know I’m not the best out there."
57603,"Yay, for neurodivergency /s), but in a pinch?"
57604,"I do have a ton of trans friends (and general LGBTQ+, being part of the community myself) that, in a dire situation, may be able to give you some pointers."
57605,"Again, in a pinch, because I know I’m not that reliable"
57606,Congratulations on your top surgery!
57607,Be kind to yourself and know that you aren’t alone ❤️
57608,"Sweet boy, I'm glad you can be who you really are."
57609,Congratulations on your surgery honeybee!
57610,I'm so SO PROUD of you for advocating for yourself and pursuing what you need-its not easy in the medical realm.
57611,But you did it.
57612,"Sometimes, our egg donors are not going to be mothers, and never will be, and that's ok. A mother is someone who loves you unconditionally, not necessarily only a genetic match."
57613,Take it easy honeybee.
57614,"Make sure you're getting rest, water, and that you don't strain your incisions too much."
57615,"If they give you pain medicine, get some stool softener since they can really back you up."
57616,"Also, pack yourself in with pillows at night so you don't roll over and hurt an incision."
57617,"We all love you very much, and we're so proud of the wonderful man you are!"
57618,"Aw sweetheart, I'm sorry you feel alone, but I'm so proud of you just for being you."
57619,I hope you heal quickly.
57620,Hugs ❤️
57621,"You are so deserving of love, happiness, tenderness and all the beauty of life."
57622,I am proud of you for being so brave in the face of so much adversity.
57623,"I know it doesn’t feel that way right now, but please know that you are never truly alone."
57624,"I’ve never met you, but I love you and I am there with you."
57625,"https://youtu.be/6OFv566mj7s

We love you, son."
57626,"The ladies up above said the words better than I can, so I'm just leaving a couple of songs for you darlin."
57627,"Wrap yourself up in this big internet Momma hug from all of us 💜

https://youtu.be/ODG2dCwnr00"
57628,Congratulations on having your top surgery complete.
57629,"Wishing you safe and restful healing, knowing that your legion of Moms (and Dads and Sibs) for a Minute are supporting and loving on you."
57630,"I am so proud of you, sweetheart."
57631,Look at what you are doing for you!
57632,"You are blossoming into who you truly are, and as a trans man that’s harder than the usual changes, but you are handling it."
57633,I believe in you.
57634,PS.
57635,"You are a son worth love, respect and kindness."
57636,You are!
57637,Firstly congratulations on being such a brave young man that you've stood in your truth and had the surgery you needed to find your true body.
57638,It's so brave to have done this alone and without parental support.
57639,"As a trans mom, I have to say; surgery was so scary."
57640,"I was in a different country all alone, just like you."
57641,"Though I found when I was there that this is close to what I would have wanted to hear, and I think it's important to say:

You're here, you're alive, you're more you than you've ever been before."
57642,"Whether or not your narcissist mom is there or not doesn't matter, you're stronger now than ever before."
57643,"Honestly even though no one else may say it, I'm super proud of you for doing something that's so painful and scary."
57644,You're so strong to go through something like this by yourself.
57645,"You've made it through the worst parts, and now you get to recover from it."
57646,You'll make it.
57647,You'll see your friends and people you care about soon and you'll be so much happier.
57648,Good job <3
57649,"Hi sibling, I’m so proud of you!"
57650,I’m so sorry you had to go through surgery alone.
57651,We’re there with you in spirit 💗
57652,I’m not a mom but if you need a sister I’m here for you.
57653,"The hospital has an amazing care team too, please talk to them."
57654,They are so good at comforting patients.
57655,I promise you are not alone.
57656,I pray you recover well from your surgery and that you come out feeling stronger than ever before.
57657,❤️
57658,I hear top surgery is amazingly painful.
57659,"You are going to feel better once that pain wears off, but it may take a while."
57660,"I had knee replacement surgery in the Spring, and my 'good' meds only went through 8 weeks post surgery."
57661,"It has also taken me about 4 months to start feeling more like my normal self - sleeping like my post surgery self, energy like my post surgery self."
57662,"And in my case, being more mobile like my post surgery self."
57663,"Given what surgery you had, and that you are on your transition road to becoming outwardly male to match your inner self, I'd think/assume that there are a TON of emotions whirling through you, and being barely 48 hours post surgery only makes it worse and make you feel horribly out of mental control."
57664,"I'm sorry your mother isn't supportive, that just sucks."
57665,I hope she comes around eventually.
57666,Hugs from someone else's mom.
57667,"Hey, big sis here."
57668,"I know I’m not mom, but just wanted to let you know that I’m so proud of you, and if I was in town, I’d be there at the hospital with you in a heartbeat even if it was just to watch some crappy TV together."
57669,"And know that I, and the rest of the sibs and moms here, care about you and love you so much, and we will always be here to support you."
57670,"Big, gentle, long-distance hugs."
57671,🫂
57672,"*in a rough-and-tough cowgirl voice*

Son, let me tell you an old saying that I heard a good while back- 

“The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb”

Now, you may have heard a similar saying, but that there’s the original."
57673,"Your mother may have given birth to you, but that don’t mean a damn thing if she don’t love you like a mother."
57674,"She chose to have you, and if she ain’t gonna love and accept the child she went through the trouble of creatin’, then that’s her own damn fault."
57675,"You ain’t doin’ nothin’ wrong, boy."
57676,What went wrong is your mother failed you.
57677,"It don’t matter none who the sonofabitch beatin’ you down is, you don’t owe them your love."
57678,"Your mama done chose her path, now you keep on goin’ down yours."
57679,You ain’t gonna get very far down a road if you keep tryin’ to turn around.
57680,"Take care of yourself, son, and remember, my door’s always open should you need to stop by for a spell."
57681,-Your unofficial new Mom
57682,You are very brave and amazing!
57683,I pray you heal very well and quickly.
57684,Take care and sending you lots of hugs 🥰
57685,I’m proud of you for taking that step and congratulations!
57686,You are stronger than you realize and you deserve to be happy.
57687,Sending you love from the U.S.
57688,I love you so much.
57689,I’m so proud of you.
57690,You will get life’s every happiness.
57691,"But for now, just rest."
57692,Giving you all my love xoxo
57693,Bro you’re so brave for facing this down by yourself!!
57694,"Congratulations, I hope you have a very speedy recovery."
57695,"❤️ Your family should be proud of such a strong, determined son."
57696,I wish you the best!
57697,!
57698,"Brother, you're going to make it through!"
57699,And be even better after.
57700,I have a friend who's had bottom surgery and is awaiting top surgery.
57701,And is apprehensive and also excited.
57702,YOU DID IT.
57703,Celebrate becoming who YOU are.
57704,<3  I love you.
57705,We all love you.
57706,"Hi brother

More support resources: r/reduction is not trans specific (and I understand top surgery isn’t reduction, exactly), but there is space for you, your emotional wellbeing, and your recovery from surgery - its not just women on that subreddit."
57707,"They supported me so much when I had a reduction, and I have seen a lot of trans and nonbinary people receiving support"
57708,[removed]
57709,I’m sorry you’re alone right now.
57710,"As a nurse and a mom, are you in physical pain?"
57711,Don’t let that get out of hand.
57712,You are special and I’m proud that you’ve been able to take these steps to make yourself happy.
57713,"That’s all that I wish for any of my kids, just be who you are meant to be"
57714,Non a mom but just wanted to say congrats on getting top surgery!!
57715,It's a huge step!
57716,I know what it's like not to have parents around.
57717,"I know what it's like to wish you had them, despite their past behavior, yet knowing that you're better off without them."
57718,You're not alone brother.
57719,Hi kiddo.
57720,"I might not be that much older than you, but my fiancé is a trans man with a narcissistic and abusive mother too, so your post really hit me hard."
57721,Congratulations on the top surgery!
57722,It is so incredible you're taking this step on your journey.
57723,"I know it must be tough and scary doing this without a loving mom there, but know we're all here supporting you!"
57724,"If i could give you a hug, I would."
57725,A very gentle one so to not bother those healing scars!
57726,I'm so proud of you for surviving and choosing yourself and your health to get here.
57727,I can tell that you are so so brave.
57728,"Although I wish the world didn't ask you to be so brave, I am so proud of your strength and know that you will be okay ❤️ I know that you will find happiness with your new body and love and support in a family of good people that you choose in this next phase of your life."
57729,You matter.
57730,You are worthy of love.
57731,"We're here for you, always."
57732,"Hey bro, trans sis here 💙 I'm so sorry you're alone, but you've all these people here that care for you."
57733,"You're loved and cherished, I promise 💙💙

And if you ever need to, my inbox is open!"
57734,♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
57735,Sweet baby..
57736,"I'm so sorry that you aren't getting all the acceptance, love, and support you need right now from the people who should give that."
57737,My youngest is trans(masc) also.
57738,Thinking of you alone and just needing your mom to love you right now breaks my heart.
57739,You're not MINE but i still claim you today regardless.
57740,"From a sis, sending you so much love, and hey congrats for getting a step closer to your dream!"
57741,"You have come so far, you are so strong!"
57742,I am sooo proud of you.
57743,I wish you a healthy recovery and peaceful life ❤️❤️❤️
57744,Today was an emotional day but look what you've gained.
57745,You traded your body in for one better suited for you.
57746,You also gained 1475 (and counting) loving and supportive new moms.
57747,You've got this.
57748,Gentle hugs
57749,"Mijo, you’re my boy and I’m very proud of you."
57750,I know it was scary and I know it hurt but you faced your fear.
57751,You manned up!
57752,You’ve done a very brave thing.
57753,You looked out for yourself and loved yourself in a way that most people would be too scared to do.
57754,You’ve  honored yourself!
57755,Wow!
57756,I’m so relieved you came out all right in spite of all the mistakes I’ve made along the way.
57757,I’m so excited!
57758,"Pain makes you cry, because it’s exhausting."
57759,You’ll find yourself to be more emotional from that alone.
57760,But you are now the you you always dreamed of.
57761,Eyes on the prize!
57762,You’ll get through this.
57763,"Don’t be afraid to ask for Tylenol & ibuprofen at the same time, toradol, or something stronger if you need it."
57764,After more than one of my surgeries I was so miserable I could only say “oh god what did I do!” Day 2-3 are some of the hardest but you will heal.
57765,You’ve got this!
57766,"I wish I could connect you with my nephew, who also had top surgery as part of his transition."
57767,I wish I could give you a huge hug.
57768,Hey dude!
57769,Major congratulations on your surgery - thoughts are with you that there’s no complications and you heal handsomely!
57770,"Make sure you follow ALL care instructions - not raising your arms or lifting things, limiting motion, etc."
57771,and then do ALL your physical therapy.
57772,"It will suck, but it will suck more later if you don’t do it."
57773,I’m so proud of you.
57774,I look up to you and your bravery.
57775,💙
57776,I don't plan on having any children.
57777,I'm just a role playing mom here.
57778,"But I'm planning that when I get older, I'll get in an LGBTQ+ association and role playing for real to be a loving mom for those who may need it."
57779,"That being said, we're all here rooting for you."
57780,I hope these awful feelings fade away so you can see yourself shine ✨
57781,"Hey bro, first off congrats to getting the surgery from a trans sibling, have a big hug from afar - I know this is scary and depressing and all that, but I believe in you and your ability to get through this shit and come out on top afterwards."
57782,Please take it easy and have a good and speedy recovery <3
57783,Nb sib here.
57784,I am sorry that I live so far from you now und cannot visit you in the hospital.
57785,I wish I could!
57786,It is so good to hear from you though.
57787,I was so worried during your surgery.
57788,"But now that I know you are fine, I am so, soooo happy for you!"
57789,You made it!
57790,You talked about it for a long time and you really made it happen!
57791,I am so glad that you will finally get to feel more comfortable in you body.
57792,"I cannot wait to go to the beach with you next summer but I can wait even less to see you just be happy, relaxed and comfy from now on."
57793,No more binders!
57794,"Also, since you do not need them anymore, can I have them?"
57795,;) thank you for being my awesome brother.
57796,Talk to you soon!
57797,You know you can always hit me up.
57798,xxx
57799,"My sweet, brave, handsome son."
57800,I'm so proud of you.
57801,"You have every right to be who you are, take up space in this world, live your authentic truth, and demand the medical care you require for your well-being."
57802,"A big part of doing the brave thing is that low point of not feeling brave, of feeling alone and scared and desperate."
57803,It's human.
57804,"You're there now, and you'll be there again."
57805,But you did the bravest thing of all - you asked for help.
57806,You decided to bend before you break.
57807,I'm proud of you.
57808,"It's hard when you didn't get that love from your mom, and it puts your heart in survival mode."
57809,"But all around, there are people who want to know you, want to help you, want to love you."
57810,"The greatest joy in life is learning to love and be loved in return, and it's my greatest hope for you."
57811,"Be well, Son."
57812,Congrats darling.
57813,I'm so happy for you.
57814,"We are here for you, alright?"
57815,"Don't worry, we will celebrate for you."
57816,You are an amazing soul and so loved
57817,Hey kiddo!
57818,"I'm a non-binary parental figure and I just started T a week ago, so I'm super proud of how far you've come and I know the courage it takes to take those steps!"
57819,"Your mum doesn't know what she's missing out on, so let her miss out and find the people in your life who will celebrate this monumental achievement."
57820,"I know it will still hurt, nothing will ever stop that, but you can balance it out with positivity."
57821,"Keep up the good fight, I can't wait to see the wonderful things you go on to do!"
57822,We care about you <3
57823,Aww sweet child.
57824,I’m sorry you’re going through this alone.
57825,I’m so proud of you.
57826,You are very brave.
57827,One thing I’ve learned is that  not everyone should be a parent.
57828,Some people are just too selfish.
57829,It’s never a reflection of the child.
57830,"It’s not you, it’s her."
57831,"You are perfect just the way you are, and if she doesn’t see that, it’s her loss."
57832,"I believe in you, and so do a whole bunch of other moms here."
57833,You got this!
57834,Sending you all the hugs you need.
57835,Hey babes.
57836,I love you.
57837,🌷 You're not alone in spirit.
57838,You're going to be ok and I hope you have a safe recovery.
57839,❤️
57840,Random nurse checking in.
57841,"Your nurses probably don't have the time, and even if they have it's not something we're supposed to say because it's not professional... but there's nothing more heartbreaking than a patient without support."
57842,"Sibling here, hard is an understatement for the feelings you’re feeling right now."
57843,Everyone else here has already provided a lot of support.
57844,So I’m going to provide some validation for the feelings you’re feeling right now.
57845,It’s okay to be crying about this.
57846,You’re grieving in away.
57847,The way your “mother” is not acknowledging the wonderful man you are.
57848,The man you’ve become.
57849,"I’m really proud of you for taking that step, it’s a big one and I hope you feel more comfortable in your body

I love you bro."
57850,Hey there.
57851,"I’m not a mom, but I am a non binary individual (they/them) and that’s struggled with some gender dysphoria in the past, and still with some discrimination now."
57852,I also have friends who are getting too surgery soon.
57853,"Just wanted to say you sound like an awesome guy, and I’m so happy that you’ve gotten your surgery."
57854,Those under the Trans umbrella are so strong and amazing.
57855,We’re rooting for you.
57856,Congratulations!
57857,"It's very brave to face surgery on your own, but you have done it."
57858,Now you get the rewards!
57859,Sending you a big bear hug!
57860,"Darling boy, I am so proud of you for finding yourself and taking this journey, which I am sure can be hard as well as wonderful."
57861,I am sending love and great big (but gentle post-surgery) hugs to you.
57862,Please please please make sure you have a good and loving therapist and support group to help you receive the support your birth mom is incapable of giving.
57863,And come back here ANY time you need to!!!
57864,!
57865,Hi love.
57866,I know it feels lonely.
57867,I am proud of you.
57868,It isn’t easy to be who you were meant to be.
57869,But courage and bravery are within you.
57870,Live your life and live it well
57871,I wish I could go visit you.
57872,I knit as a hobby and I make blankets and scarves and sometimes sweaters and I give them to whoever wants/needs them.
57873,"I’d totally bring you a nice warm scarf or blanket, a cup of tea and great thick book to read during recovery."
57874,Or sit with you and just hold your hand.
57875,"❤️

Be well."
57876,You are important.
57877,You are loved.
57878,"You know, some people's best efforts are a D-/D, and that's it."
57879,"They ain't ever going to get to be A+, and the best you can hope for is a C-."
57880,My mother was one of those people.
57881,"I made peace with it, and let it go."
57882,"Maybe mom will come around, maybe she won't."
57883,How exciting you have a whole new chapter in your life to explore!
57884,"Focus on your new life, and sort of put mom on the back burner."
57885,You can only control you.
57886,<3
57887,"Son, I promise that there is love in the world for you and it will find its way to you."
57888,"(You are welcome to reply to me, but it’s not necessary."
57889,Love is free.)
57890,💙
57891,"My love,my darling daughter."
57892,I see you strong brave one.
57893,I am here by your side.
57894,I am so proud of you taking this step.
57895,"It’s is ok to cry, we all need a good cry every now and then."
57896,But you are not alone.
57897,Much love little one.
57898,"Bro, is there \*anyone\* you can call?"
57899,I don't want you to go home and then not be able to take care of yourself.
57900,If you're in Orlando reply yes and I will find you.
57901,No one should have to be alone at such a time.
57902,* Hugs*
57903,"Honey, we’re here for you."
57904,So glad the surgery is over.
57905,I hope you’re not in any pain.
57906,Let the hospital staff know you need someone to talk to.
57907,Maybe one of the hospital clergy could sit with you.
57908,I wish I could hug you.
57909,You’re on your way to being the You you know is right.
57910,That’s a great step.
57911,Keep going and know we love you.
57912,A dear friend had her top surgery recently and it’s been amazing for her.
57913,You’re not alone!
57914,You are loved and perfect the way that you are and you have all of the family that you need.
57915,Chosen family is the best!
57916,Do you have friends/support to help you with recovery?
57917,"Honey baby, I will always love and support you for who you are."
57918,"You’re still my baby, no matter who you are."
57919,You’re going to be just fine.
57920,"Take care of your wounds, listen to your doctors and ask questions my sweet."
57921,"I’m so proud of your courage to become who you are, and you always have my support."
57922,💙💙
57923,I love you!
57924,You’ll be ok and you’ll feel so good once you heal and can feel comfortable in your body.
57925,Make sure you baby your wounds and apply lots of vitamin e and use scar cream or hydrocolloidal bandages.
57926,Watch some parks and rec and try to get some rest.
57927,"Love, mom ❤️"
57928,Hey I know that I'm just a random stranger on the internet but I'm sending you virtual hugs right now
57929,"Hey sweetie, I'm not going to pretend to understand what you're going through, with regard to transitioning."

57936,"Listening to who you are, and what you want from life."
57937,"You keep being you, unapologetically and I wish you all the happiness and for the days you feel alone remember, your never alone when here, we're all your mum ❤️."
57938,Oh babe nonono she just does not understand how great you are.
57939,What a loss for her.
57940,Biggest hug to you!!!
57941,!
57942,"My child had their top surgery two years ago, and if your experience is anything like theirs, what lies on the other side of this is FANTASTIC."
57943,They are so much happier.
57944,And you are not alone.
57945,All the moms here are with you in spirit.
57946,"And this internet mom sends you a gentle hug, my son."
57947,Big sis here.
57948,I'm so proud of you for taking steps to be comfortable in your own skin.
57949,So incredibly proud.
57950,All I ever wanted was to see you happy.
57951,"I know that person who birthed you is being cold hearted, and maybe she has her own reasons for it."
57952,That doesn't me she should take it out negatively on you.
57953,"Family is related by love, not blood."
57954,You don't owe her anything...but I do know how great a mom hug would feel.
57955,"I wish I could give you a big sister hug, maybe a nuggie just to remind you that I'm the big sis here and that you always be my favorite younger sibling, no matter what."
57956,"Course I'll still call you twerp and dweeb, because you are still you...just your outside is starting to match the inside."
57957,"One step at a time, one problem at a time."
57958,You are rocking it and I love you so much.

57981,Sending lots of love!
57982,- Your enby sibling <3
57983,Hey sib.
57984,My other mom is also a terrible human who also didn't love me as I was and I didn't even have to be so brave and strong to alter my body to match who I knew I was inside.
57985,I can only imagine the pain  💔  truly it must be so overwhelming.
57986,But im sure that its magnified too by physical pain and the trauma that anesthesia puts our brains through.
57987,"It makes allllllll mental health woes sooooo much worse for a few days sib, I've been there with injuries so many times."
57988,You really ride an emotional wave just getting your body to connect with the world.
57989,I know this might be the hardest time for you yet.
57990,But you survived and were so brave to get here.
57991,You can do it and we all believe in you.
57992,From Sister to Brother.
57993,I am so proud of you for being who you truly are 💙.
57994,It is so hard sometimes when Mom doesn’t care to understand us.
57995,Any problems Mom has are HERS.
57996,She can live with them.
57997,Don’t carry them with you.
57998,"You are loved by so many, and we are all pulling for you."
57999,I hope you have a quick recovery and enjoy every moment of growing into who you are meant to be!
58000,Love you!
58001,Big Sis.
58002,"Hey, little bro."
58003,I’m sorry your mom doesn’t care.
58004,But we do.
58005,You are  who you were meant to be.
58006,"Rest up, try to relax."
58007,I’m so proud of you.
58008,🏳️‍⚧️
58009,Hey bro!
58010,Congrats on your top surgery!
58011,"Nothing feels better than being who you are, and you deserve people who love and care for you."
58012,"You’re a message away from all of us here, and as one trans guy to another, you’ve got this!"
58013,I’m rooting for you!
58014,❤️
58015,"Hey little brother, I hope you won't mind a sister sending hugs your way."
58016,I am so proud of you for living your truth.
58017,Hi sibling!!
58018,I wish I wasn’t away from you right now so I could sit next to you on that floor and hug you (if you wanted).
58019,I know what it feels like to be rejected for being who you are by a parent.
58020,It is devastating.
58021,It is soul crushing.
58022,It is unexplainably painful.
58023,I’m so proud of you for staying true to who you are and moving forward making choices to solidify that.
58024,One of the best things to come from feeling alone like that is having the freedom to choose your family.
58025,"You will find your tribe, and I hope I’m part of it ♥️"
58026,"Not a mom, but I want to chime in as a sibling."
58027,"You're my latest greatest little brother, and I hope you heal well and awesome."
58028,You're strong as heck.
58029,<3
58030,Hey bro.
58031,"I'm so proud of you, dude!"
58032,You've been though a lot.
58033,I wish I could give you a (gentle) hug and tell you how great I think you are!

58042,Second... what are you doing on Reddit instead of resting?!
58043,Please take care!!
58044,💙
58045,"In my country they don't really have psychological help ready like that, we don't even have a suicide hotline (something that would have been very useful to me in the past), but thank you, truly."
58046,"Even just a thought from out there, it means a lot to me 💙"
58047,"""sonshine"" I'm stealing this 🥺."
58048,Sonshine... 🥺😭😭 making me tear up before work mom!
58049,im tearing up at this.
58050,you have such an eloquent way with words.
58051,so much power and love.
58052,proud of you mom.
58053,"And here I go, crying again."
58054,"Thank you for your kindness, truly."
58055,"Thank you for your kind words 💙 The physical pain is manageable, and I'm just a bit unsteady right now, but I'll be again myself soon enough, I promise."
58056,I can totally feel it.
58057,Thank you.
58058,💙
58059,I'm not OP.
58060,But I'm proud of you.
58061,Thank you 🥺💙 I'm sorry your mother is the same—I hate the fact that other people experience this same feeling of void.
58062,"I hope you found a family that loves you for who you are—if not, here I am!"
58063,!
58064,"💗

Not OP but thanks Dad, I really needed to hear that right now."
58065,"Good night, sleep tight."
58066,"...thank you so so much, I gladly accept the hug 💙"
58067,"Thank you, I know I shouldn't even think about it."
58068,"I'm used to be by myself, I'm probably just overly emotional right now."
58069,Thanks for the hugs 💙
58070,I've been discharged today!
58071,"It has been really wild to get back to the place I'm staying for now, but tonight I'll sleep with a real pajama at least :-)

Thank you so much for caring <3"

58082,"I'm sorry for your experience, but I'm glad you're better now!"
58083,"Thank you so much 💙 I'm out of the hospital now, but this was a funny thing—they had no TVs at all!"
58084,First time I've seen a hospital with no TVs in the rooms!
58085,Thank you so very much 💙💙
58086,Thank you 💙
58087,Thank you!
58088,!
58089,Ehhh that's not really in the spirit of our rules about avoiding/minimizing unnecessary negativity.
58090,"We can do without the last paragraph, although I agree with the sentiment, it's not appropriate here."
58091,"I'd be a son, but thank you!"
58092,You're very very sweet 💙
58093,"I'm not home, I'm at my fiancé's place (whose parents are homo-transphobic and have no idea we are a couple, so you can very well imagine, lol.)"
58094,"However, he's doing his best to assist me during my stay, so I guess I'm already very lucky as I am."
58095,Thank you <3
58096,"I'm in a sad little town in a sad little European country, but thank you, I'm totally there in spirit   💙💙"
58097,I've been discharged today after four days in.
58098,"The pain is a good 7.5/10 but I can endure it, I just have to wait for the days to pass."
58099,Thank you <3
58100,"Thank you, and I'm so happy for your child!"
58101,:)
58102,Lol well I’m on Reddit in bed.
58103,So I am resting.
58104,Doggo is lying next to me 🥺
58105,No one expects the butterfly to do barrel rolls immediately after leaving the cocoon.
58106,You’re becoming your best self.
58107,It doesn’t have to be pretty to be necessary.
58108,We love you here and are privileged to see more of that you than most.
58109,Keep showing it to more people.
58110,You’re doing great.
58111,"Sweet darling, we’re are legion of moms out here thinking of you."
58112,"Don’t be afraid to reach out for a pep talk, advice on what to eat while recovering, what socks match that shirt you like."
58113,Take care of yourself right now and look to the future.
58114,You’re getting to learn who you are now.
58115,"hey, we're all here for you!"
58116,There might be a spiritual advisor who you could talk to.
58117,"I imagine they'd still be willing to talk, even if you're not religious."
58118,"Hey sib, we support you always❤️"
58119,What country are you in?
58120,I’m a mom out here sending you love.
58121,"You’re brave, even though it’s unfair that you’ve had to be."
58122,💙
58123,Better help is a great resource it's US based Therapists but you can do phone calls or face time and it's weekly.
58124,It could be really helpful for you now since you're going through a lot of stressors.
58125,Good luck my darling.
58126,I'm proud of you taking your next step toward your authentic self.
58127,"It takes courage and is scary, so I'm proud that you're so brave doing this even without support because it gets you to where you need to be."
58128,"You will look back on this at a time in your life that is easier and you can breathe and you have people that love you for everything at you are, and you will recognise it as a painful but defining moment in your evolution."
58129,You're in your little cocoon now and my god will it be spectacular to see your true self unfold!
58130,Please do!
58131,I did 🤣
58132,Thank you ❤️
58133,It's okay if you need to cry.
58134,Letting it all out can be so freeing.
58135,Cry as much as you need to.
58136,You can write me any time if you want / need to.
58137,You are not alone.
58138,Take care and I hope you have a speedy recovery and that everything goes well.

58140,I’m crying too.
58141,💜
58142,I do!
58143,I was lucky to find an awesome husband.
58144,"We have an amazing daughter, and his mom became the mom I never had."
58145,I hope that you find what you’re looking for as well.
58146,Friends are the family we get to choose!
58147,You are in a hospital it is normal to want support especially from your own parents who should love you and accept you..but sometimes life is not fair.
58148,You took a step forward in your life and is good that you can take care of yourself.
58149,Wish you the best ;)
58150,"That it is, and I'm sure your life will continue to improve as well!"
58151,"<3

Good luck on your journey!"

58154,"Watch your fav shows, movies, etc."
58155,and just focus on your health.
58156,You got lots of support here so don’t worry about that ❤️
58157,I’m not sorry at all.
58158,"I had been in a lot of pain for about 4 years, and it’s AMAZING to be able to walk through the market without the pain!"
58159,I am SO jazzed to feel better.
58160,"I have a lot of muscle strength to recover, but that’s just an annoyance for me."
58161,"I can look back and see how much that pain had restricted me, even if I didn’t see at the time."
58162,"I hope you are able to look back in, say a years time, and know it was a jump to get over, to endure, (along with rest of the transition issues), and see that you have come through the worst of it."
58163,Be aware of how strong you are to have come this far!
58164,"It takes a lot of courage, IMO, to realize what was ‘wrong’ with you, and start the process to change things!"
58165,I think you’re a Impressive!
58166,What?
58167,That’s lame!
58168,So glad to hear you’re out now!
58169,"Take care of yourself in the coming days, and reach out to us here if you need more support."
58170,❤️
58171,Fair enough.
58172,"My intention was to reassure as I know all too well the niggling feeling of ""What's wrong with me that they don't care?"""
58173,and sometimes it helps to be reminded that you are not the reason they are the way they are.
58174,But I can see your point.
58175,Editing comment.
58176,"Sorry my love, I need more sons."
58177,"You will be my 4th son to my 4 daughters, evens me out."
58178,My oldest is trans mtf and the happiest I have ever seen her.
58179,"The most important thing to remember is be true to yourself, love yourself."
58180,Much love baby boy.
58181,Lots of love to you.
58182,❤️🧡💛💚💙💜❤️
58183,"Heating pad or ice pack (or alternating), whatever your health professional tells you."
58184,"Just had an op myself, and it helped so much with the pain."
58185,"Rooting for you, sweetheart!"
58186,Give the doggo a big head rub for me if you can 💙💙
58187,"I noticed that, and I can't even explain how grateful I am for this."
58188,"Hey here's an ice pack, go easy on yourself."
58189,I love you just the way you are.
58190,❤️ mom
58191,Thank you.
58192,💙💙
58193,I'm taking it slow!
58194,"I'm still giggling because someone tried to leave a nasty, transphobic comment on here, and somewhat they've been banned on the spot lol."
58195,"I'm feeling really sheltered here, and it's a feeling I don't think I've ever felt."
58196,"So yeah, really—thank you 💙"
58197,You are a very special parent to very lucky kids.
58198,"Keep being your amazing self, please 💛💛"
58199,please rest and drink lots of water.
58200,The stress of just plain old worrying about nothing will make your healing process last longer.
58201,let go and let gaga haha (Not religious as you can see)
58202,I hope you are doing better today and everything heals as it should.
58203,Thinking of you <3
58204,"Hey, we watch out for our kids and sibs here!"
58205,We don’t put up with that shit.
58206,I’m glad they were shut down so fast.
58207,Totally normal.
58208,Cats are very empathetic creatures.
58209,Their purring has even been shown to help humans when upset.
58210,Yes.
58211,Are you doing alright though?
58212,Do you want to talk about what's got you down?
58213,"It's normal, your cat loves you and wants to comfort you."
58214,Cats know us better than we think my baby boy (actually he's an old man now 10yrs last month) will follow me around and constantly come for cuddles when I'm stressed even when I'm doing my usual mum move of fake it til you make it mode so the kids don't see.
58215,"When my human gets so sad, I do what I can to make her glad."
58216,"When my human starts to weep,
I curl up on her and fall asleep

When her day is not the best, 
I sit myself down on her chest."
58217,"Because When she’s near I love to purr, my favorite spot is next to her :)"
58218,"Yes it is, it’s the cat’s way of comforting you."
58219,"Whenever I cry, my cat panics and doesn’t know what to do so she just forces her smal face into my face and just stares at me."
58220,They are angels.
58221,Totally normal.
58222,Kitty is trying to comfort you.
58223,The way they comfort themselves or other cats is to cuddle and purr.
58224,"Purring is healing (physically and mentally) for cats, and in humans the pitch/vibration of it has been shown to be calming."
58225,My cats follow me everywhere.
58226,It's rare to be in a room for more than 15 minutes without them showing up.
58227,"The other cats may not have done this with you because you weren't their ""person""."
58228,Only for cats who love their owners a LOT.
58229,you've got a good friend there <3
58230,The sound and frequency of a purring cat is very calming and soothing.
58231,It is their way of making sure your (bad) energy shifts to a more positive one.
58232,We have a cat who has never been very affectionate but if one of the kids is sick she’s cuddled up beside them and doesn’t leave until they’re better.
58233,I think this is the same.
58234,She knows you need her.
58235,Hey kiddo.
58236,She's giving you the love we wish we could give you.
58237,She's doing her job.
58238,Cats aren't as aloof as people believe.
58239,They're very sweet and empathetic animals usually.
58240,Yes!
58241,Absolutely normal kitty behavior.
58242,My cats always try and comfort me especially my oldest if they can tell I'm off or upset.
58243,"It is comforting, knowing I'm never alone."
58244,Your little one loves you very much 💖
58245,Cats are such amazing comforts!
58246,My therapist gave me paperwork making my cat an emotional support animal.
58247,Sometimes he’s the only thing that keeps me going.
58248,"Your baby loves you so, so much."
58249,Love on that baby and feel yourself heal♥️
58250,Kitty loves you very much
58251,Very normal!
58252,"What a good baby, giving you cuddles and comforts!"
58253,That’s loving kitty behavior.
58254,"Your kitty loves you a lot, you’re its human, and it wants to comfort you when you’re upset."
58255,"It’s not big enough to give you a big hug, so it does that."
58256,❤️
58257,"Yes, my love!"
58258,They are the very best at this.
58259,In high school my bf broke up with me on the phone and I cried so hard I puked.
58260,My kitty never left my lap.
58261,She had puke on her and just kept purring and comforting me.
58262,She lived to be 22 and even did this with my own kids.
58263,She’s just showing her empathy.
58264,That’s what the purr is for.
58265,"It calms her and other cats, so she’s using her magic on you."
58266,"Most animas don’t have a positive reinforcement sound, one that said “I love you, too!”  Kitties do."
58267,She knows it.
58268,She shows it.
58269,Never forget how special you are to her!
58270,"Science says she lowers blood pressure and evens your heart rate, and that purr releases endorphins in you both."
58271,Can’t fight the science!
58272,Or those purrs!
58273,Is a cat laying down normal kitty behavior?
58274,Yes it is!
58275,She probably picks up on your stress via the scent of cortisol
58276,"Aww, this is so wonderful to see."
58277,"I have an older cat that does this for me too, she always seems to know when I need comfort even if I'm trying not to show it."
58278,It means you have a nice strong bond with them!
58279,"I’ll tell you a story little sibling about when I had two kidney stones completely blocking my kidney, couldn’t pass urine, got infected it was a whole thing."
58280,Anyway I was laying in bed curled up in the fetal position praying for death and her comes my sweet little SugarBear jumped up on the bed with me and started licking my back where my kidney was causing me so much pain.
58281,After that she just sat there with me for like 2 hours and shortly afterwards I was able to pass the stones.
58282,So yes I think this is purrfectly normal as cats are actually fat fuzzy little angels.
58283,It's 100% normal.
58284,Cats are very protective of their humans and want them to be happy.
58285,I bet kitty does that thing where (s)he rubs the edge of their jaw against your face/hand/ankle too.
58286,"When they do that, they're marking you as their property."
58287,"There are two prevailing theories about why cats bring prey to their humans:

1) They're trying to feed you because they're grateful that you've been feeding them."
58288,"2) They're trying to say, ""See, stupid?"
58289,"That's what you're *supposed* to do."""
58290,"Personally, I prefer the second theory."
58291,Seems more cat-like to me.
58292,"Totally normal, what I've noticed with MY cat vs grandma's cats is that because I'm the one who feeds and cleans the litter box, I get way more cuddles."
58293,"Cats are incredibly empathetic, and also realize who their person is."
58294,I like to think they choose their soul mate humans.
58295,"I hope you're doing okay now, friend 💓"
58296,"Sib, your kitten is saying your its mom and that it wants you to BE better, not just feel it."
58297,"Feelings come and go, but the state of being stays."
58298,Baby here it comforting and healing its mamma.
58299,"Slowly but surely, the purring will be associated with kindness and love in your mind, just you wait."
58300,"Please, give scritches to the little cinnamon roll for me please!"
58301,I just read a post that made me tear up.
58302,Immediately after reading I shifted in my chair and popped my back.
58303,My cat heard and saw the sad look on my face and started calling to me as she ran over to cuddle me.
58304,Cats are amazingly empathetic.
58305,"When they bond to you, they will take care of you."
58306,This baby really loves you.
58307,"I've always called it ""cat therapy""."
58308,Kitties are the best.
58309,"I hope you're doing okay, remember to come here for mom help when you need it."
58310,"We're not cats, but we'll do our best."
58311,"She's doing her job, taking care of her human."
58312,"I'm sorry you're having a bad time, Sis."
58313,But it seems Kitty's doing a good job of caring for you.
58314,My late cat used to do this.
58315,I had him for 19 years.
58316,He would lick tears off of my face too.
58317,Glad you have a sweet baby.
58318,"Cats experience similar emotions to humans, sadness, depression, grief, happiness, boredom, affection, love, and so many more."
58319,They are also really good at reading our moods.
58320,Depending on the cats personality it's totally normal for them to comfort you when you are sick or sad.
58321,That just means you baby loves you and wants you to feel better.
58322,Edit to add.
58323,You can thank him by giving him lots of slow blinks.
58324,That's cat for I love you.
58325,Your kitty is extra special sib!
58326,They're one of the top tier comfort cuddlers!
58327,Yep!
58328,Cats are very perceptive and they’re very nurturing once they feel you’re trustworthy.
58329,My cat does this with me almost every night.
58330,Side note: my cuddly girl looks a lot like yours !
58331,Totally normal and totally lovable.
58332,Those paws!
58333,SO cute!
58334,Sometimes animals are much better than people.
58335,"It is, your sweet kitty is taking care of you."
58336,"Please give her kisses and pets  for me, she is doing a wonderful job."
58337,Is everything ok now honey?
58338,Sending hugs to you.
58339,"I call my cat Feline Klonopin, she can calm me down better than any drug or coping mechanism out there."
58340,Cats feel what you feel.
58341,"If you're crying, or sad just let that soft cuddle bug who's hopefully purring like an outboard motor calm you down."
58342,Normal for an empathetic kitty and so sweet.
58343,When I had surgery recently and was in quite a bit of pain two of mine spent every minute they could comforting me and even laying together on my lap which isn’t typical.
58344,Hope you feel better.
58345,"This kitty loves you, and so do I."
58346,"I have a cat rescue at my house, 11 cats and they stay with me until old age or sickness and then I rescue a new one."
58347,"Fat sassy and spoiled, and they each have their favorite human."
58348,"When the favorite human is sad or upset about things or sick, they cuddle, lick, knead, and love all over us."
58349,"In my case, I am the favorite human for maybe 7 or 8 of the cats, so they take turns, one cuddles and purrs, then the next one, then that one hops down and the next one."
58350,It's awesome.
58351,"It means you are their human, part of their clowder (that's a thing!)"
58352,and they are trying to make you better.
58353,I love cats!!!
58354,Hugs from a mom who has a lot of cats!
58355,My parrot does this.
58356,So do my kids.
58357,If someone loves you - they try to make you feel better.
58358,Totally normal for some cats.
58359,Some cats are completely indifferent to your emotions but others are very sensitive and caring and will give you all the cuddles to help.
58360,Be happy you have found yourself a cuddle bug who wants to make you feel better.
58361,Angel kitty behavior :)
58362,My daughter’s cat does the same love and cuddle when she is upset.
58363,Hope your years are dry now.
58364,"Aww, she loves you and knows you’re upset."
58365,Cats know.
58366,Not every kitty does this.
58367,Yours loves you very much.
58368,"My ginger boy does the same, she just loves you and doesn't like to see you upset."
58369,Cats truly are wonderful and have their people.
58370,"My mom's hates everyone unless shes not home, then he barely loves on everyone."
58371,yes!
58372,animals are very perceptive.
58373,when i’m upset or sick my baby tucks himself under my neck.
58374,"every cat is different but you seem to have a little snugglebug 🥰

[this](https://imgur.com/a/YNEwNzA) was when i had covid ♥️"
58375,"Yes, this is normal."
58376,"Animals have amazing senses and know when their human is upset, angry, happy, etc."
58377,"I hope you're feeling better, everything is going to be okay."
58378,It’s called love.
58379,Pets are so much better than many humans at it.
58380,Love heals .
58381,Mom is here for you!
58382,And your cat has recognized an amazing soul!
58383,My cat was great when I was upset.
58384,I’m happy you have an empathetic kitty.
58385,My tank of a cat comes and lays on my legs if my knee hurts and purrs.
58386,Like she's attempting to massage me.
58387,Hey sib.
58388,"Mileage may vary with different individuals, but a lot of cats can sense when their human is in distress and provide comfort."
58389,"I was just talking to my boyfriend about this, actually: he had a cat who would come up to him and comfort him whenever he was upset."
58390,"When she crossed the rainbow bridge, he didn't mourn her because, in his words, ""she wouldn't have wanted me to be sad""."
58391,"Cats can be little assholes sometimes, but when the chips are down they will really be there for you."
58392,Aw my babies!!
58393,I'm not a mom but I love this!
58394,my sweet old lady kitty always does this when anyone in our family is crying.
58395,she comes from wherever she is in the house to sit on our chests and lick our faces.
58396,it’s very normal and very sweet
58397,It’s so normal!
58398,"Cats are so in tune and loving, they just want to make sure you’re okay."
58399,"Some examples: My baby boops me until I look at her and smile, my other one lays on my chest until my breathing calms."
58400,"You’ve got yourself a loving, supportive baby."
58401,"She loves you just like you love her <3

PS hope you feel a bit better soon, and if you ever need, from one internet sister to another internet friend, feel free to message me."
58402,I’ll send cat pictures.
58403,"I lost my bunny suddenly last Friday, and have been all out of sorts since then."
58404,I haven't even been crying much because I think I'm still in denial of what happened.
58405,But cats can sense when we're not doing well.
58406,My kitty has been doing the exact thing that you're doing.
58407,I hope you're okay.
58408,"If you need to talk, let me know."
58409,Perfectly normal if you have an exceptional cat.
58410,It's the precious kitties that got me through pretty much everything!
58411,Normal and wonderful.
58412,My four kitties and I send our love to you both.
58413,What a sweet baby.
58414,My cat also comforts me when I'm upset - we're lucky to have such loyal companions.
58415,Totally normal dear
58416,Yep
58417,That’s GOOD kitty behavior!!!
58418,You have a bestie!
58419,Looks like that kitty loves you.
58420,"This actually shows that you are a kind, gentle, and good person."
58421,"Cats can sense this, and your cat feels safe, comfortable, and relaxed with you, enough to curl up around you and comfort you."
58422,"You have a lovely cat here, and your kitty is showing you that you are a lovely person, too."
58423,"Of course,  animals love and care."
58424,Your kitty loves you.
58425,Hi sis!
58426,"Fun fact of the day, the purr your cat makes as they lay on you is not only helping your heart stop racing but is helping to actually heal your body as well!"
58427,Your little friend here loves you so very much and this is their way of showing you affection and comfort.
58428,"Animals are so much smarter than we give them credit for, my pug does the same thing."
58429,Lots of love and if you need an ear I would be happy to listen ❤ love you sis
58430,That wonderful gorgeous furball's behavior is very much that of a loving furbaby who loves their caretaker very very much.
58431,Which just shows how amazing their caretaker is as well.
58432,"Take the love, cherish it and give that kitten even more love and many hugs from me as well."
58433,Hi baby.
58434,"*wipes tear from your cheek and pats your shoulder*

First of all, it’s okay to cry, but it hurts me to see you hurting."
58435,We can talk about what’s wrong when you’re ready.
58436,"Second, animals are very in tune with us- sometimes even before we realize how we ourselves are feeling."
58437,"It is normal, and know that your kitty loves you very much."
58438,And so do I. I love you and I’m here for you.
58439,She's beautiful.
58440,"My kitties ( we have 3 - mine, my husband's and my son's) like all of us and each have a special bond with their special human."
58441,"That said, I have chronic pain and when I have a bad pain day, I end up with two or three cats lying on me, which is made funnier by the fact that they normally just tolerate each other but don't usually get too close."
58442,"I am not upset about being a kitty pillow, it's quite nice."
58443,"Yes sweetheart, your four-legged brother does the same to me."
58444,Your kitty adores you & I’m so happy she is there for you in your time of need.
58445,Mom hugs.
58446,Absolutely!
58447,Pets are angels.
58448,Animals are very intuitive.
58449,"When I’d get upset and cry, My dog used to jump on my lap, stick his ass in my face and look back around at me expectantly like he was saying “petting me will make the sad go away”"
58450,There's nothing quite like a big orange cat to make life a little easier.
58451,Just a sweet caring kitty.
58452,Lucky girl.
58453,Hi baby.
58454,Sorry you're hurting.
58455,"Not only is this normal, but there's some evidence it may have actual healing effects (anecdotal, but, I choose to believe it!)."
58456,"https://www.purrfectpost.com/healing-purrs-how-your-cat-can-help-you-heal/#:~:text=Purring%20releases%20endorphins%20in%20cats,people%20cope%20with%20illness%2C%20too.&text=The%20same%20frequency%20has%20been,tendon%20repair%2C%20and%20wound%20healing."
58457,Totally normal!
58458,My house has 2 dogs and 3 kitties for just this reason.
58459,Our adult boy cat will force his way into the arms of anyone that's upset.
58460,He won't take no for an answer no matter how many times you push him away.
58461,Baby boy cat will follow them around the house and flop down at their feet and attempt to look as sad and/or cute as possible until he gets picked up and then will shove his face in their neck.
58462,Big girl cat will wait until they're alone and pin people's arm down and purr ferociously until they look less sad... Or pet her more.
58463,She's easily bribed.
58464,Kitties know when you're.
58465,"When you're sad and they have a good bond with you, they will try to make you feel better with loves."
58466,Hope you're feeling better soon.
58467,Totally normal.
58468,"I had a cat that acted like this, but she wrapped her legs around my arm and used my hand as her pillow."
58469,"My dearest, 
Mine does this also!!"
58470,I really believe that our cats can reach us on a spiritual level.
58471,Hope your tears become less often and your kitty gives you loads of cuddles!
58472,Love mum ❤
58473,Yes!!
58474,Your cat adores you.
58475,<3
58476,Yes very normal.
58477,"In a world where sometimes we don't feel love, our pets remind us what we mean to them."
58478,Beautiful kitty.
58479,Give kisses get purrs
58480,Many animals will try to love you better if they sense big emotions.
58481,Some are VERY hardwired to love you better.
58482,Let them.
58483,"Hugs to baby and you, if you'd like them!"
58484,That’s so sweet.
58485,I think it’s his/her way of comforting you and maybe protecting you
58486,It's entirely normal !
58487,Mine did this when I got into a car accident.
58488,It's ADORABLE kitty behavior OMG
58489,I had a cat as a child who would lick my tears off my cheeks.
58490,She was a sweet and nurturing cat.
58491,She actually got pregnant twice by the neighborhood tomcat (we got her fixed as soon as we could after the second pregnancy).
58492,She was a great mom to her kittens.
58493,"When she was 13, she ran away and never returned."
58494,I had a one year old kitten who came to me when I was crying about missing her.
58495,"He walked up to me, like he was going to do the same."
58496,"But he didn’t lick my tears, he sniffed them and then sneezed them at me."
58497,It was gross but it made me laugh.
58498,He ended up being a very affectionate cat too.
58499,I swear cats just know!
58500,❤️
58501,I was just wondering because none of my parents cats have done this before but my baby loves to cuddle my face when I’m upset.
58502,"Depends on the cat though, mine would run out of the room 😂"
58503,Yeah I’m okay just stressing about college and my therapist made me think about my childhood if you go on my page you’ll see my post.
58504,That’s so beautiful
58505,If I cry for too long after face cuddles she will lick my face and if that doesn’t work she bites my nose.
58506,Your sweet one really loves you.
58507,Some cats are single-people-kitties and will throw all of their love at one person.
58508,Looks like you're the chosen one.
58509,Your kitty adores you and can sense when you're upset so they're trying to comfort you.
58510,"It's really special, you guys have a strong bond."
58511,That's not unusual.
58512,"This particular cat seems to be bonded to you, that's why he's (most gingers are male, apologies if you've got a rare girl ginger) noticed and is trying to comfort you."
58513,"I had a ginger boy from 2001 until 2012, and he was an empath too."
58514,"I still have a dilute tortie girl born in 2006 I'm pretty sure she learned it from him, and she still does it."
58515,"When they were both alive, my lap and chest could get pretty crowded when I was sad."
58516,"My mom's ginger cat, although he'll sit on your lap if he's cold, has never been interested in snuggling with anyone when they're sad except for my mom."
58517,"If mom was upset, and she frequently was after her diagnosis, he magically materialized out of nowhere and plopped down on her lap and made biscuits until she stopped crying."
58518,He was a good kitty for her.
58519,"Give fuzzface a little scratch from me, wouldja?"
58520,::patpatpat::
58521,You're sad they fix with love.
58522,Kitty loves you.
58523,Good cat.
58524,They're choosing you as their human.
58525,[Cat bro sends his love](https://imgur.com/gallery/Rlr9cNF)
58526,My kitty used to do this to me when she was still alive.
58527,She'd hear me crying and come running with a toy to give me.
58528,"Then, she'd curl up in my arms, on my chest, or next to me until I had stopped crying."
58529,It just means your kitty loves you and wants to help you feel better.
58530,Some cats are just really good at knowing when they're needed.
58531,I used to have a cat who would rush to sit on anyone who cried and purr at them.
58532,Cats are so good.
58533,Please pet Princess Cinnamon for me!
58534,What is your cat’s name?
58535,Awww!
58536,I'm in a similiar situation.
58537,"My family's cats have been sweet and wonderful, but none of them have been ""mine."""
58538,"They enjoyed attention and would lay with me, but never on me or in constant contact with me."
58539,Enter Pooshi - a cat I adopted from a coworker.
58540,"Every night, here she comes to cuddle and lay beside me."
58541,She follows me.
58542,She hangs out in my office when the other cat (my mom's who I kept after she passed) isn't in here.
58543,"Every morning when she hears I'm awake, she comes to cuddle."
58544,"So yeah, you got a love bug there!"
58545,"You're her special person, she's bonded to you."
58546,Very normal and a great honor!
58547,🎖
58548,"Yep, ours do this when my pain gets really bad."
58549,Somehow they always know and come curling up against the sore spot and start purring.
58550,That kitty loves you very much!
58551,You are blessed to have this connection.
58552,"Cats can be pricks, but also very attached."
58553,"Lots of cats don’t do that but many do and IMO after decades of having many cats, the orange tabbies are very often the mega smugglers."
58554,😻
58555,"Aww, she really loves you."
58556,You’re her special person.
58557,They sit on our chest to comfort us.
58558,"I’ve never had a cat that was “mine” and did that with me, so you have a very special bond with your beautiful kitty-baby."
58559,"I’m sorry you’re crying and upset, but I’m glad kitty is there with you."
58560,"Cats really respond to their environment, if they’re in a loving, safe environment they tend to be more cuddly and interactive."
58561,"When the environment they’re in causes prolonged anxiety in the cat (loud sounds, being “punished” not having play time, etc) they tend to be more recluse and skittish."
58562,"Aww, sweetheart."
58563,I'm so sorry that you had to go through that as a kid!
58564,"Every child deserves to feel safe, loved, and supported."
58565,It's good that your therapist is working with you on this.
58566,"I know it's painful to go through, but having your therapist there to guide you on how to deal with those feelings is great!"
58567,Make sure you give your gorgeous kitty extra chin scratches for me!
58568,I'm sorry you're having a rough time.
58569,"Therapy is hard, but I'm proud of you for doing it."
58570,"The childhood stuff is hard to process, but that will help you get past it and move on."
58571,"It may take a while, but it will happen."
58572,You’re welcome :) she/he?
58573,reminds me of my little doggy who loves to give kisses when I’m sad.
58574,What a beautiful baby you have and I hope you guys continue to make each other happy!
58575,That is so adorable.
58576,"When I lay on my back and she is on top of me, if I talk too much when I cry, she just straight up puts her paw on my mouth to stop me from talking."
58577,Cat’s are amazing creatures.
58578,"Mine licks my face when I'm crying, too."
58579,Normally I wind up laughing a little and that helps a lot.
58580,I'm glad you've got a good friend in PC.
58581,My roommate has a sweet older kitty who has this same sort of sense.
58582,"If they’re upset, stressed, anxious, sad, kitty just needs to be ontop of them."
58583,"Lol it’s incredibly sweet, and every time I see if happen it makes my heart happy."
58584,My ginger baby is a girl and she’s a slight pastel as well.
58585,Not a need orange but a slight peach color
58586,Princess cinnamon
58587,My cat does the same damn thing but only when I breath too much on her.
58588,She either puts her paw on my mouth or plops her body on my face.
58589,She is so cute!
58590,"After a lifetime of experience with cats, I can tell you that behavior indicates she feels VERY bonded to you."
58591,I'm glad you have such a precious companion 💗
58592,You lucky duck!
58593,You have a rather rare kitty.
58594,Extra scritches and treats!
58595,:)
58596,Princess Cinnamon is very lucky to have your love!
58597,She’s loving you back!!
58598,!
58599,"Older bro needs you to go pet that kitty RIGHT NOW, and snuggle her neck a little, for good measure."
58600,I love that name!
58601,It really fits her :)
58602,"You are doing it, hold her and confirm you are there."
58603,I'm sorry.
58604,Sending you strength.
58605,Just hold her.
58606,If there's someone else she trusts have them come over.
58607,Encourage her to drink water or tea.
58608,She's going to get mad at you for not being as upset as she is.
58609,That's normal and it's because you're a safe outlet for her anger.
58610,Don't try to reason with her or argue with her.
58611,Let her talk about this as much as she needs to.
58612,Defend her against any idiots who try to tell her it was God's plan or other such shit.
58613,Ask her if she wants a memorial service and help her plan it.
58614,"Honey, I'm so sorry."
58615,Compassionate Friends is an organization that helps grieving parents.
58616,"Here is their page on miscarriage: [https://www.compassionatefriends.org/stillbirth-miscarriage-infant-death/](https://www.compassionatefriends.org/stillbirth-miscarriage-infant-death/)

Big hugs to you and your wife."
58617,Auntie
58618,Just continue to do what you're doing.
58619,Take care of yourself too.
58620,Make sure you're both eating SOMETHING.
58621,"I'm sorry, nobody should have to deal with this."
58622,Much love.
58623,My dear sweet boy and darling daughter-in-law.
58624,I’m sending you all my love.
58625,"By staying by her side, listening to her, and holding her, you are doing everything."
58626,"You need to grieve, too."
58627,Both of you be gentle on yourselves and take as long as you need.
58628,Do not listen to anyone who says you need to get over it or move on.
58629,Love you both.
58630,"Oh, my heart goes out to you both."
58631,I just want to send you great big hugs.
58632,You’ve been given a lot of great advice already.
58633,I just want to add some info about what your wife’s body might be going through the next couple of weeks.
58634,"The first week, I was barely functioning."
58635,I moved from the bed to the sofa and back again.
58636,I needed to replenish my iron and fluids.
58637,"The second week, my hormones were trying to regulate themselves so I had a lot of headaches."
58638,I didn’t go back to work until the third week - I recognize this was very privileged.
58639,Her cycles are likely to be irregular for a few months.
58640,Sending all my love to you both.
58641,So very sorry this happened to you and your family!
58642,Counseling will be so important for both of you.
58643,You have both experienced a loss.
58644,"It is important to continue to eat, drink, sleep and use the bathroom, even if you don’t want to."
58645,"Cereal or nuts, eat something."
58646,Prayers for healing & strength for your journey!!
58647,💞
58648,"I am so sorry for your loss, honey."
58649,That is absolutely gut wrenching and there are few things in the world as painful as grieving a child.
58650,It sounds like you’re doing an excellent job supporting her and yourself.
58651,Things are going to be tough for a while — possibly a long while.
58652,"A grief counselor is a great start, and your local hospital or church may offer a miscarriage support group that may help both of you."
58653,"In the meantime, invite family and friends to share your pain and help hold you up - I guarantee they’ll be happy to lend a listening ear, company, or some help around the house while you heal."
58654,This is not a time to be alone.
58655,"Also, make sure you both drink enough water."
58656,All that crying can lead to dehydration.
58657,"And just hold each other close, love."
58658,"No one expects you to be okay right now, and I’m sending you so much love."
58659,"Oh duckling, that’s so sad and hard for you both."
58660,At this point all you can do is show how much you love her.
58661,Let her cry and cry with her.
58662,"Hug her to bits, warm bathes maybe, favorite foods."
58663,Are your relationships supportive?
58664,Can family or friends also love on her?
58665,And don’t forget that this also affects you.
58666,She needs love and support but so do you.
58667,Love her as much as you can but also let her love on you.
58668,I’m sending you both hugs and love and support.
58669,Wish I could be there for you both.
58670,I'm so very sorry for your loss.
58671,You are doing all the right things.
58672,There are no magical words or deeds that can help.
58673,"I'm sending you both my love, my strength and healing energy."
58674,Take all the time you need.
58675,Many many hugs.
58676,Hugs for you both.
58677,"You are doing the right things, and have good advice here."
58678,The advice I don’t see is that YOU are also grieving and need support and comfort.
58679,"Your wife is suffering the medical and hormonal fallout of the miscarriage, which is important to keep in mind, but you BOTH are suffering the loss."
58680,Your emotional health is equally as important as your wife’s.
58681,"You may encounter people who don’t realize that you are also suffering, and I’m so sorry."
58682,"If you have your own support system of friends and family, now is a good time to let them know if you need them."
58683,"It sounds like y’all may need someone to bring meals, which is a common way to support a grieving family."
58684,There is no right or wrong way to grieve.
58685,Just ride the grief and let yourself process at your own pace and in your own way.
58686,"Let yourself feel whatever you need to feel, and cry or don’t or pace or walk or scream - however you are motivated to process."
58687,Talk to your wife: both of y’all give and receive support and validation from each other.
58688,Y’all will get through this *together*.
58689,The most important thing anyone ever did for me was hold space for whatever I was feeling.
58690,"My grief was jagged and overwhelming, and some people handled it better than others."
58691,"Give her support, but remember that you are grieving too."
58692,"Your loss isn't less, just different, and you deserve space for your grief too."
58693,"If she can't do that for you right now, remember to reach out to friends and loved ones."
58694,"Let them know you're hurting and need support, and let them know if you need help supporting your wife."
58695,Our journey has now spanned over two years and included a long battle with PTSD symptoms associated with the miscarriage.
58696,It's okay to not be okay.
58697,"Find a therapist or counselor to support you, and seek out someone knowledgeable about trauma if either of you find the experience becoming overwhelming or intrusive."
58698,"It's okay to feel whatever you are feeling, but definitely give yourselves a chance to process things before you decide what to do next."
58699,"We eventually realized that we both needed to pour our energy into healing our mental health, and I had to confront a lot of fears and misconceptions that I didn't even realize I had."
58700,"We eventually decided to not try again, in part because the risk of another equally traumatic miscarriage is extremely high in our case."
58701,"We have been through enough, and we will figure out a fulfilling life without children."
58702,"It's okay to try again if it feels right to do so, but it's equally valid to say, no, we won't try again."
58703,"Be kind to yourselves and know that whatever you decide to do, that's perfectly fine."
58704,I’m so sorry!
58705,"I’ve gone thru the same thing(I lost my 3rd baby to an ectopic pregnancy at 15wks) and the best advise I can give, is let yourselves feel the hurt."
58706,Feel every emotion fully.
58707,You and your wife are in my thoughts and prayers ♥️
58708,[deleted]
58709,You're doing it already.
58710,Jumping on grief counseling is a great decision.
58711,"For now,  hold her."
58712,Cry with her.
58713,Don't try to be strong.
58714,"Let her know you're there with her, in the muck."
58715,Grieve together.
58716,"It's going to hurt like hell, but you'll find your new normal."
58717,Don't let people rush you through the grief.
58718,The only thing that can soften the edges is time.
58719,"Lean on your family, if they'll let you."
58720,Please try to eat something.
58721,"At least, try to stay hydrated."
58722,Grieving is exhausting work.
58723,You'll need the energy.
58724,Huge hugs to you both.
58725,I’m so sorry for your loss :(
58726,Hey!
58727,Sister here as opposed to mum.
58728,I’m so sorry to hear about your loss.
58729,I can’t imagine how tough this much be for you.
58730,"You said you told your best friend, and family members."
58731,"If they live close by, maybe you could ask them to make you guys some dinners so you don’t have to worry about that (just cos you said you’ve not eaten yet)."
58732,Are her family close by?
58733,Are her close friends close by?
58734,Maybe you could talk to them?
58735,"I’m so proud of you for reaching out and asking for help, I imagine this is something that is so so tough for you and it’s so wonderful that you’re trying to look after her, but remember you also have to look after yourself!"
58736,"Sending you and your wife all the love in the world, and I hope you’re able to take care of yourselves ♥️"
58737,Hey sib.
58738,I’m so sorry for your loss.
58739,"I’ve had a few MC’s myself and it is the hardest thing to go through because sometimes you don’t know what will help make you feel better, at least I didn’t know what I needed."
58740,"I would’ve appreciated being asked how I am, having dinner made for me, help with housework, back rubs, sometimes no touching at all."
58741,Ask your wife what she needs.
58742,"If she’s unable to tell you, just take her lead."
58743,It hurts both physically and emotionally.
58744,"Even after a few weeks or months, keep asking how she’s doing (sporadically)."
58745,It’s nice to know you’re still thought of and the baby you had is still thought of.
58746,"It’s great you’re worried about your wife, but please also take time to work through your own feelings and needs at this time too."
58747,I am so sorry 🥺🥺
58748,I'm so sorry for what you're going through.
58749,I've personally had a number of miscarriages.
58750,"Everyone handles it differently, but each time I felt surprisingly vulnerable."
58751,"Sometimes I just needed to be physically close to someone, just be held."
58752,It sounds like you're already doing that for her.
58753,"Keep in mind too, not only is she going through the emotional challenge of processing this, but also experiencing hormone withdrawal."
58754,"Most women go through the 'baby blues' after they deliver, where they are often very depressed and prone to crying easily."
58755,"This also happens with miscarriage, and obviously without the happy counterbalance of a baby."
58756,"To be clear, I'm not saying her emotions are because of her hormones, just that they're adding cruel insult to injury."
58757,"In my experiences with my losses, I knew I was just going to be sad and sometimes inconsolable for 1-2 weeks before I was even going to think like myself enough to truly process the grief."
58758,I offer this in case it's helpful with what to expect.
58759,"Give yourselves patience and time, and lean into each other."
58760,"Ask her what she wants and needs, there's no right answer."
58761,No easy answers in this situation either.
58762,*Hugs*.
58763,Hold her.
58764,"Make her surroundings as comfortable for her as you can - comfort foods, fluffy blankets,  hot water bottles if she wants, maybe a bath with a nice scent?"
58765,Comfort movies if she has those.
58766,"Otherwise,  talk if she offers."
58767,This is going to take some time and _both_ if you will grieve.
58768,It’s okay to be under the wave.
58769,Be tender and loving.
58770,Breathe.
58771,Try to drink water.
58772,Try to love calmly.
58773,It’s ok to be in a state of devastation.
58774,Validation.
58775,Reach out and ask people to help w meals.
58776,Cry your ass right off w her.
58777,Try to sleep.
58778,Watch a calm movie.
58779,Read her a book.
58780,Bring her tea.
58781,Candles any thing soothing.
58782,Be in the moment under the wave.
58783,Brush her hair.
58784,Sleep.
58785,Look for the love under the wave.
58786,Look for the beautiful things like kindness and helpers.
58787,Listen.
58788,Ask her if she wants a memorial.
58789,Mourning hurts.
58790,It’s okay to feel this way.
58791,It’s okay to be under the wave.
58792,The intensity will relent.
58793,And sometimes it will crash in hard.
58794,Hold each other and feel.
58795,I’m sorry for the loss of your baby.
58796,No words can lessen the pain.
58797,Under the wave is hard.
58798,Feel all the feelings you both have.
58799,Take care of yourself as much as possible.
58800,Pour in to each other.
58801,Let the tears flow.
58802,Get help from helpful people.
58803,Do what you need to to mourn.
58804,Sending love on your journey.
58805,Proud of the way you are already showing her love.
58806,I’m so incredibly sorry for this loss.
58807,Grieving of children is beyond difficult.
58808,It’s okay to not be okay
58809,"My sweet friend

You are doing what you supposed to."
58810,Be there.
58811,Hold her.
58812,Listen to her.
58813,Give her space when she needs it.
58814,Give her whatever she needs to be comfortable while grieving.
58815,What about you?
58816,Are you okay?
58817,How are you feeling?
58818,I’m so sorry for you and your wife’s loss honey.
58819,You’re doing everything right.
58820,"Holding her, grieving with her, contacting a grief counselor and letting her know how much you love her."
58821,"But honey, how are you holding up?"
58822,Are you ok?
58823,Here is a big {{{{{hug}}}}} for you.
58824,Know that you too are loved.
58825,From personal experience I know this pain.
58826,And sweetie I’m so sorry the two of you have to experience this.
58827,I know you were taken by surprise by the pregnancy but were overcome with a sense of love for the life you two created.
58828,Make sure you allow yourself to mourn that loss.
58829,I’m sure the pain you feel right now is a feeling unlike one you’ve ever felt before.
58830,"Do something special, the two of you to remember the life you created."
58831,"Get her a piece a jewelry,(with the baby’s  birth stone)- if it’s within budget, plant a tree in the baby’s memory, (something small- it’s the memory your creating ) and if it will help you (it did me) name your child and create a remembrance book, (write a letter, to get ur emotions out, your thoughts and dreams for this child you had begun planning for) or get a memorial plaque but do SOMETHING."
58832,You lost a child.
58833,A piece of your heart.
58834,You will heal.
58835,"And I do promise you honey it will get better, for both of you ❤️."
58836,Unfortunately you have to go through this pain.
58837,I’m so terribly sorry that you have to.
58838,I’m very grateful that you have each other to comfort.
58839,"And lastly, and I know I’ll probably get some downvotes and be called sexist."
58840,But honey you’re going to need to be strong for her.
58841,She’s going to need your strength (and love).
58842,"Not to say your pain isn’t God awful, I."
58843,But hers is worse.
58844,She might blame herself (not her fault) she might ask if it was something she did (it wasn’t) and she’s going to need you to be the stronger one to tell her you love her and to help keep her shit together.
58845,But not today or even tomorrow.
58846,"For now cry, get it all out honey."
58847,Sending strength and love ❤️ (sorry for the long reply )
58848,I am so sorry.
58849,(Hugs)
58850,"I'm so, so sorry this happened to you both."
58851,"I don't want to diminish your completely valid feelings but you asked what you can do for her, and mentioned neither of you had eaten."
58852,She is bleeding heavily.
58853,"She needs water and nutrients, with a focus on iron."
58854,Please make sure you're both hydrated... That is the most important thing.
58855,"Then, give yourselves time to grieve."
58856,My deepest condolences to you both.
58857,"Oh honey, I am so very sorry for your loss."
58858,Hi sweetheart.
58859,My heart hurts for you and your wife.
58860,I believe your are doing exactly what you need to do for her - just be there.
58861,"Hold her, let her cry but remember to let yourself feel too."
58862,💜
58863,It's just going to hurt for a long time.
58864,"I'm so sorry, to both of you."
58865,"Just keep on spending time with her, encourage her to eat or drink anything (really, if all she wants is the same thing over and over and its junk, it's still way better than nothing), see if maybe keeping some background noise on will help keep the worst thoughts away for now...maybe replay some episodes or shows of something you have always liked watching or listening to."
58866,"Even if she isn't really paying attention, it might just be better than sitting in the quiet."
58867,"Remind her it wasn't her fault, it wasn't something you could have controlled, and she can feel however she feels for as long as she does."
58868,"You, too, OP."
58869,You do what you need to do.
58870,"Keep that grief counselor appointment, and take it all one day at a time."
58871,"I’m so sorry, I know how horrible this is."
58872,You are doing everything right.
58873,The best thing you can do is to Be there for each other.
58874,You can’t fix this for her.
58875,Let her cry and work through this.
58876,This is a process.
58877,"You will each grieve differently and will feel loss differently, because you are different people."
58878,My advice is not to judge your partner’s pace working through this grief.
58879,"As time passes, both of you will deal with it in your own time and in your own way."
58880,Be there for each other.
58881,"There aren't words to say, actions to do or people to fix whats happened."
58882,"But my friend, you're doing exactly what you must."
58883,"Just be there, hold her tight."
58884,Let her know (without saying it) you're not going anywhere.
58885,Dont give advice.
58886,Dont give platitudes.
58887,Those suck.
58888,Give you.
58889,Just be there man.
58890,I'm so sorry for your loss.
58891,Just be there for her and assure her that it was no one's fault.
58892,Some women blame themselves when it's just nature's way of realizing something was wrong.
58893,It's absolutely nothing she or you did.
58894,"Oh ducky, I’m sorry."
58895,Not everything we want comes about the way we think it should.
58896,Take your time to grieve.
58897,Talk to a counselor.
58898,Get everything out in the open between you.
58899,"If you think you’ve completely changed your stance on the child free life, try again."
58900,"If you want to take this as your sign that it wasn’t meant to be, that’s okay."
58901,Communicate and comfort each other.
58902,That’s all you can do at first.
58903,"Also, everyone grieves differently and for longer or shorter than others."
58904,Check in regularly together.
58905,"You love each other, and that almost baby is just that: almost a baby."
58906,You can have a lot of “almosts” until the perfect fit happens.
58907,"Keep your chin up, you’re doing great already."
58908,"Sib, my heart is breaking for you and wife."
58909,"Her hormones are going to be a mess, and the best answer is to just accept it for a bit."
58910,"Hold her if she wants, and I swear if she rages, it’s just because you are a safe outlet for the emotions."
58911,Internet hugs from your anon sister.
58912,I’m so sorry.
58913,I’ve been where you are twice and there’s nothing so devastating as those horrible words.
58914,There are those over at r/babyloss who can offer support and a sense of community.
58915,All you have to do is be there.
58916,"Give her space to grieve if she wants it, invade her space if she needs that."
58917,The most important thing here is communication.
58918,"Saying, “I’m here if you want to talk or not talk, just know I’m here.” It’s also important to talk about your own feelings."
58919,The other partner tends to be forgotten on occasion while everyone is focusing on the one who experienced the loss first hand.
58920,I personally joined BetterHelp.
58921,It’s covered through our HSA and had been instrumental in finding coping mechanisms to get through the day to day.
58922,"The first few days after feel impossible, and that’s okay."
58923,It’s okay to dwell in the impossible.
58924,"You lost a baby, a member of your family."
58925,That deserves your grief.
58926,"There is no moving on, there is only forward."
58927,This is not something either of you deserve.
58928,You did nothing wrong.
58929,This is not your fault.
58930,Its not your wife’s fault.
58931,"I repeat, because it’s important for you to read this twice: *it is not your fault*."
58932,"If you need anything, don’t hesitate to DM me."
58933,I'm so sorry for your loss.
58934,That's the worst loss one person can go though.
58935,Just be with her and keep telling her how much you love her.
58936,It's gonna be hard for you both but with time it hurts a little less.
58937,My heart is with you.
58938,Sibling here.
58939,"I have been in those shoes, unfortunately."
58940,It is impossibly difficult and painful.
58941,Something that helped me get through it was to remember that everyone grieves differently.
58942,That allowed me to be gracious to myself and to my husband.
58943,"We are about 10 months past the loss of our baby, and it still hurts."
58944,I don't think it will ever stop hurting.
58945,But it isn't all-consuming anymore.
58946,"Take one day at a time, and if that is too much, take one moment at a time."
58947,Sending you big hugs across the Internet.
58948,This is a very real loss that is hard for so many people to understand.
58949,Lean on each other and your support system.
58950,Take care of yourself.
58951,"Drink water, get outside, pet an animal."
58952,Be easy on yourself.
58953,Listen to your wife without trying to solve her sadness.
58954,"I know that can be hard when husbands like to be fixers, but this is not a situation that can be fixed."
58955,Ride the waves of grief and love her and love yourself.
58956,I’m so sorry.
58957,I’m sorry hon.
58958,This isn’t easy on anyone.
58959,"You’re already doing great, being there for your wife."
58960,Please don’t take on the burden of blame like how she might.
58961,"Nobody caused this, and you didn’t know."
58962,"It’s okay to feel a range of emotions, even relief at the idea of going back to the original life plan."
58963,"There’s nothing wrong with feeling things, okay?"
58964,Take a bit and see if a memorial would be something you both want.
58965,I’m so sorry for your heartbreaking loss.
58966,Thank you for being a good husband and dad.
58967,Realize that this is a loss you’ll both  never completely get over.
58968,Treat it as such.
58969,Take plenty of time off work.
58970,Have a funeral if that helps.
58971,Definitely ask for comfort from caring family and friends.
58972,Maybe plant a tree or bush.
58973,"Also, really think of your wife at the holidays."
58974,She will mourn the baby at each one—maybe donate a gift in baby’s honor to a baby that needs essentials.
58975,Especially consider your wife on Mother’s Day.
58976,Ask her beforehand what she wants to do.
58977,Flowers and dinner for sure.
58978,You are both parents and that won’t stop.
58979,I’m so sorry!
58980,Sending hugs!
58981,I’ve lost two.
58982,She needs you to be there for her.
58983,This is a difficult time for your marriage and can either make the foundation or force it to crumble.
58984,A lot of that depends on you.
58985,She’s going to need a lot of love.
58986,Your home has just become her personal retreat.
58987,All that shit she’s been bothering you to do?
58988,Get it done.
58989,"Socks on the floor, not at your house."
58990,Cooking dinner for her?
58991,"Yes please

Telling her she’s the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen and you are so proud of her for taking care of your baby while they were here."
58992,Yes.
58993,Miscarriage can be very random.
58994,"I lost two and had a perfectly healthy baby on #3 

She needs to be loved, held etc."
58995,keep in mind she could go through post pardom depression and her hormones could shift her moods around.
58996,Just be super supportive and get her help if she needs it
58997,I'm sorry for your loss.
58998,"[This might help](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3921195/) 

TL(or dry)DR: Her body most likely still carries the DNA from your pregnancy."
58999,The cells from a fetus find their way into the mother's body during pregnancy regardless of the outcome of the pregnancy.
59000,The DNA can be detected within the mother years afterward.
59001,Current thinking is that those cells change the mother's immune system and maybe brain too.
59002,Her baby remains a part of her.
59003,-a dad
59004,"Oh sweetheart, I’m so sorry."
59005,It’s a heartbreaking loss.
59006,Keep being there for her and validating her feelings.
59007,That’s all you can do.
59008,I’ve had two myself.
59009,"For the first, I was with a terrible partner who didn’t even visit me in the hospital."
59010,He even blamed me for the miscarriage.
59011,"With my second, ten years later, my husband rushed to the hospital to be with me and mourned openly, even though it was unplanned and unexpected."
59012,"This all to say that just by being there for her, you are doing an amazing job."
59013,This does hurt.
59014,It will hurt.
59015,But it won’t be so raw forever.
59016,Just be there.
59017,That’s all you can do.
59018,A mothers grief is like no other and it just takes time.
59019,I found a beautiful picture and put my ultrasound photo behind it in the frame and put it in our family room that way the little one is always with us.
59020,Whatever she needs to remember your little one let her do.
59021,Love her.
59022,Hug her.
59023,Be there.
59024,There is no more than that.
59025,Just be with her.
59026,That's all that matters.
59027,But remember that you are grieving too.
59028,"If you need help, please allow yourself to ask for support."
59029,"It can be from her, but you can also ask your family and best friend."
59030,I'm so sorry.
59031,You're already doing the right thing - being there for her and caring for her.
59032,Let her take all the time to grieve she needs.
59033,You as well.
59034,"Sister here, I’m so sorry for your pain."
59035,"Just be with her, acknowledge the pain, and tell her you will just be by her side."
59036,"I have never gone through this, but as a woman I will tell you what I would like my fiance to do in this situation."
59037,"Take over the medical calls whenever possible, try to take over some of the duties around the house like cooking and cleaning, start her a bath and ask if she would like you to sit with her or leave her to relax, massages."
59038,Just be present.
59039,Check in with her.
59040,We are less likely to put effort into caring for ourselves when we are grieving.
59041,But please understand you are also going through this loss.
59042,You aren't superman.
59043,"Some people, myself included, will process grief in a very delayed way."
59044,"I will clean the entire house, cook every meal, etc."
59045,"The second I stop moving, I break."
59046,Allow yourself to feel.
59047,I'm so incredibly sorry this happened.
59048,A multiple miscarriage survivor here.
59049,Fwiw.
59050,Being there.
59051,Or not.
59052,"Giving her time to cry on your shoulder, but also space to be alone if she needs it."
59053,I personally wanted to mostly be alone.
59054,It was just what I needed in those moments.
59055,"Plus, I was worried that my grief would simply be way too my for my husband."
59056,Once he went back to work I often screamed in the shower just to let it out.
59057,"If he was home, I'd just sit and sob in the shower."
59058,Express your own grief too.
59059,It's ok to do that.
59060,Understand that once the physical part is over that it will take a lot longer for the emotional part.
59061,It could be a few weeks.
59062,Or a few months.
59063,Up to a year even.
59064,And expect tough days in your due date and on the anniversary of the loss.
59065,She may want to try again soon.
59066,You'll both need to de ode if you wish to do so.
59067,Don't just agree in order to make her happy.
59068,For the moment tho - her favorite foods.
59069,Especially things you aren't supposed to eat while pregnant!
59070,Sushi.
59071,Sweets.
59072,Wine or whatever alcohol she enjoys.
59073,Rare steak or burgers.
59074,Just anything that tells her you are thinking about her even in the small details.
59075,A journal for her to write in.
59076,Maybe there's a grief journal to be had someplace.
59077,Connecting her with a group of women who have also suffered loss.
59078,There are lots of subreddits or online groups for women who've had a pregnancy loss.
59079,"Letting her know that her feelings, whatever they are, are valid."
59080,"She may feel sad one moment, then happy the next, then guilty for being happy."
59081,Let her know that whatever she's feeling that you are there for it all no matter what.
59082,For me it helped to name my lost children.
59083,"Gale, Grace/Grayson, Cecily, Angel, Robin, and Wren."
59084,Robin was our toughest loss at 13 weeks.
59085,Look up the circle of grief.
59086,Don't allow people to vent their grief to your wife.
59087,"People should only ever vent outwards in the circle, never inwards."
59088,Don't let people say stupid things to her without stepping in.
59089,- oh it all happens for a reason - no.
59090,No it doesn't.
59091,There is nowhere in the Bible that says this.
59092,"-oh it's for the best, that baby wouldn't have been healthy!"
59093,- ok?
59094,Who cares.
59095,THIS baby was already loved and wanted regardless.
59096,- oh why are you upset?
59097,It was barely a cluster of cells?
59098,- science shows that a pregnancy loss at any stage hits as hard as a late pregnancy loss or childbirth loss.
59099,"If you think otherwise then you obviously haven't read the research

- oh you can always try again next month or next year - we will cross that road when we come to it."
59100,"For now, please just sit with us in our grief and support us instead of rugsweeping how we feel."
59101,People try to be kind and try to say the right things.
59102,But grief and especially pregnancy loss makes people uncomfortable and we are a society that abhors discomfort.
59103,Most people avoid it at all costs.
59104,That's why most people don't even know how to just sit beside someone experiencing grief.
59105,They have zero clue how to act or what to say beyond trite and hurtful sayings often.
59106,So don't be too offended.
59107,But also let your wife know that those trite sayings that hurt her heart are not ok and that you see and feel both her pain and your own.
59108,I'm so sorry for your loss.
59109,The loss of hopes and dreams.
59110,The loss of a future with a child you had come to live and be joyful for.
59111,The loss of a spirit that surrounded you.
59112,The loss of the expectations that the experience of being a parent would have for you.
59113,I'm sorry for the pain.
59114,And the sorrow.
59115,Know that many couple experience loss.
59116,"You are in no way alone, though it may feel that way."
59117,At least 1/4 of all couples experience a miscarriage.
59118,Gentle hugs for both of you.
59119,My heart breaks for you.
59120,You both deserve time to yourselves to grieve.
59121,"If there's someone you both trust, ask them to check on you both frequently."
59122,Stay hydrated and try to eat.
59123,"It's going to be ****ing difficult to move forward, but you need each other right now."
59124,"Try not to push each other away, it happens to the best of us."
59125,"You'll be ok, love."
59126,You're mourning 'what might have been'.
59127,It's a bitter and harsh loss.
59128,A lot of pregnancies terminate themselves if cells don't do the one-in-a-million perfect splits.
59129,"Nature kind of knows what she's doing, but she's a harsh b-word."
59130,Hug each other.
59131,You still have no idea what the future holds.
59132,"You'll have an amazing adventure together, it'll just be a different one."
59133,"I promise, you'll be ok.  Be sad for what might have been, but don't blame yourselves."
59134,It just wasn't the right circumstances.
59135,I'm so sorry you're both hurting.
59136,"As a grandma, I'm a bit of an authority on hugs, and I'm giving both of you my warmest, coziest, cry-until-you're-done grandma hugs."
59137,"And as a grandma, I promise you can get through this together."
59138,"Sibling here, I’m so sorry for your loss."
59139,"You are being an amazing partner to your wife, but please take care of yourself too."
59140,She needs you now but also in the future.
59141,You need to grief and take care of yourself so you can be there in the long run.
59142,Sending hugs and love.
59143,"I'm so sorry for your loss, you are doing the right thing, just hold her and cry together."
59144,"Make sure you take time for yourself as well, you are both grieving"
59145,Your doing it baby.
59146,"Hold her, cry with her, order comfort delivered."
59147,You both need time to grieve and deal with the loss.
59148,I'm so sorry you both are going through this horrible life event.
59149,Love each other and find your way.
59150,Big hugs.
59151,Aww you guys.
59152,I'm so sorry.
59153,It's hard when anything you were planning for doesn't happen.
59154,You are doing what you can.
59155,It's going to be hard and long.
59156,You two have each other.
59157,Don't forget that.
59158,"Hugs, sib."
59159,I'm so sorry for your loss.
59160,Grief is love that you can't physically give.
59161,So grieve together.
59162,"Because the two of you putting your love into the universe, means that your love, your energy, will meet up with the energy of your baby."
59163,It's ok to feel all the feelings right now.
59164,"So many hugs, so much love your way."
59165,"My heart is heavy for you, sweetheart."
59166,But you are doing exactly what she needs right now.
59167,Showing that you are also grieving with her and you are there for her.
59168,You are taking such good care of her.
59169,Plus you are Taking care of your mental health as well.
59170,I’m proud of you for taking those steps.
59171,"These moments can feel so isolating as a mom, but you are reminding her that you are here for her to lean on."
59172,"Maybe in the mean time, you could plan out a special night for you and her?"
59173,Maybe a cute little scavenger hunt around the city to your favourite spots.
59174,Or going to the store and picking up everything that reminds you of her.
59175,"Her favourite salty snacks, sweet snack, fun drinks, candles, magazines, maybe a cute comfy PJ set and fuzzy socks."
59176,And have a chill night in.
59177,I can see how much you love her.
59178,You are doing so great and I’m so sorry for your loss.
59179,"Oh my lord, sweetie, I'm so sorry."
59180,"So, so sorry."
59181,What a traumatic thing to go through.
59182,"I have no advice, other than that counselor, and work on being kind to each other."
59183,Hugs.
59184,I'm so so sorry for your loss.
59185,"Postpartum Support International runs online support groups, and they have a [pregnancy and infant loss support group for parents](https://www.postpartum.net/get-help/psi-online-support-meetings/#toggle-id-26) and one [just for moms](https://www.postpartum.net/get-help/psi-online-support-meetings/#toggle-id-25)."
59186,"I've heard really good things about their groups, and they are free."
59187,I'm thinking of you and your wife and sending you both love.
59188,I'm so so sorry.
59189,>I don't know what to do for her in the meantime.
59190,"This is all you can do right now, this and try to take care of yourself, too."
59191,"If there are people who can maybe make a few meals for you guys, I'm sure said people would be glad to help."
59192,It’s like you were robbed and there’s no 9-1-1 for that.
59193,I’ve been there.
59194,It’s absolutely heart shattering and I know your wife will be like a broken little bird for quite a while.
59195,You will probably catch yourself forgetting to inhale.
59196,I had to write a reminder on my hand.
59197,"I can only offer a virtual hug and tell you it will get better, but for now allow yourselves to grieve."
59198,Ahhhh I am so very sorry for the two of you.
59199,"As others have said, you are doing what you can, and it will be enough."
59200,You'll love each other through this.
59201,"If possible, both of you should take time off of work and other responsibilities."
59202,Even a few days will help.
59203,"Personally I think a soothing tea (I like peppermint and chamomile) with a bit of honey, maybe lemon, is comforting."
59204,Making and drinking tea can be a calming ritual.
59205,"Probably let your wife lead the way on what she wants, but a ritual for your lost baby can help give some closure."
59206,"Sweetie, You are doing good."
59207,"Plan for her to grieve longer than you, and don’t expect her to be done grieving because you are."
59208,"Maybe tomorrow make her a bubble bath, if the doctor said a bath is okay."
59209,Wash her hair.
59210,Brush it out.
59211,Just help her take care of herself because she probably doesn’t feel like taking care of herself.
59212,I'm sorry you're going through this.
59213,I have been there myself and it is terrible.
59214,"First, make sure she is eating."
59215,Doesn't matter what as long as she eats something.
59216,And you too.
59217,Eat whatever you are feeling like.
59218,I only wanted cinnamon buns.
59219,So that's what I ate.
59220,"Second, you both could, or one of you could, feel this loss for a very long time."
59221,"Third, figure out where you are going to go from here."
59222,You mentioned that you had planned to be child free but then warmed up to this unexpected pregnancy.
59223,"You both may now want a child, one of you may want a child and the other may not."
59224,But this is a conversation you need to have.
59225,I would have it soon.
59226,Our baby was planned so I don't have advice here.
59227,"Fourth, this isn't either of your faults."
59228,This unfortunately happens and unfortunately happens often.
59229,"1 in 4 will have a pregnancy loss, and they think that the number is even higher because so many people will have an early loss and will never know."
59230,It was likely caused due to a trisomy that was incompatible with life.
59231,Take your time grieving but it does get better.
59232,And it does get easier.
59233,And that's ok.
59234,It is ok to move forward with your life.
59235,This will be one of the strangest losses you will ever experience.
59236,You are grieving something that never existed on this earth.
59237,"Something you never physically saw, touched etc, but that you loved more than you can describe."
59238,It's a difficult type of loss.
59239,And people who haven't been through it do not understand.
59240,Ignore them.
59241,People that you didn't know had gone through this will reach out to you.
59242,Utilize them when you need them.
59243,You will be shocked by what some people say.
59244,Again.
59245,Ignore them.
59246,Again.
59247,I'm sorry you're going through this.
59248,There is a subrebbit r/miscarriage that might be able to help as well.
59249,Take it easy.
59250,Grieve.
59251,Eat.
59252,Sleep.
59253,Watch movies etc.
59254,It's ok to be angry.
59255,It's ok to be sad.
59256,And it will be ok to be happy again when you get there.
59257,I’m so sorry.
59258,You’re doing what you need to do though.
59259,Time will help.
59260,Hold her.
59261,Cry.
59262,Feel the feelings.
59263,"Oh my child, you are already doing it."
59264,Stay with her.
59265,Hold her.
59266,Grieve together.
59267,Love together.
59268,I am so so sorry about your loss.
59269,"Oh sweet beans, I wish I could hold you both."
59270,"All you can do at the moment is to be with each other, hug each other, listen to each other."
59271,Don´t forget to eat.
59272,"Grief has several stages, this is the first one."
59273,"Keep each other company, it is enough at this stage."
59274,"Dont worry about the grief counseler, itś ok to meet later."
59275,"You have a Journey with many steps before you, a grief counseler is excellent."
59276,"But right now cry, speak, hug, eat."
59277,"And don´t forget yourself, you have grief to."
59278,"Im so sorry for you, if you have been closer to me I would have come with food, so you doesn´t have to think about that."
59279,I hope you have some close to you who can do this.
59280,"All my best wishes ( Im not an english speaker so I don´t now how to really express myself better than best wishes)

I read what another in this thread said about religious idiot."
59281,I agree completely.
59282,"I am a Christian, been in a church all my life."
59283,Don´t belive any shit about Gods plan to have a misscarriage.
59284,If you are Christian only remember that Jesus know what pain and sorrow is.
59285,I hope it help to hear this from a christian.
59286,"Hugs to both of you, I'm so deeply sorry for your loss."
59287,"As someone who has felt that loss, comfort and be there for her, gently remind her that this was not her fault or yours."
59288,"She will blame herself, she was already picturing holding them in her arms, and imagining their laugh and smile."
59289,She feels gutted in a different way in the way that physically she will feel devoid.
59290,"She may pull away physically  due to this for awhile, and thats okay, she just went through severe trauma and needs her heart to heal before she may feel comfortable again."
59291,Its important to remember she could feel the changes in her body and might have felt that flicker of connection that there is a life growing in me.. and now that is gone.... you will probably see her resting her hand on her stomach subconsciously only to break down when the stark realization hits.
59292,If you knew you're potential due date prepare to have that date hit hard...grieving is a long process so be patient and kind to her and yourself.
59293,Just be there for each other.
59294,I’m so sorry for your loss.
59295,Just be there for her and don’t be afraid to show that you are mourning too.
59296,"Time helps, hang in there."
59297,I'm so very  sorry for your loss.
59298,It's a lot to grieve and process.
59299,There is no rush.
59300,Some people find it helps to  name the baby.
59301,It may seem like it feels  worse because you had already told family and friends.
59302,"However, there are many people who find they are left grieving somewhat  alone because their family and friends didn't go through the up with them and have a harder time going  through the down with them."
59303,"It's likely  impossible to know in hindsight which would have been easier for you, sharing or not sharing."
59304,When my friend miscarried we were both  thankful we  had gotten to celebrate and could mourn together.
59305,Lots of lovely comments here.
59306,Some of our   comments here aren't the most sensitive so just ignore anything  that don't bring consolation and try not to let them add to your grief.
59307,"Hi hon,
There are no words for the grief you both are going to go through."
59308,You’re doing the most right now by being there.
59309,Immense hug to you both.
59310,"What’s the name of your baby, if you don’t mind me asking?"
59311,You’re welcome to vent in my inbox.
59312,Please don’t feel like this is taboo.
59313,"I’ve been through it, many other parents have been through it."
59314,Don’t keep it in.
59315,"Oh, noo."
59316,I'm so glad you're going to counseling.
59317,"And you sound like a lovely, protective partner."
59318,I hope you take extra good care of yourself.
59319,"I'm sorry, love."
59320,You are doing a very good job of being her support.
59321,Take care of each other.
59322,You’re both doing the best you can at the moment.
59323,"Try to have water and something to eat, just something to keep you safe."
59324,"Your wife has been through a lot of stress physically, she especially needs to stay hydrated, fed and well rested."
59325,A little bit is better than nothing at all.
59326,There’s not much that can be said to take away the pain or make this easier.
59327,"Continue to be with her, let her know she’s not alone."
59328,Don’t forget to take care of yourself as well.
59329,"If you need to cry, let it out."
59330,It sounds like you two have a wonderful support system with friends and family.
59331,If possible lean on them for support and comfort.
59332,Your hospital or OBGYN may have resources for long term counseling and support groups in your area.
59333,A friend recently lost a child and there was an online support group for mothers who’ve lost children.
59334,The group teaches parents coping skills and provides support from a person who’s been through it.
59335,If you feel ready you can become a mentor to another parent  and help them through.
59336,I can try and find the program name if you’d like.
59337,There’s no right way to feel or grieve.
59338,"There will be  good days and bad days, stick by each other throughout."
59339,Sending you both lots of love.
59340,❤️
59341,See if she wants to go somewhere to scream with you.
59342,I lost my three year old niece suddenly and tragically.
59343,"You will learn that the muscles in your forehead can become sore from crying so hard, for so long."
59344,"I was a shell of myself, and everyone was so shattered and kind to me, except my best friend who yelled NO!!"
59345,WHAT THE FUCK???
59346,It felt so good to have someone be furious.
59347,We went on a drive and screamed into the night.
59348,It doesn’t change anything but what’s happened to you both is very unfair.
59349,Sometimes it feels good to just scream it out.
59350,"My heart feels heavy for you both; grieve in whatever way makes sense and as many others have said, just be there for each other."
59351,💛
59352,I'm so sorry for your loss.
59353,"Sometimes the best thing you can do for someone in grieving is listen and ask what they need at the moment 

Signed a younger sister"
59354,Just here to send my hugs for you both and let you know you’re doing the best you can.
59355,I’m sorry.
59356,Just give her love like you are.
59357,Grief counseling is great.
59358,You're already doing the most important stuff - you're emotionally and physically present.
59359,"You're holding her, telling her she's loved, and sharing her grief."
59360,Keep on doing that.
59361,"If she wants to talk, be a patient and attentive listener."
59362,"If she asks you to share you feelings, let her know you're deeply mourning the loss of your child."
59363,Gently encourage her to eat & drink.
59364,Offer to order in/make her favorite comfort foods.
59365,Make sure to bring her tissues and a glass of water after she's cried.
59366,"She'll most likely not be interested in eating, so don't push too hard."
59367,Just let her know you're there to take care of her.
59368,See to her physical comfort as you can - ask if you can make her more comfortable by fluffing pillows/getting blankets/making sure all the bedding is fresh & clean/getting her into her favorite jammies.
59369,"I've been stuck-in-bed grief stricken, and it was a huge comfort to have someone brush my hair, tuck me into a freshly made bed, and put warm socks on me."
59370,"I'm so sorry for your loss, sweetheart."
59371,Sending hugs to you both.
59372,"Make sure you're eating & staying hydrated yourself, and if you need help, reach out to your friends and family."
59373,You’re doing everything you should be doing for her and you’re doing it right.
59374,Just don’t forget about yourself.
59375,"You may have not gone through the physical aspects of the pregnancy and the miscarriage, but the loss is also yours."
59376,Don’t ignore your feelings
59377,"This account has a lot of content that really helped our family through the time of baby loss, hopefully it’s able to help bring you some peace as well (@alexmammadyarov ) on Instagram."
59378,She’s a psychotherapist and excellent writer/ creator
59379,"sis here, so sorry for your loss."
59380,"it’s wonderful that you’re trying your best to be so supportive and attuned to your wife’s emotional state and health, but i just want to say that your emotions and grief matters too <3 

sending many warm internet hugs!"
59381,Same thing happened to me and my wife on Friday as well.
59382,"Very early stages, thought she was 11 weeks pregnant, turns out it had ceased to be viable at 7."
59383,She’s spent the last three days passing the remains and having terrible cramps.
59384,"I’m just trying to help in any way, holding her when she cries and making hot water bottles mostly."
59385,I’m just very tired.
59386,"I'm so, so, so sorry."
59387,It's a pain I am intimately familiar with.
59388,Your wife's hormones will be all over the place.
59389,And probably for quite a little while.
59390,Be good to each other.
59391,Do not feel the need to explain yourselves to  others.
59392,And remember to take care of yourself too.
59393,The other mum's and I are always here.
59394,I'm thinking of you both and wish I could give you both a big hug xxx
59395,"I’m sorry this happened, you can find some lovely people and great support in r/Miscarriage"
59396,I'm so sorry about your loss sweetheart.
59397,"If you need it, BetterHelp.com can have you set up with a therapist within 48 hrs."
59398,"You can find someone who specialises in grief counselling (and set other preferences if you want) and do video, phone or text sessions, so you don't even have to get out of bed of you don't want to."
59399,"I truly can't begin to imagine what you're going through, but I'm sending my love ❤"
59400,You are doing everything you can to support her.
59401,Allow yourself to grieve too.
59402,"Even though this wasn't a planned pregnancy it was very much wanted and you are both very upset by its loss, you will always remember the little pea."
59403,The grief does lessen as time goes on with support.
59404,"I send my love out to y'all, just hold her close and take it day by day."
59405,Try to drink water and light snacks if you can force yourself and be there for each other.
59406,You're each others rocks right now
59407,My heart is crying for you three.
59408,"Have been through this, please keep talking."
59409,"Please don’t shut down, even if you really want to."
59410,Tears for you both...and lots of love.
59411,"Oh sweetie, this is devastating news."
59412,You're doing what needs to be done.
59413,Hold her and be there for her.
59414,"One bit of advice I might give as someone who has been through the same, is that - if you can, and I know it will be hard - be the one that tells the family and friends the news."
59415,"If it's at all possible, dont leave it up to her."
59416,Perhaps even a close friend could be asked to pass that news along so you also dont have to.
59417,It will help make these trying days a little easier for her.
59418,"There is no greater pain than loosing a child, I am so very sorry for your loss."
59419,You are doing exactly the right thing.
59420,My husband and I has a miscarriage  the first time we got pregnant.
59421,What helped me is that we gave our baby a name (we picked a gender neutral name as it was too early to determine).
59422,We donated to children's charities in our baby's memory we do that once a year.
59423,We also planted a memorial garden in our yard for closure.
59424,It's helped so much to have somewhere to visit.
59425,"I wish you and your wife healing and peace, deepest condolences."
59426,You’re already doing it kiddo.
59427,"Hold her, love her, walk through this terrible moment together."
59428,Make her favorite comfort food and be patient as she eats a bite an hour….. just keep warming it up and setting it in front of her.
59429,"Everyone grieves differently and we all need patience, but losing a pregnancy is so hard because it’s not just the grief, it’s the hormones, the physical loss."
59430,Be there for her.
59431,But remember - YOU MUST ALSO take care of yourself.
59432,Eat.
59433,Shower.
59434,Drink water.
59435,"Just like flight attendants tell you, you have to put your own oxygen mask on first."
59436,"It makes you stronger for others, and for her."
59437,Take care kiddo.
59438,Big hugs.
59439,Keep holding her.
59440,Keep being there together through this.
59441,"This shit SUCKS, there's nothing to make it just be better unfortunately."
59442,"Time,  and grieving is the way to process this."
59443,Great call on already contacting a grief counselor!
59444,For now just be there for her and don't forget about you.
59445,You lost the baby too.
59446,"Sometimes she'll need to vent, sometimes she'll need to be distracted sometimes she'll need to throw things at the wall(hopefully soft stuff)."
59447,But you can be there by making it safe for her to do all of this.
59448,Don't try to 'fix it' or 'spin it' in a positive light.
59449,"Yes you *were* child free, but now you were happily expecting."
59450,Reminding her of this will NOT help.
59451,"Hold her and listen to her.Get her cold wash clothes for her forehead some times.some kind of special lotion to use on her hose and face.. but her nose will become [chapped.talk](https://chapped.talk) love talk, but not fuck talk."
59452,They are not the same.
59453,"Order in her favorite food, unless you're a talented chef."
59454,Then I expect you know what to cook.
59455,This would be a good time to provide small chocolates.
59456,"Not an 8 oz hershy bar, something in pampering small bites."
59457,mrs sees is my favorite.
59458,The main thing is pampering her and letting her know how much you love her.
59459,Now I understand the purpose of this subreddit
59460,To my darlings.
59461,You are experiencing an unimaginable pain.
59462,Both of you.
59463,"You are doing right by your wife, but you must also help yourself too."
59464,Perhaps helping her is your help?
59465,Just do what makes sense right now & step away from ‘everyday’ life for now.
59466,"Not because you’re giving up, but because sometimes it’s essential for both your mental health."
59467,"I’ve seen it posted in another comment, but any ‘gods plan’ comments, just let them roll off you as those comments mostly come from an ignorant place (ignorant as in, not knowing any better, rather than malicious)."
59468,"I’ve been through it, twice & those words ‘no heartbeat’ cut to the core of your soul, so I get it."
59469,"When you’re both strong enough, conduct a little ritual, even simply lighting a wee candle for an hour on any significant date you choose, acknowledge any ‘firsts’ that come up too can help e.g."
59470,"Christmases etc as that will mean you’re not suppressing emotions, it’s ok & totally rational to grieve the ‘what could have been’ as well as the ‘what has been’ (if that makes sense?)."
59471,"In time, the light will get brighter again, trust me."
59472,I have walked your wife’s path & did it alone the first time and you have no idea how much your actions will help each other.
59473,Much love & strength to you both x
59474,You are doing it.
59475,Just keep reminding her that its not her fault (because she will always wonder if she did something that could have caused it) and hold her tight.
59476,"Calling a grief counselor was a thoughtful thing to do, too, as the emotions can be overwhelming."
59477,You being there and grieving with her is the best thing you could ever do.
59478,Im so sorry for your loss.
59479,"The pain of losing a child is deep and, at times, unbearable, but having a partner who truly cares and who is actively supportive is the best healing balm for such a broken heart"
59480,Just be there for each other.
59481,Find some professional help (therapist) if you guys really continue to have a hard time with it.
59482,You will always think about it but if you find it is starting to control your thoughts finding someone to talk to for both of you sooner that later is your best bet.
59483,Sorry for your lose.
59484,I'm sorry for your loss.
59485,💜
59486,You keep holding her.
59487,And you keep telling her how much you love her.
59488,"Cry with her, don't suppress your emotions."
59489,"Yes, she is the one experiencing the added physical trauma of losing a baby that far into her pregnancy, but both of you are experiencing the emotional trauma of losing a baby."
59490,So cry with her too.
59491,And hold her.
59492,"And let her know that you do not blame her, that none of this was her fault."
59493,Make sure that you have additional support that you can go to for comfort as well.
59494,"Keep an eye out on your wife's physical symptoms (excessive bleeding, high blood pressure, blurry vision with a headache...) and take her back to the hospital if anything physically concerning is happening."
59495,"You should be able to call her OBGYNs office at any time (day, night, weekend, holiday) and get connected with the doctor on call."
59496,They should be able to give medical advice over the phone if the hospital or Dr office do not have an advice nurse.
59497,DRINK WATER!!!
59498,"I know you don't have an appetite, and neither does she."
59499,"That's ok, but you both need to make sure you are staying hydrated."
59500,Soup would be a good way to help stay hydrated and also get some sustenance.
59501,Ask close family or friends or neighbors to bring some easy premade dishes.
59502,My husband's disabled sister passed away earlier this month and we stayed with his family while she was in hospice and a while after her passing.
59503,Neighbors brought over meals right out of their oven ready to eat.
59504,It made everything just a bit easier to not have to worry about trying to think of making dinner or something like that.
59505,All we needed to do was reheat it and eat it and that made it much easier on us.
59506,I am so sorry this has happened to you both.
59507,Keep hugging her as much as she can stand.
59508,It'll help you both.
59509,I just had a few tears for you too.
59510,I'm real sorry.
59511,"When she’s ready to venture outside, look for signs."
59512,"A ladybug landing on her, a butterfly, a cardinal."
59513,Whatever.
59514,Then whenever something like that happens think of your baby and know he/she is near.
59515,"It’s silly, but definitely a small comfort."
59516,Also don’t decide for her when the grieving period should be over.
59517,Let her feel how she feels in her own time frame.
59518,It will be especially difficult around the time your child would have been born.
59519,Sending both of you love.
59520,It sounds like you're both taking all the right steps.
59521,Keep supporting each other emotionally and do get counseling.
59522,You're both going to be delicate for a while so just feel your feelings.
59523,"She does have the extra burden of the physical trauma of the loss, so be understanding as she'll probably take longer to get back to functional."
59524,There is no set timeline for grief or healing.
59525,I also imagine that early ambivalence about the pregnancy may be fueling some of the emotional distress.
59526,"Those feelings, along with subsequent acceptance and excitement are totally valid."
59527,Emotions are messy.
59528,Coming to grips with a future you'd never planned for and having it taken away is cruel beyond words.
59529,Love each other and do the best you can.
59530,<<HUGS>>
59531,"You're doing all you can, just be there for her."
59532,My partner and I lost our first baby and it is still devastating 3 years later.
59533,"Grief counseling will do a lot to help, it did for me, until then, just keep doing what you're doing and don't forget to go to grief counseling for yourself too."
59534,I’m so sorry for your loss.
59535,Just be there for each other.
59536,"And take care of yourself as well… You also experienced a loss, and I think sometimes the fathers get forgotten in this sort of thing."
59537,"Just be together, And know that a child free old lady somewhere is thinking of you both."
59538,I’m so sorry.
59539,I’ve been through a pregnancy loss myself.
59540,It never goes away but time makes it easier to bear.
59541,Thanks for being there for your wife and make sure you care for yourself as well.
59542,"Many hugs to you and your wife, sweetie."
59543,♥️♥️♥️
59544,When I was going through a different grief looking back alot of the trauma is blocked but what I do remember is his comfort and going through it with me.
59545,"He would crawl in behind me running his fingers through my hair and I play with my ears as a soothing thing and so he did that, ran his fingers over my back.. held me as I cried."
59546,he turned to every soothing action he knew.
59547,So you just need to be with her.. and know that you are grieving too.. so be gentle with yourself as well.
59548,"Order take out as others said, I think if you have the money you should do a couple small Amazon purchases for soothing.. like a big heated blanket that you two can curl up under.. something that smells comforting.. something that meets the essentials.. there's stick on trash bags that you can stick to the side of the bed and that way stuff is being thrown out when neither of you have the energy to function.. dry shampoo if she's not able to shower.. shower stuff if she finds the shower soothing.. if you're worried about what you both are getting nutrient wise look at something similar to evolve.. it's a supplement that's supposed to give you anything you might be lacking..."
59549,"If you're worried that she won't eat take out you can do protein shakes, ghost has some really yummy ones.."
59550,I'm a person when dealing with stress or grief I struggle to eat at times so having that helped me.
59551,The grief counselor was a great move on your part even if they have to come later.
59552,I'm so sorry for your loss.. for the pain.. and I am so proud of you for taking care of you two.. you love her and that'll help carry you guys through.
59553,This part is something for the future not anytime soon and is very dependent on how you guys feel down the road.. but there are tons of grief products... there's a woman who makes a weighted baby based off of the child you lost.. for some mom's it was being able to hold the baby they either never got to hold or lost.. there's teddybears with the heartbeat..there's another woman who makes replicas of where they were at with molds so even the earliest loss.. and there's others who use ashes or ultrasounds.. there are people out there that can work with anything you have or don't have in a variety of ways.
59554,"This is not helpful for every person, for some it's too painful and for some it's a tribute and sometimes a way to process the grief."
59555,I just wanted you to know that there is grief work out there if you decide that's something for your personal loss.
59556,"Lastly, again later down the road.. something that helped us process the trauma was a rage room."
59557,Often they have packages and if you still have more to let out you can purchase individual items to break like a washer.
59558,"I know there is nothing that will take the pain away, and I'm so deeply sorry."
59559,"It's a heartbreak that even words can't touch.. so I'm sending my love for you both as you weather this storm together, you're doing great as you are, none of my suggestions are necessary just being there is the only thing that truly matters💓"
59560,"I'm sorry, I can't even imagine."
59561,Sending you both so much love right now.
59562,Remember so long as you're not hurting people or animals there's no wrong way to grieve.
59563,Do what your heart needs.
59564,Hey sib!
59565,Run to store / order delivery and grab some liquid IV/ Gatorade or Pedialyte.
59566,Grab some chapstick ( put this on lips and nose) and the expensive tissues.
59567,Grab whatever comfort food is for you two.
59568,Grab one or two magazines for distraction when she's ready.
59569,Put on her favorite show for noise in the background.- quietly .
59570,Name your baby.
59571,Hold one another and talk.
59572,There is no right or wrong here.
59573,There's a loss of what could have been and what you hoped for.
59574,Grief is not set stages and no two people grieve the same.
59575,All you can do is be there for one another.
59576,"Something you will find:
Loss and grief comes in waves."
59577,"It drowns you in the beginning and you struggle to find air, to find the world, the waves drag you under and the riptide rips your soul out of you."
59578,"With time, you learn how to fight and come up for air, then how to swim and head toward shore and back to a new sense of normal with the waves still lapping around you."
59579,Sometimes chocking you when you least expect it.
59580,"And finally, you make it to shore and you stand and you see the world right side up ..."
59581,But the waves are still there lapping at your feet.
59582,"Even when you leave the beach, you still see the shoreline....
That's grief."
59583,All you can do is make sure you fight to come up for air and keep fighting and swimming to shore.
59584,"Some wise words a friend gave me- tough times don't last, tough people do."
59585,This is one of those.
59586,"All you can do is breathe and know that time doesn't heal all wounds, but it helps it to close."
59587,Be sad.
59588,Cry with her.
59589,Be upset however you need.
59590,"A grief counselor is good, but remember it won't take this pain away, just give you means to cope with these big emotions."
59591,You have this.
59592,"It may not feel like it right now, but you do."
59593,Sending light and love.
59594,I am so sorry to hear of this.
59595,Hugs.
59596,Hugs.
59597,And more hugs for you and her.
59598,As a man who had a similar story take time off work.
59599,Be together.
59600,Hug talk and grieve.
59601,Don’t forget to feel yourself.
59602,Be there for her.
59603,If I can drive to hug you I would.
59604,It’s difficult.
59605,But you have my teary eye thoughts and love.
59606,I pray for you both.
59607,❤️
59608,I’m so sorry.
59609,Sit with her.
59610,Be in the grief with her.
59611,Don’t look away from the pain.
59612,I think you’re doing all of the right things.
59613,"When I had a miscarriage, it was physically painful, too."
59614,"Depending on how far along she is, it feels like somewhere between a bad period and actually giving birth."
59615,"So be sure to get her pads, medicine, warming pads for her cramps, ice, etc."
59616,"I’d also find some really soft, comforting items like super comfortable sweat pants, blankets, and things like that."
59617,"Last, I would suggest moving the baby things out of her sight- maybe to a closet or something like that."
59618,The last thing she needs is a reminder that they won’t be used.
59619,"Hang in there and remember, your feelings are valid and important too."
59620,You lost a baby too.
59621,First off I'm sorry for your loss and I know it well.
59622,I agree with the others that you are doing it right.
59623,"Sit and hold her, cry and feel the loss, be there for her."
59624,"The hurt will always be there, but it eases in time."
59625,"Seek a grief counselor, make sure you and her eat."
59626,I saw you were worried about her parents god stuff so maybe take a day or two (more if needed) to yourselves and close friends.
59627,Love you and take care
59628,So sorry son.
59629,It will happen when it's supposed to but that doesn't help grief.
59630,Remind her this is something you get thru together.
59631,It does help hearing your not alone.
59632,I'm so sorry for your loss.
59633,I think the most important thing is to be there for her.
59634, Not much else you can do unfortunately just be there for her and encourage her (when she’s ready) to reach out to friends or a therapist.
59635,My wife and I were in exactly the same position two years ago and we still struggle with the grief but when she told friends/family about what had happened some would confide in her about similar experiences and were able to bond and talk about it.
59636,It’s such a shame that so many women go through that and have to go right back to work as if nothing had happened and sometimes just knowing someone close to you has been in a similar situation and talking about it can really help.
59637,So sorry for your loss.
59638,We commonly get asked when we’re having kids and I find it such an offensive question because a lot of people don’t know what we’ve been through and how it has affected us.
59639,u/yeast510 you've made a great start by just being there.
59640,You don't have to do much more than that.
59641,I've been there.
59642,Just keep showing up for her.
59643,Keep reminding her you love her.
59644,Keep holding her.
59645,Don't try to rush her recovery.
59646,Validate her feelings.
59647,Ask a family member to manage telling everyone you already have.
59648,I'm sorry.
59649,It doesn't really go away but it does stop hurting.
59650,"Oh bubs, I am so sorry for your heartbreak; your love for her is beautiful."
59651,Hug each other tight in this time of mourning.
59652,I wish warmth and peace.
59653,"If someone in your life hasn't already stepped up, ask a trusted friend or family member to help with any phone calls to workplaces to organize time off for both of you, and to help with calls from doctors or the hospital if they call to set up follow-up appointments or the dreaded ""how was your experience"" survey (though i really REALLY hope they read charts before they do those calls)."
59654,"I work in healthcare in the US and sometimes hospitals get so antsy about needing to ""close the loop"" with a patient that people get bombarded with phone calls and voicemails...you truly do not need that right now."
59655,Love you and thinking of both of you.
59656,You are already doing an amazing job.
59657,Keep it up.
59658,There is a book called It’s OK That You’re Not OK by Megan Devine.
59659,She also hosts a podcast called Here After.
59660,"There are lots of podcasts about grief, but that one (and her book) have by far helped me the most."
59661,"No silver linings or religious messages, just truth and real people’s stories and processes of grief."
59662,It’s messy and complicated and not at all linear.
59663,A therapist will be able to help you both.
59664,My heart goes out to you.
59665,I’m proud of you for reaching out.
59666,You’re doing a great job.
59667,You’re not alone.
59668,"I applaud you for asking questions (of yourself, the universe, her, etc)."
59669,It really helps me when I process verbally (out loud).
59670,"Oh honey, just rest and hold her."
59671,You're hurting because this hurts.
59672,It will always hurt but not always this bad.
59673,Just be there for each other.
59674,"Love you, mom."
59675,I'm so sorry for your loss.
59676,I can't help but tear up for you.
59677,"Grief is so personal, and sometimes so unpredictable."
59678,"There's times you'll be wiped out: hold each other, or weep or scream as needed."
59679,"There's times the grief isn't as on the surface: that's ok, as well."
59680,"You are doing what is needed, and that's all you should do, cry, hold each other, rest, sleep."
59681,"Be careful to not get dehydrated, and remember: Sorrow can and maybe should be shared, as you feel the need."
59682,My darlings have hope.
59683,"At the risk of making this about me, perhaps this will help."
59684,I truly know what you are going through.
59685,May I share with you a story I’ve never told you?
59686,"As you know I waited almost too late to have children, but finally conceived!"
59687,"Everything was going fine, we had passed the three month first trimester with no problems."
59688,"So, we thought it was time to share our good news with friends and family."
59689,We prepared a nursery etc.
59690,and settled in.
59691,Well as you have surmised it was not to be.
59692,I miscarried at 5 months and had to have a hospital procedure to make sure I didn’t have complications etc.
59693,I was devastated as you are now my loves.
59694,Months went by and I was disconsolate.
59695,And then one day I decided to go ahead and test.
59696,I was pregnant again.
59697,And this time all went smooth sailing.
59698,And that my sweet child is how you were born.
59699,I don’t know if this will help.
59700,Just know I am thinking of you everyday and love you both very much.
59701,"Oh Darling, I’m so sorry that you both have to suffer through this."
59702,I wish I could be there to hold you both and tell you that you will be ok.
59703,"It may not seem like it right now, but you will be ok. 

Can you afford for you both to take a day or two off of work?"
59704,"If you can, I highly recommend this."
59705,You need each other right now.
59706,Work can wait.
59707,"Man, this brought me tears."
59708,I have a very similar experience except I am the woman and it was an ectopic.
59709,We just laid in bed for hours and had no idea what to do.
59710,A list of things my bf does when I become very depressed because maybe it will help.
59711,"Reminds of helps me to eat
Reminds me to go to the bathroom (seriously It sounds silly but when you can't get out of bed you end up holding it and it's really not good for your kidneys, which she may be at higher risk rn)
Bringing me individual flossers when I can't brush my teeth same with wipes when I can't shower
And reminding me to drink water."
59712,We also communicate a lot so I know how his mental health is doing because it can be a lot talking care of someone.
59713,You just lost a baby too so remember to take care of yourself too 💕
59714,You are doing everything right.
59715,Give it a little time.
59716,The grief counselor will help.
59717,"Maybe tonight or tomorrow order her favorite take out, or make her favorite meal, don't forget you get to grieve too and more than that you get to grieve together."
59718,You have both suffered a loss.
59719,Whatever it is that you both mutually find comfort in...if it's cuddling and watching movies or a certain show.
59720,If she has a favorite tea/hot drink or cold drink and favorite hobby.
59721,"Also finding a way, after time has passed, to memorialize your lost little one may help ease the pain of loss....It depends on how you both feel about it."
59722,"Most importantly this was no one's fault...not yours or hers, don't blame yourself and try to keep her from trying to take it all on."
59723,I'm so sorry this has happened to you both.
59724,Hugs are not enough but I hope they help.
59725,"I wish I were there to make you a meal, I hope you have someone to drop you both food and kind words."
59726,Hold eachother tight.
59727,I’m so sorry for you both.
59728,We are trying and lost our first in spring this year.
59729,Same sort of thing.
59730,I had pain and bleeding.
59731,Went in.
59732,No heartbeat.
59733,It’s devastating and difficult.
59734,Give her your love and support.
59735,Just being there for her and supporting her.
59736,It’s your loss too and it’s okay to be vulnerable and upset.
59737,As hard as it is you need to make sure you’re both eating and drinking enough.
59738,Especially her if she has to still go through the removal.
59739,It takes time to get over.
59740,It’s gonna be shitty and hard but just keep putting one foot in front of the other.
59741,It took about 3-4 weeks until I started to feel better but it might be more or less for you guys.
59742,Loosing them still makes me sad sometimes and it’s been starting to bother me more now that what was there due date is close.
59743,Hopefully the grief counselor helps.
59744,You could also look into a general therapist/psychologist or one that is more specialized for pregnancy related issues.
59745,"You are being great, I'm so sorry for ur loss"
59746,I’m so sorry.
59747,My heart is breaking for you.
59748,"It sounds to me like you're doing exactly the right things, Duck."
59749,"Love on her, give her space if she asks."
59750,"Every person and every miscarriage is different, but as long as you communicate, things will settle eventually."
59751,"You don't have to decide to try again, just because you got used to the idea, but it is also okay to decide that the new future you'd got used to looks pretty good and change your plans, once you've both had a chance to heal."
59752,So sorry for your loss.
59753,"I have been there, too.The doctors had given me pain pills and I had anxiety medicine, so for a couple weeks, I stayed on the couch and just stayed heavily medicated."
59754,"During that time, I read every book I could find about coping with pregnancy loss."
59755,I also joined several Facebook groups and talked to others who have been there.
59756,I bought some customized memorial jewelry off of Etsy that brought me some comfort.
59757,"Then to get out of the house we went and bought some furniture, just to get out."
59758,"A few weeks later it was Mother’s Day, so we planted a tree in the baby’s honor."
59759,"It was a horrible time, and I don’t remember much of it because I was drugged up and devastated, but those were some little things that helped a tiny bit."
59760,So sorry you have to experience this.
59761,I’m so sorry for your loss.
59762,"You’re doing what you should be by being a supportive, loving, grieving spouse."
59763,Remember to take care of yourself and allow yourself to grieve too.
59764,"Not a mom, just a big brother sending hugs to both of you."
59765,"Oh sweetie, I am so terribly sorry."
59766,What a heartbreaking loss for you both.
59767,I wish I could hug both of you.
59768,Just be there for her.
59769,Hold her.
59770,Let her grieve.
59771,Understand that sometimes different people grieve differently.
59772,"Don’t tell let other people tell her things like “you can try again” or “well, I’m sure you’ll have another baby.” Because right now she is grieving THIS baby, who is (and will always be) irreplaceable."
59773,And please remember to take care of yourself too.
59774,"Physically the pain is hers but emotionally, you’re both sharing it."
59775,There are a lot of good resources online for parents who have gone through a stillbirth.
59776,Some communities have support groups as well – maybe your doctor or hospital can recommend one.
59777,"This is a good list of websites, podcasts etc."
59778,https://www.umwomenshealth.org/resources/resources-support-pregnancy-loss
59779,"Some no appetite food options:

Chicken noodle soup, or just chicken broth."
59780,"Pudding, I like the kind you cook with a piece of toast, but instant or pudding cups are easy."
59781,"Applesauce or canned fruit, chilled is nice
Popsicles
Cereal, add a banana if you like them
Lunch meat, I eat it straight out of the package when nothing else is palatable."
59782,"Toast
Hot cocoa or tea, something warm to wrap your hands around, and feel the hug that is hidden in each cup."
59783,"Smoothies
Milk shake 


Basically make eating as easy as possible."
59784,"Things that require zero prep and mostly no chewing (which is super hard when you don't want to eat anything)


This is very hard, but you will make it through."
59785,You are doing everything right.
59786,Just be present and grieve for your baby.
59787,Just hold her.
59788,"Run a hot bath for the both of you, wash her, be there for her."
59789,"Lots of fluids and hydration … A hot cup of tea, raspberry leaf if you can, honey… take as long as you need to grieve."
59790,Don’t forget there are hormones at work here too … & my condolences.
59791,"Oh gosh I’m so sorry :-( try putting on some soft relaxing music on YouTube, it can help relax both of your nervous systems in your bodies, which get strained during periods of stress and grief."
59792,Plenty of self care is a must.
59793,Warm bubble baths with gentle music playing in the background.
59794,Put your favourite show or movie on tv.
59795,Body massages can help relieve the tension and strain caught in both of your nervous system too.
59796,"Once you both are able to go out, visit a local park/nature reserve/forest, it can help to ground your thoughts/emotions."
59797,"Observe what’s around you; the sound of the wind rustling the leaves on the trees, the trickle of water along a stream, the colours, the scents, the sound of the birds."
59798,"Just be in that moment and if any tears come just let them flow - it’s good to cry, it allows your body to let go of physical stress."
59799,This.
59800,Be there hold her.
59801,Be there together with each other.
59802,Order take out.
59803,Thank you
59804,Take away any obligation from her if you can.
59805,That's what my husband did for me when we had to terminate our long waited pregnancy.
59806,The only thing I had to do was go to the hospital for follow up.
59807,"Let her grief as long as she needs, the way she needs."
59808,Be there for her.
59809,"Grief too if you need to, but it's OK if you don't."
59810,The loss of our pregnancy hit my husband 3 or 4 months later.
59811,"Everybody is different

I'm very sorry for your loss, I know it's hard."
59812,Big bear hugs
59813,A former friend of mine lost her baby at 19 weeks.
59814,"I had no idea how to help, so I just listened and hung out with her while she coped with the terrible loss."
59815,I helped her pick roses for the memorial path she laid out in her backyard the next summer.
59816,"I felt awful not knowing what to do, especially when I had to tell her a few months later I was expecting my youngest."
59817,"I'm worried about the ""god's plan"" nonsense from her parents but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it"
59818,This.
59819,😞 ….
59820,Fuckin THIS.🥺🥺🥺 This is so accurate.
59821,Coming from not the same situation but as a mom who lost her child as well.
59822,This.
59823,Dammit.
59824,"This is so perfect and yet another reason why I love my village, but how especially my BF."
59825,He did this exactly.
59826,I could tell you what he did but that’s a story in itself.
59827,But through all of the grieving process he’s been my rock.
59828,Our rock.
59829,And that is all she’ll need.
59830,EVERYTHING.
59831,"You’ll need to make sure you find time to take care you yourself, time to have an outlet."
59832,Set that one boundary like a night a week out or gaming or whatever you do.
59833,(But maybe try to be flexible.)
59834,"Those day’s will lessen and lessen and eventually it turns into just moments, and heads up they’ll start big, but often the big ones come out of nowhere."
59835,(For example in my situation the hospital kept sending mail for milestones like his birthday or death day (it’s what we call it.
59836,We don’t know what else to call if….I’m sorry if that’s crude….
59837,So those would always ruin our moments.. but one you get to a place where you can smile looking at your lives together and feel stronger because you’ve been through it together….
59838,"You’ve got a village once you’ve found each other I guess even if you don’t have other people in that village, get people, look into therapy that you can get, hospitals are great resources for grief therapy, and grief groups….. and that’s what you need!!!"
59839,And it sounds like @yooperann has been through this… because what they said is exactly right….
59840,And I’m so sorry for your loss or (losses)as well… 😮‍💨😮‍💨🫶🫶🫶
59841,Plus make food and watch out she takes basic self care measures.
59842,Ask her to eat If she is obviously not eating well.
59843,Ask her to go for a small walk when you feel that's okay to ask.
59844,Small things that will make life go on eventually.
59845,[removed]
59846,Oh thank you so much for this.
59847,This will be useful as the days and weeks progress
59848,Thank you
59849,Thank you.
59850,We're just going to have to take it one day at a time
59851,This is great insight and something I will keep in mind moving forward.
59852,Today was hard to get her to eat anything but I will continue to find the foods/comfort items shell need as we process everything
59853,We loaded up on BooBerries cereal last week so we've got cereal covered.
59854,Drinking enough water has been hard today.
59855,Both of us have tried to keep up with the tears but I think we've both got a bit of a dehydration headache at the moment
59856,Thank you.
59857,"She's finally sleeping, and the dogs are looking after her at the moment."
59858,I'm taking some time to read through the comments and taking it all in.
59859,Thank you for the reply
59860,We basically posted the same response.
59861,❤
59862,"Unfortunately most of her close friends are out of state, and my siblings are ~300 miles away, except for my brother, who has a demanding job and two kids of his own, so our village is a bit sparse at the moment."
59863,My brother and his wife did order us Thai food for dinner which was really amazing and unexpected.
59864,Lots of back rubs and tissues today for both of us
59865,Thank you
59866,"OP, This is great advice."
59867,"Things are a little different for the mom for all these reasons listed: hormones, loss of blood, etc."
59868,"And although you’ve been right along with her in this pregnancy and loss journey, there are added elements that are sometimes unique to a woman in this situation."
59869,"There is a sense of wonder that can accompany your changing body as your pregnancy progresses and on the other side, there can be an irrational sense of guilt associated with a miscarriage, for example."
59870,*But* this baby was just as much yours as it was hers.
59871,"Additionally, it can be really terrifying when our spouse is having significant bleeding."
59872,Even if you suspected the miscarriage there could still be an element of fear for your wife’s safety.
59873,"I’d encourage you to hold space for her to grieve this loss, but also know that you need to grieve as well."
59874,"Even if you feel you need to put it on pause for a little bit, please spend time reflecting on this eventually."
59875,"Hopefully, your wife will be able to sometimes hold space for your grief as well and that you will both be able to find a way to grieve together."
59876,"In the mean time, prioritize the basic needs: food, sleep, some simple hygiene."
59877,Take it day by day.
59878,Thank you.
59879,I've gone through so many emotions since we found out what happened in the ER.
59880,"I've been sad, mad, speechless, confused, I even felt a bit of relief and that just brought on more feeling of anger and sadness directed towards myself."
59881,Thank you.
59882,"We definitely aren't anywhere near talking about what we'll do moving forward, but this morning when she called her mother to tell her what happened she kept repeating ""I'm sorry mom"" and that just broke me."
59883,I tell her that it's okay to be sad but she shouldn't blame herself.
59884,I don't want her to beat herself up about this.
59885,Thank you.
59886,Thank you for all of this.
59887,"I know in my head it's all true, but hearing it from others helps it sink in"
59888,Thank you.
59889,Lots of small naps and back rubs today for both of us.
59890,We probably didn't drink enough water but we did try.
59891,Crying really does take a lot of energy
59892,Thank you
59893,Her parents are close by but I think they're really grieving too.
59894,This would have been their only grandchild so I think my wife has taken a lot of responsibility for this happening which I'm just heart broken for her.
59895,"I tell her that it's not her fault, but it's hard for her to shake those intrusive thoughts."
59896,My brother and his wife had food delivered to us today which was amazing.
59897,Especially since they're not that close by and have demanding jobs and two children of their own.
59898,"As the days go by I'll reach out to my buddy, but he's near an hour away."
59899,For now I'm just trying to focus on my wife's emotional health
59900,Thank you.
59901,I'm worried how this will physically affect her for sure.
59902,Her pain tolerance is very low and it just breaks my heart to see her in pain
59903,Thank you
59904,We watched two out of the three Lord of the Rings movies today.
59905,They're easy enough to watch or just have some noise going on in the apartment
59906,Oh you're reply made my heart ache even more....OP should definitely heed your words
59907,Thank you.
59908,I'm kinda numb.
59909,I've gone through so many emotions today but honestly I feel like my deepest emotions have been sadness and anger.
59910,"I'm sad for our loss, but even more sad for how sad she is."
59911,"Seeing her this way just breaks my heart, and I'm angry that this has happened to her."
59912,I just want to take the pain away.
59913,She doesn't deserve this.
59914,She is the sweetest person and should only have good things happen to her.
59915,Thanks
59916,My brother and his wife had food delivered to our apartment which was amazing.
59917,She had some nibbles today and we've tried to drink as much water as possible.
59918,Crying and grieving really takes so much out of you
59919,Thank you for all of this.
59920,Everything is so fresh and it seems like the world has sped up while ours has come to a standstill.
59921,We're just trying to take it one day at a time.
59922,So far our circle has been incredibly helpful and supportive
59923,Thank you for sharing this
59924,"She taking the week off at least, and I am actually off work due to a work injury so that's a blessing in disguise I guess."
59925,Thank you
59926,You are absolutely doing it.
59927,My biggest memory after  the end of my pregnancy was my husband just holding me.
59928,"I look back now and feel sad, but also know that we were together in the loss."
59929,Even though it’s probably the last thing in your mind right now please make sure you guys eat something and stay hydrated.
59930,Your going through a horrendously difficult thing and your both going to need the energy to process what happened.
59931,"I’ve been where you are OP, I’m so sorry for your loss."
59932,"Hey, i am so sorry for your loss!"
59933,Be there for her.
59934,"Make her a warm bath and get clothes and towels ready for her, get her some light foods and snacks (especially if you notice she stops eating), have tissues on the ready because the crying will happen at random times."
59935,"And now, for yourself, make sure you look after yourself as well."
59936,"Eat, sleep, cry if you need to, have a warm bath."
59937,I am deeply sorry for your loss.
59938,Sending you both lots of hugs.
59939,I know how it feels.
59940,I’m proud of you for thinking of and supporting your poor wife during such a hard time.
59941,"I know you are hurting too, so please remember to also take care of you, because you also deserve support and grace."
59942,That's very sweet.
59943,"We live in an apartment so no memorial garden, but I'm sure we will find some way to remember the baby some time down the road"
59944,I also had a friend who lost her baby and we had many phone calls where I would just sit quietly and listen to her cry.
59945,<HUGS>  It's very hard when another person's coping mechanisms are so very different and can be hurtful.
59946,"I’d suggest using a response of “so was the holocaust,” or something similar to that nature."
59947,Anything they’d say after that would be rather irrelevant.
59948,"Or, you could say, “well god’s a spiteful cunt.” And shut them up that way."
59949,I’m sorry for your loss.
59950,I'm so sorry for your loss.
59951,In Hebrew we call a death anniversary a yahrzeit.
59952,I just thought I'd give you a word for it.
59953,I'm so sorry sweetie.
59954,I am holding you in my heart.
59955,"If you have not lost a child, please don't be judgemental about ANY of this, truly."
59956,That's a big no here.
59957,This is easily one of the hardest things any parent will go through.
59958,Some are rational and that can be hard to process for the more emotional partner.
59959,"No one here is ""condoning"" anything, we're trying to be really sincere in helping someone prepare so that they don't take the anger personally, because it's a secondary emotional response that the person may have zero control over, because, again, no one knows how they will react in this situation until you've survived it."
59960,"This comment is just saying you need to give your partner tons of grace and room and whatever they need, especially if you're the ""less obviously emotional"" one."
59961,"Which is really silly, everyone's brain processes trauma differently."
59962,"&nbsp;

Please don't do this here, it's just not helping anyone and makes you look clueless."
59963,"It's also agenda pushing, which is against our rules and will get you banned."
59964,"You're right, no one SHOULD, but no one SHOULD suffer the loss of a child, and yet here we are."
59965,The only thing you can do is be prepared and then heal after the crisis if both people are able to.
59966,"But you cannot dictate or judge what happens within a relationship when this occurs, especially from the outside, on Reddit of all things."
59967,"Try to eat salt as well, you cry it out and without salt your body can't absorb water"
59968,Cold spoons for the swollen eyes!
59969,I’m so so sorry for what you’re going through.
59970,"Great minds, great hearts, my friend ❤️"
59971,Can you set up a meal train?
59972,It basically lets you pick your favorite take out places and people can order your meals.
59973,My supervisor had one when she was going through cancer treatment
59974,Thank you.
59975,We have shared our feelings a bit today but I felt like I needed to be the one to take care of things today.
59976,Her grief and comfort is what I'm focused on now.
59977,My time will come.
59978,And it has come in waves throughout the day.
59979,She has always been to supportive during the anniversaries of my parents passing so it's my turn to be the foundation to begin moving forward
59980,It does.
59981,I'm really glad you have that support.
59982,Treat yourselves...
59983,It's okay to indulge a little.
59984,"But really, protein, iron, general nutrition, and hydration will help you cope."
59985,Best of luck.
59986,I’m glad to hear it.
59987,Please indulge in self care with your wife for the next week at least.
59988,You both need it.
59989,I didn’t even know I was pregnant when I miscarried over 20 years ago.
59990,It still hit me like a sock full of pennies to the temple.
59991,One thing that is really important to know for both you and your wife: it wasn’t your fault.
59992,Losing your baby was not because of something that you did or didn’t do.
59993,This is crucial advice!
59994,"For a month after my first pregnancy loss, all i can remember is me laying in bed crying, sleeping, crying some more, my daughter and partner offering me bites of food and cups of water because i wouldn’t move out of the room unless for baths or toilet and changing."
59995,"To this day, my partner tells me that he thought i’d just gave up on life and one day he wouldn’t be able to wake me up."
59996,"If she is having trouble eating regular food, smoothies are a good alternative for the time being"
59997,I have a garden with lots of space.
59998,"If you’d like, I’ll plant a memory rose or whatever plant you’d like for your baby."
59999,"I’m in the UK so it’s probably a long way away for you, but I can send you pictures."
60000,Lots of love to you both.
60001,You can build a small memorial garden on a windowsill.
60002,"I am so sorry for your loss, OP."
60003,"Project Robbie they do blankets, hats and angel wings that march the size of what the baby would have been."
60004,You could always get a house tree or a plant.
60005,Something that blooms and is bright.
60006,Like maybe even a house lemon tree…
60007,perhaps some potted flowers
60008,That has been a lot of my day.
60009,We've taken turns laying on each other's laps and crying while rubbing each other's backs
60010,"As a Jew, please don’t use the holocaust."
60011,There’s lots of ways of telling someone their behavior is inappropriate without hurting a whole group of people.
60012,"That’s lovely, would you mind sharing how it’s pronounced?"
60013,"I don’t want to say it wrong, thanks so much!"
60014,Does that directly translate to “year time”?
60015,It sounds like a Yiddish language branch and thus similar to German.
60016,I love that 🫶 thank you!
60017,I really love the way that the Jewish community handles loss.
60018,With what I’ve seen with Shiva it’s truly beautiful….
60019,Thank you so much for sharing that with me!
60020,"I can’t wait to bring that into our vocab… we call it my son’s day.. which I don’t really like, but we always do a beach day, it’s what he wanted for a graduation party, he wanted to be surrounded by the people he loved and he always came back to the days we had a the beach, so every year on that day we spend it with each other to lean on."
60021,"The loss of him was something that affected a lot of people, which is sad but beautiful."
60022,I feel like it just speaks to his character.
60023,We all say he was the best of all of us.
60024,😮‍💨😮‍💨🥰🥰
60025,Thank you so much.
60026,It’s been 2 years now and thanks to a fantastic therapist and a phenomenal village I’m doing much better.
60027,"It sounds like OP got some great advice, and just the fact that he asked shows he’s on the right path fingers crossed 🤞"
60028,This is lovely.
60029,I would also like to offer to plant something in memory.
60030,A memory garden around the world.
60031,"❤ Kentucky, USA"
60032,I wish I could give you more than one upvote.
60033,🤗 what a gesture
60034,Wow that's so generous.
60035,My wife loves tulips
60036,You’re an amazing soul!
60037,This is such a beautiful gesture
60038,"Please don’t forget to stay hydrated, both of you."
60039,"Your wife especially, her body needs it."
60040,"Be there for each other, it’s all you can do."
60041,That and throat punch anyone that says the BS about Gods plan.
60042,"Grief isn’t linear, it’s more wibbly wobbly, take it slow."
60043,My heart is with you
60044,I’m so sorry for your loss.
60045,I guess you don’t get it then.
60046,"Yart-zeit

https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/371317/jewish/The-Yahrzeit-Anniversary.htm"
60047,"Yes, that does seem to be the root."
60048,"""Year time"" in this case seems to more like ""anniversary""."
60049,"We say, ""May his memory be a blessing."""
60050,Obviously your son's memory is a blessing for all who knew him.
60051,Hugs.
60052,I’m in The Midwest USA and was already planning to plant some bulbs for spring.
60053,I will plant a daffodil for you.
60054,They are the first bloom of life each spring where I live.
60055,Every spring when I see them pop up I feel such relief and hope.
60056,"If you want to see the daffodil I plant for you, I’m happy to send you pics when they bloom in the spring."
60057,I actually really love the idea of an “around the world” memorial.
60058,I’m so sorry for you and  your wife’s loss.
60059,It’s the perfect time of year to plant tulip bulbs!
60060,I’ll get some tomorrow.
60061,Do you have a colour you’d prefer?
60062,Deleted my comment because I decided this wasn’t the place to call out this user for their antisemtism.
60063,"If it's anything like the German Jahrzeit (meaning time of year), which I suppose its related to, then it has a hard Z like the last sound in ants and -eit will sound like eye-t or -ight (like in sight plight might etc) with a pronounced t, so I guess Yartseyet with the stress on the first syllable comes p close."
60064,"Also try not overpronouncing the first r in Yar-, try pronouncing it britishly lol, as in yard"
60065,❤️❤️❤️
60066,This is so amazing.
60067,Through all the grief and loss these little rays of sunshine help so much.
60068,I shared what you and the other commenters have offered to my wife and she thought it was a lovely idea
60069,"I’m in Ontario, Canada and, although it won’t sprout until next spring, I’d be more than happy to plant some memory flowers."
60070,She loves the color violet
60071,[removed]
60072,It's Yiddish I think.
60073,"In Hebrew we say Azkara, which means memorial."
60074,But we will also use Yartzheit.
60075,"OP, if you read this comment, I am so so sorry for your heartbreaking loss."
60076,"I’ll send you a picture of where I’m planting them, and when they come up in the spring."
60077,You just did a very hard thing.
60078,I'm proud of you.
60079,I'm so proud of you.
60080,"He'll probably call again, stay strong."
60081,"There are plenty of fish in the sea who would never even think of acting the way he did, much less have to fight the urge to do so."
60082,"You are so strong, dear one."
60083,You did a good job loving and honoring yourself.
60084,"The next several months will be tough, with wanting to go back and with him reaching out with new guilt trips about his “change.” 

Be kind and gentle to yourself, and know it is a long journey for you to heal the connection drawing you to  the highs and lows with him."
60085,"You can heal, you will feel whole again."
60086,Stand tall and breathe!
60087,>I'm glad that I made that post.
60088,Growing up my parents would fight a lot.
60089,My dad did a lot worse than what my boyfriend did but my mom still stayed with him because she loves him.
60090,That's why I thought that I was overreacting but I know now that I'm not.
60091,"I'm so glad you made that post, too!"
60092,"The fact that you saw this pattern with your parents growing up, had it repeated on you, and then got the help you needed to stand up for yourself so it didn't happen again is HUGE."
60093,"This is called ""breaking the cycle of abuse"" and it is HARD."
60094,Good for you!!
60095,!
60096,"Honey, you did so well."
60097,You should always be free to advocate for yourself.
60098,"I and the other Moms are here in case you need to check your own reactions, but you will be fine."
60099,Very proud of you.
60100,You did a very brave thing.
60101,Be very proud of yourself.
60102,"Now, block him and move on."
60103,He may try to worm himself back into your life but do not let him.
60104,I'm so glad we could be here for you.
60105,Hey.
60106,"It's ok to miss the good parts of a terrible person, as a matter of fact a lot of abusers use love bombing to keep you there."
60107,"ALLOW YOURSELF TO GRIEVE, its still a loss, just one made to better yourself."
60108,I love you.
60109,Way to go!
60110,!...you'll start feeling so much better and happier in the days that come!
60111,"I’m so glad you’re safe, and you have the chance to work on your happiness and building healthy relationships going forward."
60112,You deserve more than you realize.
60113,❤️
60114,So so amazed and grateful for the strength you showed.
60115,"If there is hope for him changing to be better abt his anger towards others in the future, etc."
60116,the way you have handled this—setting clear boundaries that these things are NOT ok— was the way & may’ve been the kindest thing you could have ever done.
60117,It is so worth holding out for someone who makes you feel safe and actually controls their emotions enough to talk through situations in a way that shows they care about you and want to grow together.
60118,"Seriously, bravo and I am so sorry for this pain."
60119,You have saved yourself so much more pain in the long run tho!
60120,I’m so happy to hear this and that you are safe!!
60121,"like someone else said, he might call again."
60122,Stay strong ❤️ and it’s normal to be sad.
60123,I’ve also felt really sad after getting out of a toxic relationship.
60124,"I really missed him, but honestly i also started to feel free."
60125,Now I’m with a really great guy who respects me and my boundaries and who has never yelled at me.
60126,I hope the same for you!
60127,💕💕
60128,I’m proud of you.
60129,Congratulations on holding your ground!
60130,You changed your whole life trajectory.
60131,I’m so glad you’re here
60132,"Stay safe, sis."
60133,You’re on the right track.
60134,So proud of you.
60135,You 100% did the right thing.
60136,"I didn't comment on your last post, as there were already so many good responses, but I've been thinking about you, and I'm glad you are safe."
60137,"Breakups hurt, even when you know it's the right thing to do."
60138,I hope you can take some time to heal and recognise your value.
60139,And I hope you can go into your next relationship with that same strength and find someone who will treat you the way you deserve.
60140,❤
60141,I am so proud of you.
60142,"Sis, I am so PROUD of you!"
60143,It makes sense that you wouldn't necessarily see all the troubling signs because you grew up in a similar dynamic.
60144,Major props for trusting your gut enough to get an unbiased opinion and then sticking to the breakup.
60145,I know it hurts now but you will be so much happier outside of a toxic dynamic.
60146,You deserve to be treated well and happy.
60147,Please don't ever forget that!
60148,I'm proud of you and future you is even more proud!
60149,"You did the right thing, now keep on keeping on!"
60150,You're amazing!
60151,You did the right thing.
60152,"And if you ever doubt yourself, just remind yourself: he punished you for not having sex with him."
60153,You don't deserve to be treated like that.
60154,"I’m so, so incredibly proud of you!!"
60155,It’s truly amazing to witness your strength and resolve.
60156,"You did the right thing, the thing that a lot of people can’t face."
60157,You made the world a better place with your courage and honesty.
60158,You are going places; you’ll barely remember this guy’s name pretty soon.
60159,I think you should expect to feel sad for a little while.
60160,That’s okay; it doesn’t mean you made a mistake.
60161,It just means your emotions are working properly.
60162,"But in about a month and a half, I want you to look at your life and realize how calm and happy you are."
60163,"And I want you to take note of the times when you instinctively think “oh, my boyfriend would be mad about this,” and realize how many of them are there are."
60164,And also realize that you don’t have to worry about it anymore.
60165,"Every time you think about what his reaction might be, I want you to remind yourself, maybe even out loud, “I don’t have to worry about his insane reactions anymore.”"
60166,"I admire your strength and determination--he was hoping crying would win you back, but you stayed firm and calm."
60167,I am so proud of you!
60168,❤
60169,I’m so glad to hear it.
60170,"I went to therapy and one day I was describing something banal and my therapist said, “You’re taking care of yourself the way your parents cared for you.” (ie: the bare minimum)

...

May you have better relationships than the one your parents had with each other, my dear."
60171,It sounds like you’re breaking a cycle of abuse here.
60172,You made the right call and I'm very proud of you.
60173,And you telling him to get help so he treats his next girlfriend better was absolutely perfect.
60174,Well done.
60175,Don't forget you are allowed to be sad.
60176,You are mourning the loss of someone you thought you loved and who you thought loved you; you're sad that it wasn't the relationship you thought it was or wanted it to be.
60177,"Cry, eat ice cream and watch sappy movies."
60178,You earned that.
60179,":)

And when you're done being sad you'll be ready to go out and be the fabulous person you are, and ready to find the next person who will appreciate and love you."
60180, I'm very VERY proud of you.
60181,"You're very special, and deserve to be treated as such.."
60182,I'm so glad you know your worth.
60183,❤️
60184,You did the right thing for you and you did the right thing for him.
60185,Wishing you peace and happiness as you move ahead.
60186,"Sister for a minute here, I’m so proud of you and I want you to know that this is going to be hard but you are so strong and you will be okay."
60187,You did something that I myself was unable to do many years ago and I’m so so proud of you.
60188,And please remember that it’s ok to be sad about doing the right thing ❤️
60189,"Well done, I’m so proud of you."
60190,I would ask you why you may or may not think you deserve better than this type of treatment by another human.
60191,"No judgement, I was in an abusive relationship and it took a while to get out of it."
60192,"But, it wasn’t until my therapist asked me the same question."
60193,Then I began the work of deconstructing my belief system & how I got to where I was.
60194,"You deserve better, you’re worthy of better!"
60195,I’m proud of you and relieved to hear that you’re safe.
60196,Just remember: it’s normal to be sad.
60197,"You got into this relationship for real, honest reasons."
60198,Allow yourself to mourn the end of something that once seemed like it would be your future.
60199,Sending hugs.
60200,"Hey, big sis here."
60201,"Just wanted to let you know I love you, and I'm proud of you."
60202,You’re very brave and strong right now.
60203,You did a good thing for yourself and you will be better of in the future.
60204,Sooo glad!!!
60205,I did not want you to become a statistic and was very afraid you might think he was sorry and would never ever….
60206,Smart cookies stay alive knowing there are good guys out there and he’s not one of them 🤔💜
60207,im so proud of u. sounds like u did an amazing job
60208,"I know you're sad - of course you are, your relationship still ended - but it was the right thing to do."
60209,I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself.
60210,"About the guilt you feel: I saw a post from a therapist once, which said to think of guilt after enforcing a boundary (or ending a relationship) as the soreness you feel after a good workout."
60211,"You've exercised a muscle you don't use very often, but every time you stand up for yourself and enforce boundaries, the ""muscle"" will get stronger and the guilt will be less and less."
60212,"Keep it up, kiddo!"
60213,Oh my gosh!
60214,i’m so proud of you.
60215,just so you know all your feelings are COMPLETELY normal.
60216,"it’s okay to feel guilty, sad, etc."
60217,it’s okay to feel feelings of love.
60218,but i can tell you one thing: your safety and well-being are waaaay more important than his feelings of loss.
60219,he should’ve treated you with respect.
60220,he didn’t.
60221,that was his choice.
60222,♥️ so so proud of you.
60223,best thing to do now would be to block him on all socials as well as his number to stop him from reaching out to you.
60224,"take care of yourself, eat your favorite foods, take a day off work, take a nice bath, walk in nature, or nap all day."
60225,whatever makes you feel good and makes you feel the opposite of guilty.
60226,😗
60227,I have been thinking of you and I am SO glad you chose to prioritize your safety and your heart ❤️.
60228,Good job!
60229,"It's perfectly fine and normal to be sad over the end of a relationship, even when you know for sure that it's the right thing to do."
60230,We often grieve for the what-ifs and could-have-beens when these types of relationships end.
60231,"What if he was kinder, more respectful, less scary and angry?"
60232,But he's not.
60233,"He may change for the better someday, but you are not obligated to be his punching bag along that journey."
60234,He's a grown man.
60235,"He needs to get his life together, and that's his job, not yours."
60236,"&#x200B;

You're gonna be just fine."
60237,You're strong and smart.
60238,Oh my gosh I’m so FREAKIN proud of you!!
60239,"Look at you, breakin cycle of abuse!"
60240,You have helped BOTH of you in doing this.
60241,He knows he can’t treat women like that without consequences and you’ve pointed him in the right direction so it doesn’t happen (to him!)
60242,again.
60243,And YOU should be damn proud of yourself.
60244,You did what your mom could not.
60245,She suffered but you don’t have to.
60246,She normalized it but you see clearly: IT IS NOT NORMAL.
60247,"Everyone gets mad, sure."
60248,But your partner’s instinct should be to keep safe not put you in harms way.
60249,"He put you on harms way, physically and emotionally."
60250,Now you just Matrixes the hell out of those bullets.
60251,Next time someone treats you like that you can just nope the eff right out because now you know what it looks like.
60252,So proud of you for standing up for yourself and every girl in his future!
60253,You have a real strength I didn’t learn until much older.
60254,I am so very proud of you.
60255,I'm so proud of you!
60256,You are strong and brave and resilient.
60257,"I am proud of you, but more importantly I hope you’re proud of yourself."
60258,You did a hard thing because it was right.
60259,You deserve a partner who loves and cherishes you.
60260,"Yelling at you, not taking no for an answer, taking anger out on you, kicking you out of a car - those are not normal behaviors for a good partner and I’m so glad you didn’t accept them."
60261,It’s okay to be sad at this ending but keep in mind that this is really a new beginning for you!
60262,"Just because it was the right thing doesn't mean it was easy, sis."
60263,I'm proud of you.
60264,Proud of you.
60265,<3
60266,I'm proud of you for doing something difficult.
60267,I have learned from experience that it's a good idea to unfollow and even block him on all social media.
60268,"Even if things are friendly between you, the reminders are upsetting and can drag you back in."
60269,Give yourself a break from him for a while.
60270,Big sister here.
60271,I'm fucking proud of you.
60272,"I know from experience that this isn't easy, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to swat him about on your behalf for what he did."
60273,"But you did good, sis."
60274,Keep that head up.
60275,Better days await!
60276,"This is one of the hardest things to do, and your old auntie Abby is so proud of you."
60277,"You are so strong, and you stood up for your safety and your worth."
60278,"By doing this, you have set uncrossable boundaries for yourself that will help you build strong and healthy and loving relationships."
60279,"You are amazing, my fabulous warrior."
60280,"Hey there, sis."
60281,"I was one of the ones who commented - and I want to leave you with a few hopefully helpful and comforting thoughts:

1."
60282,Your feelings are valid.
60283,Your sadness is valid.
60284,"A breakup, even from someone who sucks, is still a breakup - and love doesn't become unreal just because we realize it wasn't given to the right person."
60285,2.
60286,The big AND - a concept from Cognitive Behaviorial Therapy - is your friend now.
60287,He acted like a jerk that night **and** you had moments that lead to you loving him.
60288,He showed a lot of red flags **and** did some things at times that made you happy.
60289,"These don't exclude each other, they do not cancel each other out."
60290,They can absolutely coexist and all the feelings they evoke have their place.
60291,3.
60292,Be proud of yourself!!
60293,The part where they sound sad and lovebomb is the hardest to stay strong for.
60294,"Kind people and loving people prefer to have hope, they don't want to mistreat or misjudge somebody so a genuine-sounding apology can break our hearts."
60295,But remember - an apology does neither undo damage done nor does it mean anything if what follows doesn't set it into stone.
60296,You can forgive him and not want to date him anymore - you can seek distance and not feel responsible for asking the question as well.
60297,It is not your responsibility to fix him or to forgive him.
60298,It is his to be better and never cause this harm again.
60299,"To you, however, he has already done it and what you make of that is yours and yours alone to decide."
60300,His apology can mean something to you and still not lead to the consequences he wants - namely you back in his life and under his coercion.
60301,- It doesn't matter who he will be.
60302,Who he was that night was someone unsafe and you deserve to be safe *always*.
60303,4.
60304,You did nothing more and nothing less than keeping a human being safe.
60305,There is not ever any fault in that.
60306,"Even if ""potential"" goes untapped - you do not owe potential anything."
60307,Nor hope.
60308,Nor doubt.
60309,Certainties outrule them all and the one thing that was certain here is that the car thing happened and that the red flags were all there.
60310,5.
60311,This will hurt for a while and doubt will happen.
60312,It always does.
60313,But that is okay.
60314,"You get to doubt - as long as, at the end of it, you stick to your guns."
60315,You did the right thing.
60316,Trust yourself with this always.
60317,6.
60318,"From where I stand, as an outsider, I'm not too happy to empathize with him but I also know as the person who left, that is a different story - so remember: We are not doing anyone a favour by enabling their toxicity."
60319,Ever.
60320,"If you find yourself wondering if you were ""cruel"" to him, remember that he *has to be better* and getting away with this would never lead to that."
60321,And last but not least: Thank you.
60322,Thank you for not keeping someone around an abuser and making them suffer because of it.
60323,Thank you for saving a living human from so much pain.
60324,You deserved protection and I am glad you provided it for yourself.
60325,Be kind to you these next few weeks.
60326,I wish you the best!
60327,"PS: If you're ever tempted to go back, remember what he did that night in the car."
60328,This is what you get.
60329,"And if he changes for real, he won't try to get you back because he will know it would be entitled as hell to even try."
60330,Good for you!!
60331,Take time to relax and get yourself back to a healthier you.
60332,"Cry if you need to, but don't waste too much time on ex."
60333,I am proud of you!
60334,!
60335,Something I tell my daughter is that no one should ever try to convince you to be in a relationship.
60336,"If you say no, then no it is."
60337,"They don’t have to like it, but not respecting a no means they don’t respect your agency."
60338,"You did the right thing and I’m so, so proud of you."
60339,*hugs*
60340,"I'm so glad to read this update, and incredibly proud of you for valuing yourself enough to cut him loose."
60341,It's was absolutely the right choice!
60342,"Also, I love the power move of you telling him to get help so he can be better to his next girlfriend."
60343,You did an amazing thing.
60344,That first step is the hardest part.
60345,We’re super proud of you.
60346,Stay strong.
60347,You’ve got this.
60348,I'm so proud of you!
60349,I hope you'll read the books that folks recommended in your other post so you can recognize these sorts of things in the future.
60350,Be gentle with yourself while you heal from this.
60351,"Wow, I’m so proud of you, sweetie, that was so brave and you are smart to think things through and very strong to take action."
60352,I’m sorry you didn’t have proper behavior modeled to learn how you should be treated growing up.
60353,My hope is you will find that model of how you should be treated and learn it.
60354,"I hope you realize how valuable you are and only allow people who treat you with love, kindness, and respect into your life."
60355,Hugs!
60356,❤️
60357,You did an incredibly brave thing and we are all very proud of you.
60358,You did right.
60359,It is also ok to be sad and morn the lost of the relationship.
60360,"Morn it, cry, eat Oreos, lament, post here again as many times as you need."
60361,"You deserve better, and you will have better."
60362,The future is bright.
60363,You are amazing!
60364,I'm so so proud of you.
60365,You did the right thing and ultimately will be happier in the end
60366,I am so glad you did what will be best for you in the long run.
60367,"It's ok to grieve that relationship, because you put your time, love and effort into it and you did your best."
60368,"Of course you will miss the good parts, but you'll also be ready soon to find someone who deserves you and treats you well."
60369,Hug.
60370,You're awesome.
60371,\-Auntie
60372,Proud of you!
60373,Wow.
60374,"You deserve good in your life and a HUGE hug, and time to process and heal."
60375,"I admire, and impressed,  with your self reflecting, reading comments, and making a decision that for the end goal is a safe, happy, and comfortable you!"
60376,Big hug & high five from me in Oregon ☺️
60377,>I know that what he did was wrong and he didn't treat me well but I'm still sad about it.
60378,That's okay and normal.
60379,"You have lost something, and you need the space to grieve your loss."
60380,The thing to hold on to is that what you lost can now be replaced with something better.
60381,"Something I didn't figure out until my 30s was that I ended up in an abusive relationship because I thought I had a ""normal"" childhood but didn't."
60382,"Unhealthy habits in our caregivers when we're children lead us to accepting similar unhealthy habits in our adult relationships becausewe consider it ""normal/acceptable""."
60383,Don't fall for this!
60384,Unsolicited advice from (a) Mom: I highly recommend looking at attachment theory and how it affects us in childhood through to adulthood.
60385,Seek out people who have a ( at least mostly) secure attachment style and look for examples of longterm couples who are actually healthy communicators...open and honest and vulnerable.
60386,"Research how to create and defend healthy boundaries and practice, practice, practice!!"
60387,"If you can, get a good therapist that you like and trust, and ask them to help you find good resources too."
60388,"All that aside, I'm so proud of you!"
60389,"So so many people fall for the cycle of abuse, the promises to change, the emotional manipulation of yelling and tears... You didn't!"
60390,You stood strong in your convictions and I know you'll be happier longterm because of it.
60391,"It'd okay to mourn the loss, but keep in mind many times we're not sad because we lost what we had but what we thought we had."
60392,"You thought you had picked a good, living partner, but when you broke up you *actually* lost a manipulative abuser and the **hope** that your partner was the one."
60393,Losing hope is always painful.
60394,"But you're actively doing the work to break that cycle for yourself, any kids you might have, and for those around you..."
60395,I wish I could give you a big hug and let you fall apart on my shoulder.
60396,You did so well!
60397,You deserve a rest before you tackle the world again.
60398,I'm so proud.
60399,❤
60400,"I am so proud of you, whenever I see posts like yours I am so demoralised with how it usually goes that I was disheartened."
60401,This gives me hope that people can still see through the cloud of emotions.
60402,"You did absolutely amazing, we couldn't be prouder of you!!"
60403,It's a very difficult choice to make but you made the right one for your health and future wellbeing.
60404,Stay strong!
60405,You will find someone better in the future.
60406,No reason to settle for his bullshit.
60407,You are strong and you made the right decision.
60408,Good for you.
60409,"You took time, reflected and recognized the red flags, made a preemptive move to break things off."
60410,"It must have been so hard, but thankfully the really hard part is over."
60411,Stay the course and invest this time for yourself.
60412,I am so fucking proud of you
60413,"Honey, I can't put into words how proud I am of you."
60414,"You are so, so strong!"
60415,"I know this was difficult, but you did the right thing."
60416,Just so proud!
60417,"Your sister wrote a poem about a relationship with the line “my mom would not put up with this shit.” The truth is, I learned the hard way, and put up with a lot of shit I shouldn’t have."
60418,"You’ll be fine, dear."
60419,I’m so proud of you.
60420,I am so proud of you!
60421,"That was really difficult, and it’s going to keep being tough for a while."
60422,"You definitely did the right thing, and you come back here any time you need reminded of that."
60423,You deserve better and you already have better by showing yourself the respect he did not.
60424,I have so many things I want to say to you.
60425,"First and foremost, congratulations!"
60426,You made a very difficult decision and followed through on it.
60427,I know this was a VERY hard process for you.
60428,LOVE CAN HURT!
60429,"Reddit can be filled with craziness, lies, all sorts of things However, it can also be a place to obtain rational and informed advice."
60430,You used the powers of reddit perfectly.
60431,"You posed your question, *thoughtfully* read responses, made your OWN decision, then followed through on your decision despite the pleadings of a *very regretful* boyfriend who meant every word he pleadingly told you but would *undoubtedly abuse you again, only more severely."
60432,"*  I am incredibly proud of you and if I had a daughter, I'd be thrilled if she were as thoughtful as you!!!"
60433,You make a sound decision that you will never look back on with regret.
60434,You have carved in stone a life rule.
60435,Noone is allowed to hurt you twice.
60436,YOU are worthy of respect *at all times!
60437,"* Lastly, I want to thank you for taking the time to share your update with us."
60438,Your update motivates people to continue to respond to others seeking advice.
60439,"Even if you had chosen not to follow the advice, updates are an outstanding way to thank people for taking the time to respond to posts."
60440,"Take care, OP-Best wishes for your future."
60441,I am so glad to read this.
60442,You have made my day.
60443,I am so proud of you.
60444,"By the month of May, you won't hurt at all."
60445,You just have to ride out the pain and decide ahead of time the things you can do to take care of yourself to get you through this.
60446,"You said your mom stayed because she loved your dad but, maybe it was because she didn't know how to love herself or didn't have any options or support."
60447,But we are all here for you and you are our girl and we are so proud.
60448,You are like a new person.
60449,"Think about what you *do* want in a man and write it down, like a grocery list."
60450,"Write down the ""dealbreakers"" too, You've got this."
60451,You've always had it in you.
60452,https://youtu.be/b7k0a5hYnSI
60453,You absolutely did the right thing here.
60454,Your safety is far more important than a hot heads bruised feelings.
60455,"Hopefully, he'll take your advice to heart, but even if he doesn't, you can honestly say you tried."
60456,Very proud of you!
60457,"I’m glad you broke up with him, not only for your physically safety, but your mental well-being."
60458,"Despite him being an asshole, you’re still allowed to grieve for the relationship ending."
60459,I’m proud of you and I wish you the best.
60460,<3
60461,I am SO proud of you!
60462,You just did one of the hardest things ever!
60463,Stick to your guns.
60464,"When you feel willing to take him back (and you will feel that), come back here for support."
60465,You did a difficult thing and it’s ok to feel sad about it.
60466,We’re here.
60467,Adding: You’ve now told the Universe that you are worth more.
60468,"💝 Shower yourself in love and goodness, fill up your tank."
60469,I was the top comment on the other post and wanted to reiterate my update to you.
60470,I am so proud of you!
60471,Please let me know if I can help you.
60472,"Otherwise, I wish you luck little one."
60473,You were smart enough and strong enough to know what happened to you was wrong.
60474,"You walked home in the middle of the night like an absolute boss and instead of dwelling or excusing his behavior, you reached out."
60475,You asked for support and you were able to listen to the advice and trust yourself.
60476,That takes courage.
60477,"Lastly, make sure you practice self care."
60478,Remember to feel love for yourself and for your mind.
60479,This will be important for grounding yourself.
60480,You need to take time to think about yourself and your wants and needs now.
60481,> Growing up my parents would fight a lot.
60482,"My dad did a lot worse than   
what my boyfriend did but my mom still stayed with him because she loves  
 him."
60483,"You know, people sometimes use the word ""love"" to mean something very different from what I understand it to mean."
60484,"So your dad did what he did, and your mom did what she did, and you grew up thinking that was how relationships were supposed to work."
60485,"Your ex-boyfriend might have the exact same history, and you standing up for yourself may have been the first time anyone ever informed him that ""love"" usually means that you don't hurt the other person on purpose."
60486,(News flash!)
60487,"And this:

>I told him that he he should get help and learn to control his anger so that he won't treat his next girlfriend like this."
60488,was PERFECT.
60489,I'm so proud of you for having the courage to protect your physical and emotional health by breaking up with him.
60490,"And I am in awe that you were strong enough to give him an opportunity to learn something, or at least realize that there are such things to be learned, at a time when you yourself were in pain and it would have been easier to just hang up."
60491,"On behalf of every person he ever has a relationship with in future, I thank you."
60492,But please do not volunteer to be one of them!
60493,You deserve so much more.
60494,"I am sending big Momma hugs to you, duckling."
60495,You're amazing.
60496,So proud of you!!
60497,!
60498,Sometimes Reddit saves a life xx
60499,You should read Why Does He Do That so you can avoid this kind of man in the future.
60500,"It changed my life, after being with someone who sounds like your ex."
60501,"Congrats, this should be celebrated!!"
60502,"Still though, Im not surprised if he start to try love bombing you later on to try and manipulate you into getting with him again."
60503,"Remember, real life is not a romance movie."
60504,"He doesn't respect you then, he wont respect you now."
60505,Or ever.
60506,"Op, thanks for the update."
60507,I am so glad you showed the wisdom and strength to make a hard but good decision.
60508,You rock!!!
60509,"Love, mom"
60510,"This update is great, thank u"
60511,"I'm so proud of you, my favoritest niece, you did what needed to be done and took care of you."
60512,"I know you feel guilty and sad, and that's totally normal."
60513,But do not let that brute back in your life.
60514,Now it's time to keep taking care of you.
60515,"If he has anger problems, he may decide to bother you."
60516,"If you for any reason feel unsafe, call the cops, yesterday."
60517,"If he keeps bothering you, get a restraining order."
60518,It won't keep you totally safe but it's a step in the right direction.
60519,"I don't want to scare you, but to be warned is to be prepared."
60520,"Again, I'm so proud of you."
60521,I can't wait to see you absolutely bloom!
60522,"And just know, I always have a bottle of wine on standby, just come on by."
60523,Omg thank goodness!
60524,I didn’t comment but I was rooting for ya.
60525,I am so proud of you.
60526,You did the right thing for your own safety and well-being and you also did the right thing for your ex boyfriend.
60527,"Hopefully, he takes your advice and seeks help."
60528,"Abuse runs in families, he probably learned that type of behavior from his parents just as you learned to tolerate it from yours."
60529,"We need more people like you who are willing to put their foot down and say that bad and dangerous behaviors are not acceptable coming from adults, even if it was what was modeled to you as a child."
60530,"You're putting an end to it and that is just so, so huge."
60531,I’m so happy for you!
60532,That is A+ self care ❤️
60533,"Thank you for the update, I've wondered and worried about you!"
60534,I'm so proud of you and I'm sorry to hear about the example you were given by your parents about relationships.
60535,You deserve someone who lifts you up and adds good things to your life.
60536,You will have ups and downs in any relationship but you deserve to be respected despite someone feeling upset with you.
60537,"(Not that your ex even had a real reason to be upset at all..)
Allow yourself to feel whatever you feel but also try to notice all the stress that has lifted without him around!"
60538,Better days are ahead.
60539,So happy for you and proud of you!
60540,!
60541,Im so freaking proud of your strength sweetheart!
60542,That wasn't an easy thing to do but you did it so well.
60543,Wishing all blessings on you 💜
60544,I am very proud of you.
60545,This wasn't easy.
60546,"I know, I've been there."
60547,"Crying and feeling sad afterward is normal, even taking into account his treatment of you."
60548,You are strong and brave and worth so much more than how you had been treated.
60549,We’re all so proud.
60550,This is a huge life lesson.
60551,You’ll be able to see red flags the next time around.
60552,"Sweetheart, love is so hard."
60553,We can’t help that we love someone and it hurts so much.
60554,It hurts to let them go and hurts to know that they don’t truly love us the way we love them.
60555,It’s okay to cry and grieve this relationship.
60556,He will try to get you back and just stay strong.
60557,You are doing the right thing even if it doesn’t feel like it.
60558,I’m proud of you for for standing up for yourself and setting boundaries.
60559,You should be proud too.
60560,I wish I could hug you and pour all my love into it.
60561,You got this.
60562,"It was the best decision for you, we tend to put others first in so many situations that we forget our own"
60563,I'm inspired by your strength!
60564,"The way your dad treated your mom is a legacy burden on your back, and you've just taken a huge step towards throwing it off."
60565,Your future relationships and your children's future relationships (if you choose to raise any kids) will be better because of this choice and its pain.
60566,The love you've shown yourself will spread to everything you touch.
60567,You can do the right thing and still be sad about it.
60568,That's okay!
60569,I'm proud of you.
60570,You did the right thing.
60571,I'm not surprised your parents have a similar dynamic.
60572,"Do some research on ""the cycle of violence""."
60573,It's pretty common for people who grew up watching an abusive/toxic relationship to end up in one.
60574,You have just made the first step in breaking the cycle.
60575,Congratulations.
60576,Hugs.
60577,"I’m proud of you, boo."
60578,I'm so proud of you being so brave and assertive.
60579,You will be sad for a while and that's normal.
60580,You just had a breakup and breakups are hard regardless of who decided to breakup.
60581,You deserve to be happy and you will be.
60582,Just keep advocating for yourself when you're shown disrespect.
60583,Thankyou for sharing that you broke up with him and that you're safe.
60584,"Be careful of any attempts by him to show how he's changed, it's all a show."
60585,"Wow, I am so proud of you!"
60586,You did something very hard and were so brave!
60587,I hope you do a lot to take care of yourself and enjoying life!
60588,I'm so glad and so proud of you.
60589,That is a tough thing to do.
60590,"Good for you, and I hope he gets better, too."
60591,This is such a great update.
60592,Thanks for letting us know.
60593,You did the best thing possible for yourself.
60594,"And as an aside, you did the best thing for your ex as well."
60595,If he has any hope of redemption it will come if his grief & remorse are real AND he takes strong therapeutic actions to reform himself.
60596,"But until/unless he takes many of those steps towards positive change, he will be a garbage partner for anyone."
60597,Gratz to you for making a wise decision & sticking to your guns.
60598,Your future is looking bright.
60599,"Just because you're sad about your choice, doesn't mean it was the wrong choice."
60600,I hope you can work towards some peace and some confidence and all that other good stuff
60601,An ex did this :( he left me at McDonald’s and I had to beg for him to get me.
60602,"Damn, I’ve dated pieces of shit"
60603,You absolutely did the right thing.
60604,"I'm proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself."
60605,"Not only did you stay strong through his emotional manipulation, but you stayed strong and broke generational trauma!"
60606,I am SO proud of you!
60607,"You've done a very tough thing, but the growth you're experiencing will resonate with you for the rest of your life."
60608,Thank you so much for the update.
60609,I have been thinking about you.
60610,What you did was very tough.
60611,You are strong.
60612,Stay strong when he tries to get back together.
60613,"He may truly mean to change, but you can’t go back without it happening again and getting worse - no matter what he says."
60614,"You deserve a healthy, loving relationship."
60615,We are all here for you if you need us.
60616,Good for you!
60617,"It’s not an easy thing to do, but you did it."
60618,Hang in there!
60619,"I’m so glad you broke up with him, and you did exactly right following that advice."
60620,Please don’t get trapped into thinking it’s your job to ‘fix him’ for the next girl.
60621,Not your problem and is another way for him to justify staying in contact with him.
60622,Great job!
60623,!
60624,You did something your mother hasn’t been capable of: protect yourself from an abusive partner and remove yourself from a dysfunctional relationship.
60625,Good job!
60626,"Remember, sometimes the role models we look to from our childhood and family are modeling what NOT to do."
60627,I remember your post and I’m so proud of you!!
60628,That was a hard thing to do but the best decision you could have made.
60629,Know your worth and fuck off to anyone who can’t respect it.
60630,"I'm so proud of you, sib!"
60631,You did the right thing.
60632,I know leaving an abusive relationship can hurt.
60633,Especially if you didn't know it was abusive.
60634,But *you* deserve to be loved.
60635,And I hope you find your soulmate.
60636,I’m so proud of you.
60637,"I know it’s still sad and shitty, but focus on the boundaries you’ve set for yourself and they will pull you through :)"
60638,You are a strong person!
60639,Very proud of you.
60640,You deserve someone who treats you like gold.
60641,It is hard to do.
60642,I’ve been there.
60643,An ex bf did this to me too.
60644,"(but I only left after he hit me) 
It was hard to leave at first, but it gets way easier in time & you avoided any further escalation."
60645,You should be so proud of yourself.
60646,Happy healing.
60647,I'm so proud of you and so relieved.
60648,"You're a smart cookie,  and you're brave."
60649,"I know you're sad,  but that ongoing threat is over and life is going to get better."
60650,"Next guy, wait a long time to call him boyfriend, these things take time."
60651,People relax into who they are and then you see the truth.
60652,Xo so glad you're okay.
60653,Big hugs!
60654,"Not a mom, more like a eccentric uncle."
60655,Just wanted to tell you.
60656,That I'm proud of you.
60657,Breaking up with him took a great deal of courage and strength.
60658,Remember your success in this.
60659,And that your able to successfully take such actions.
60660,This will help you in future relationships and other circumstances in your life ahead.
60661,Remember that you are worthy of better and capable of acting on it.
60662,"Once again, I am very proud of you."
60663,Hugs!!!!!
60664,Stay strong.
60665,You will find someone better.
60666,"He needs to fix himself, and I can promise you he won’t if you didn’t break up with him."
60667,He would have put on a show for a week or two and then gone right back to his old habits.
60668,He has a long road to get better.
60669,"For anyone to change, they must be 1) willing and 2) capable."
60670,He might change.
60671,He might not.
60672,I can tell you that my ex refused to change for me.
60673,"I suspect his new girlfriend will see he hasn’t changed, either, and it will be a rude awakening for her."
60674,"But not my monkey, not my circus anymore!"
60675,!
60676,You did awesome.
60677,♥️
60678,It takes so much courage to do what you just did!
60679,You're taking care of your physical safety and mental health.
60680,You did incredible!!
60681,"In time, after you've been able to process your feelings and heal from this experience you will realize how much you have to be proud of."
60682,"Not only did you take care of yourself, but keeping your strength despite his deceiving words, and ultimately suggesting he seek out help to confront his anger issues shows such maturity and compassion."
60683,This Mumma is so proud of you!
60684,"Be gentle with yourself, you deserve it."
60685,💚
60686,Thank you for the update.
60687,You made the right move.
60688,Yes girl!
60689,Don’t allow yourself to be treated poorly!
60690,Know your worth!!
60691,Super proud of you!
60692,Don’t look back!
60693,Block him everywhere and try not to be alone for the next few months.
60694,Don’t engage at all.
60695,If you answer a text or phone call he will keep contacting you.
60696,I’m so proud of you!
60697,"Not just for breaking up, but before that-for reaching out to your moms, and being willing to take the comments to heart and reflect on your relationship."
60698,moving on is is going to be at times hard but uve taken the most courageous first step.
60699,u know ur worth and u took the actions necessary.
60700,were proud of u <3
60701,I wish young me had listened to the warnings and had the resolve to dump my abusive boyfriend like this.
60702,It would have saved me from wasting 7 years of my youth that I'll never get back.
60703,"Good job, damn I'm so proud of you."
60704,You did the right thing.
60705,You deserve someone who values you.
60706,There are a lot of really wonderful men out there.
60707,"That's fucking awesome, you did it!"
60708,"Just a warning though, now comes the detox period."
60709,A toxic relationship is literally like a drug that your brain needs to be weaned from.
60710,It's gonna hurt.
60711,I'm so proud of you!
60712,I'm glad you're safe.
60713,Sending you healing hugs.
60714,I’m so glad you’re out of there.
60715,Be safe as this goes forward.
60716,"There will be times that you get a bit lonely as you sort yourself out after this, but it is very possible to be happy, as well."
60717,Aim for the happy.
60718,">>…he should get help…

May I suggest that it might help you to talk to a therapist, too?"
60719,History tends to repeat itself; sometimes there are variations in the repeat.
60720,Conversations with a therapist would not be about your BF.
60721,There is something called trauma bonding.
60722,It is well worth learning more about it.
60723,I’m really glad you came to this sub  originally and glad that you came back to update us.
60724,I wish you the very best going forward.
60725,❤️
60726,"Girl, you did an amazing job."
60727,So proud of you.
60728,It hurts but it was the right thing.
60729,You did the right thing.
60730,"Maybe he'll work on himself and become a better partner, maybe he won't."
60731,You don't need to be stuck waiting for that outcome.
60732,Love from Auntie Nutter
60733,"So proud of you, sis!"
60734,"Undoing generational trauma & not repeating our parents’ mistakes is SO HARD, but I’m so glad you’re on this journey."
60735,You’re AMAZING and STRONG and CAPABLE!
60736,🙌🏻💪🏻👊🏻
60737,Do not shed another tear over this fellow.
60738,"You are mourning a man that never was, and never will be."
60739,He is dangerous with his gaslighting of you and he may hurt you.
60740,"Do not text or answer his calls, and stay somewhere safe for awhile."
60741,"I have been where you are at and it changed my life, and my career."
60742,Good luck to you.
60743,I care.
60744,💗
60745,"I know it’s extremely difficult, but it’s a huge step in the right direction, I’m extremely proud of you ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
60746,-huuuugggggggsssssss- the hard part is over
60747,"Sweetheart, just stopping by to say I Love You and I hear your strength and that makes me know that there’ll always be more challenges but I believe everything’s going to be alright and that makes me happy-content.💜💕💞💓"
60748,"You are so, so brave."
60749,"I think you are on a great journey of knowing yourself and what you want and need, and not settling for less."
60750,Yay!!!!!!!!
60751,"Not that you're sad, that part's not good, but I'm so glad you chose the way you did!"
60752,"The sadness is normal, even though you chose to end the relationship, and it will pass, and the self-respect and wisdom you'll gain from this will more than make up for it."
60753,Be proud of yourself!!!
60754,🙌💜
60755,Very well done and Yay!!!
60756,That took guts and you stood up for yourself really well.
60757,Stay strong- if he starts harassing you- write here again and let us know.
60758,We want you to have the best life possible.
60759,Lots of Love to you Dear.
60760,"Sweetheart, I wish I had been so brave at your age."
60761,"This act, this line, this behavior that you said no to?"
60762,I'm so proud of you.
60763,"So very, very proud."
60764,"You might not know it, but you are starting on a path of freedom and joy."
60765,"All my love and best wishes, darling."
60766,"Aw, honey, this takes me back to when I had to break up with a guy who was no good for me in my youth."
60767,"It’s hard, and it got lonely for a while but I was able to grow up and become truly independent and find myself."
60768,"It was the best thing for me, knowing my strength and knowing what I’m capable of has got me through a lot of good and bad times since then."
60769,"You’re gonna be great, you already have so much wisdom and clarity!"
60770,I'm so damn proud of you.
60771,"It's hard, but you did the right thing."
60772,You did such a hard thing… it wasn’t breaking up with him.
60773,It was realizing your worth.
60774,Congrats.
60775,Thank you so much.
60776,It was very hard to do.
60777,Thank you.
60778,I'll ignore it if he calls again and I'm not going to go back to him.
60779,Thank you so much.
60780,Thank you.
60781,Growing up with my parents like that was confusing.
60782,What happened at home was horrible but it was so normal to me.
60783,I never really knew what a healthy relationship looked like.
60784,I didn't know what was considered taking it too far and what wasn't.
60785,Then I keep thinking that my mom always forgave my dad for doing worse than what he did so maybe I should forgive him.
60786,It's amazing that there was such insight here.
60787,"This is something that took me decades to recognize, and even longer to break the cycle."
60788,OP did an amazing job at handling this so level headed
60789,Thank you
60790,Thank you and I am going to block him on everything.
60791,Thank you
60792,Thank you so much.
60793,It did hurt a lot but I'm glad that I did it.
60794,I'm even feeling a bit better already.
60795,Thank you.
60796,I do feel sad but I'm glad that I did it.
60797,Thank you so much.
60798,I do think I'll be better at noticing the red flags next time.
60799,Thank you so much.
60800,I won't forget.
60801,Yeah I'm still sad but it's getting better.
60802,I'm glad that I don't have to worry about his insane reactions anymore.
60803,"Yeah, when I was in therapy I realized that we don’t pay enough attention to the converse of the golden rule."
60804,"You talk about how you should treat other people the way you would want to be treated, and that has its own opportunities to be distorted."
60805,"But I also think that we need to say to ourselves, treat yourself the way you would want someone else to be treated."
60806,We are often so much better to other people; we will advocate for them when we might not have a cake for ourselves.
60807,"We would say to our friends, “you deserve a better boyfriend/job/roommate.” But we don’t say that to ourselves"
60808,That's honestly a tough question for me to answer.
60809,I didn't deserve to be treated like that by anyone.
60810,I deserve to be treated better but sometimes I feel like don't deserves much.
60811,Thank you so much.
60812,The part about guilt helped a lot.
60813,Thank you.
60814,I already blocked him on everything and I haven't spoken to him since.
60815,"Unfortunately, I had an exam yesterday and a bunch of assignments due and I also had work."
60816,So I didn't get a chance to just sit around and be sad and take care of myself.
60817,But I'm free today so I'm going to do that.
60818,I love this comment.
60819,"Thank you for taking the time to write all that, it's really helpful."
60820,If I ever feel tempted to get back with him I'll keep reminding myself of what he did and how he treated me and I'll come back to these comments.
60821,Seconding this read.
60822,It's available for free if you search the title.
60823,This helps you spot abuse and how to respond.
60824,I grew up with a super toxic relationship model with my parent's marriage.
60825,I have never been in a relationship that bad but I have been in some really crappy ones.
60826,Like I knew 'I don't want that' but I didn't know what I did want.
60827,"The best way to say it is I could recognize toxic, but not recognize healthy or even mildly toxic."
60828,"A book that helped me frame & recognize healthy relationships was ""Attached"" by Levine & Heller."
60829,I recommend this just as much as the first book.
60830,Thou art a stout person!
60831,very fustian of thee.
60832,"Thee deserve someone who is't treats thee like gold

60836,I am proud of you.
60837,"You did the right thing and worked through the hard emotions, instead of just taking the easy way out by staying with him."
60838,Your life will be better in the long run for it.
60839,You really did the right thing.
60840,"You might doubt yourself or start to trust him again, but don’t."
60841,You did the right thing.
60842,I promise you.
60843,"I’m glad you didn’t go back IRL, it IS more dangerous in person, and please stay strong."

60850,Wanted to comment to you here on the top comment.
60851,I'm VERY proud of you!
60852,"As a woman who survived 10 years of abuse while married to a man who did every type of abuse you can name to me, I know how hard it was."
60853,However you have allowed yourself to escape a life of misery & pain.
60854,I still suffer from PTSD & I'm 10 years out from being out of my abusive marriage & 8 years into a happy & healthy relationship.
60855,Some scars will probably never fully fade.
60856,"In the end, feel the sadness but be proud of yourself."
60857,I'm proud of you!
60858,You are my hero.
60859,"Download Bumble, Tinder, Farmers Only, whatever you gotta do, and talk to people who are kind and normal."

60863,* You’ve got this.
60864,We are behind you.
60865,">treat yourself the way you would want someone else to be treated

I like this."
60866,I often treat others better than I treat myself.
60867,In my last post some of the comments asked me what I would of said to a friend in that situation.
60868,I  thought to myself that I would of told them to break up with him because they deserve better than that kind of treatment.
60869,Then everything sort of just clicked.
60870,I’m so sorry you had to watch your father abusing your mother.
60871,They both taught you that people have no value.
60872,The good news is you left your boyfriend and that’s the first step in changing your past and future.
60873,Hooray!
60874,Celebrate that.
60875,It’s a huge deal!
60876,!

60879,Good bot
60880,Hi thank you so much.
60881,I'm sorry that you've been through all that.
60882,The people like you that shared your experiences in the comments are the ones that helped me gain the courage to break up with him.
60883,And I'm going come back to these comments if I ever feel tempted to get back with him.
60884,Twenty years removed from my abusive childhood and still suffer its effects.
60885,Very proud of you both!
60886,Thank you.
60887,I'll try again eventually but right now I think I'm better off being single for a while.

60897,It's night & day.
60898,One day your Knight in shining armour will come along & show you how a man really treats woman!
60899,I'd fully recommend reading a book called *Why Does He Do That?
60900,* by Lundy Bancroft.
60901,It's about how abusers think and it's written to help people realise when they're being devalued and controlled.
60902,It saved my life.
60903,I'd recommend it to everyone but I think you might find it helpful to feel a bit better about making the decision to break up.
60904,I'm sorry that you're feeling sad right now (and just want to validate that it's okay to be sad about it - and it's a great idea to take time for yourself).
60905,Really proud of you for putting yourself first!
60906,Thank you and I'm definitely going to read that book.
60907,A lot of people in the comments have recommended it.
60908,"Tampons don't take away your virginity

You lose iron so make sure to replace it in your diet

Cups and discs can hold more than a Tampons or pad of you're a heavy Bleeder."
60909,Adding this: always pee right after sex to help prevent UTIs.
60910,"And if your cramps are bad, talk to your doc about taking 800mg of ibuprofen at once."
60911,"Also, if you donate to food shelves or homeless shelters or for foster teens, consider donating sanitary products."
60912,Stress can also alter the length of your menstrual cycle!
60913,"I use Clue to track, and for two years, my cycles were 40 days long whenever I moved states twice a year!"
60914,"It’s your body saying “you’re under a bit of stress right now, let’s delay ovulation.”"
60915,Can I add to this?
60916,Because this is SO good!
60917,Let’s talk cycle length.
60918,"28 days is average just like Mom said, but your cycle can be as long as 40 days or as short as 21 days and still be totally normal!"
60919,Your period can vary in length too!
60920,Anything between 2-7 days is totally normal.
60921,Most people with uteruses lose between 3-5 tablespoons of blood.
60922,Some people have super heavy periods and some people have super light periods.
60923,If your period lasts longer than 7 days or you’re needing to change your pad/tampon more than once an hour (even if it’s only for a day or 2) then you should definitely talk to your doctor!
60924,You may have “menorrhagia” and there’s things they can do to help.
60925,"On the topic of cervical mucus or discharge, some people only have a little and some people have a lot!"
60926,"That’s normal too, if you’re itchy, smell foul (think fishy or generally really bad), or your discharge is weird colors, your vagina needs a check up and it’s absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about!"
60927,"Speaking of color, cervical mucus can range in color!"
60928,"It can be thin and watery, like egg whites, or creamy."
60929,It can range from white to light yellow and that’s normal!
60930,Did you know your cervical mucus can be acidic and bleach your panties?
60931,Guess what?
60932,That’s normal too!
60933,It’s okay for you to have a smell down there!
60934,It’s completely normal.
60935,"Your diet, how much water you drink, what medicines you take, where you are in your cycle, health conditions, and more can affect your smell."
60936,"Coppery, creamy, musky?"
60937,*Normal!
60938,"* 

Definitely ask Mom if you have questions but Auntie is happy to answer too if she can’t."
60939,:)
60940,"I misread the title as ""masterbation"" instead of menstruation."
60941,"I thought, ""Oh, good idea!"
60942,A mom here will tell people to only use properly shaped dildos for their butts.
60943,"There's too many accidents of objects getting lodged and folks going to the ER."""
60944,"But this is good info, too."
60945,"Also to add to this : if you think the pain is too bad, that's ok!"
60946,You can get it looked at and you can get things to help it!
60947,"My pain was ignored and they kept telling me to just deal with it, because all women had it."
60948,"This was pain that would make me puke, pass out or cry."
60949,"(I've since had an operation to help out and living pain free since ❤️) 

This kind of pain is NEVER normal and don't let them tell you otherwise!"
60950,"You deserve to live a pain free life, no matter what other people do!"
60951,An amazing resource is MamaDoctorJones on YouTube.
60952,"She's a practicing OB/GYN, she has four kids, she's staunchly supportive (tries to always use inclusive language) and generally does a great job educating."
60953,"""If your vagina is sick, take it to a doctor."""
60954,"I will add (because I’m currently going through the transition into menopause) that while your body is finishing it’s fertility years, everything you’ve learned about your cycle changes."
60955,"Timing, duration, heaviness, all now a crapshoot."
60956,"And if you have thyroid issues, please be aware that estrogen affects thyroid function and as your estrogen levels change it can affect your thyroid as well."
60957,"As a guy I can't add much that the fine women in this thread haven't covered, but I'll say for girls starting to date men and dealing with periods - a lot of guys are ignorant of sexual health and how periods work and stuff, that's unfortunately the result of poor sexual health education and/or purity culture."
60958,"But if a guy's actively *disgusted* by period stuff or unwilling to learn about it then he's immature and a douchbag, full stop."
60959,"This applies to boyfriends, fathers, brothers, really any guys in your life."
60960,"Also, if you are ADHD and are on meds, but you notice that your meds don’t seem to be working as well in the week leading up to and during your period, that is completely normal!"
60961,"It really sucks, but the higher levels of progesterone and estrogen basically counteract the stimulant that you are taking for your ADHD."
60962,Try to eat more protein (helps the absorption of your meds) and stay away from citric acid (neutralizes your meds).
60963,I hope it's OK to add some anecdotal input.
60964,PMS or PMT in the UK can have a lot of symptoms that you may not associate with your menstrual cycle.
60965,"I used to get really clumsy beforehand, dropping things, stumbling, just general physical awkwardness leading to ouches."
60966,Clots are gross---and normal.
60967,"If you think you are the only person who is ever made an emergency pad out of toilet paper in a public bathroom, you most certainly are not."
60968,You may feel your cycle at some point as a tiny pinch on your left or right over it as the egg is released.
60969,They used to say it was our imagination but it is not.
60970,All of this great info!
60971,I would also add that if you have very painful periods or if your cycle suddenly changes you should reach out to your doctor too.
60972,"For some people it won’t mean that anything is wrong, but very painful periods can mean there an issue that can be addressed."
60973,"I will also say if you ever have a doctor tell you your period pain or other menstrual symptoms are just in your imagination, or dismiss them in some other way, find a different doctor."
60974,"Pay attention to your period and learn what's ""normal"" for you."
60975,"Suddenly experiencing a much heavier than normal flow or really bad cramps when they're usually mild, or a period that lasts seven days when it's usually three?"
60976,Talk to your doc.
60977,This should be a pin.
60978,I remember when I first got mine I was horrified to find out it lasted several days.
60979,Everyone always said “once a month” so I took that to mean you bled literally once in the month.
60980,I would have loved someone to have walked me through.
60981,Oooh oh!
60982,May I add on?
60983,"If something does not feel right about your period, speak to a OBGYN or primary care doctor about it."
60984,Personally I find female ones a lot more understanding but there are good male ones too; do your research.
60985,"If a doctor is dismissive of your symptoms, refuses to do any investigation or makes you feel you feel uncomfortable, find someone else."
60986,Menstruation can be uncomfortable and hard to deal with but it shouldn't be interfere with your life in a severe way.
60987,"It is possible for you to have PCOS, fibroids/tumors, hormone issues or other problems with the system down there."
60988,"Heavy flow (changing thickest pad every hour), passing out, cramps/low back pain that hinder movement, migraines, severe nausea, clots passed are larger than a quarter/large coin, duration longer than 7 days or extreme mood swings are abnormal symptoms that should be addressed with a doctor."
60989,There may be others I'm not listing.
60990,"If you feel something's wrong,.go see a doctor."
60991,Thanks Mum.
60992,This is very helpful.
60993,I’m in my late twenties and I’ve never learned so much about periods.
60994,Thanks mom!
60995,Can we chat about mood changes around periods?
60996,I have a pretty regular cycle (about 28-30 days).
60997,During my follicular phase and ovulation I feel really good.
60998,(Libido is higher too) and then once I hit luteal phase it’s all downhill from there.
60999,"Irritable, low patience, very depressed (sometimes even have suicidal ideations) lack of motivation, extremely tired."
61000,My luteal phase sucks.
61001,I’m pretty sure I have PMDD.
61002,"About a day or two after I start my period, my mood picks right back up."
61003,It’s crazy.
61004,What are everyone else’s mood changes like?
61005,Anyone else struggle with PMDD?
61006,I'd like to add to this!
61007,"If you're exercising or into sports, you can also have very different period flows."
61008,Please talk to your GYN if you notice that you miss a period or have questions about why it's not the same as it used to be.
61009,"Hey mum, I’m pregnant at the moment, due it about 8 weeks, I know that there’s a few weeks of bleeding after giving birth, but usually how long after that until I get back on to a regular cycle?"
61010,Also do you happen to know if the pill can affect your ability to breast feed?
61011,Big Sis here.
61012,"Thanks for the post, Mom!"
61013,Just here to add a little for those of us who do not have normal periods: abnormal periods are sooo common!
61014,"As many have said, your cycle will be unique to you, but if something seems off, talk to a doc!"
61015,I started my first period at 13 years old and it was normal for the next four years.
61016,"At 17, my period stopped."
61017,"Just poof, gone."
61018,For an entire year.
61019,I talked with my doc and she diagnosed Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
61020,I went on an oral birth control to regulate my hormones and bring my period back.
61021,I’ve been taking birth control for my periods for 17 years without major incident.
61022,My periods are completely different than they were pre-birth control.
61023,"If something is going on with your cycle, it may not be hard to fix."
61024,Talk to your medical professional!
61025,"ETA: and if your doctor doesn’t listen to your concerns, see another doc!"
61026,You have to advocate for yourself because you know your body best.
61027,"To add to this:

Endometriosis."
61028,Look into it.
61029,Every single person with a menstrual cycle should - I personally believe it's a lot more common than we know of.
61030,Endometriosis at base definition is the presence of endometrial-like tissue OUTSIDE of the uterus.
61031,It feeds off of estrogen and can produce its own.
61032,Any adhesions have their own 'mini periods' during your period as well.
61033,Very painful.
61034,Very gross.
61035,Very.... dangerous when attached to vital organs (like mine is).
61036,BRING.
61037,IT.
61038,UP.
61039,"IT NEEDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT MORE, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US THAT HAVE IT, OR THINK THEY MAY HAVE IT."
61040,Also if you have started having your period don't be alarmed if the first year or so you're a little irregular.
61041,However if the irregularities continue past the one year point please bring it up to your doctor.
61042,Birth control can really help with bringing that cycle in to heel.
61043,Don't be like me who spent her entire highschool years skipping periods frequently up to 6 months at a time.
61044,"mom is it normal for your period to go for 3 days, *stop for a full day,* and then resume for 2 more??"
61045,it's been doing this for a couple years now and i've never heard anyone else talk about that happening.
61046,I want to add my own piece!
61047,Pay attention to your headaches!
61048,Do they affect your vision at all?
61049,"Does one eye get blurry, or feel like there’s a film on it?"
61050,That’s a migraine with an aura.
61051,Tell your doctor about it.
61052,"They’ll make a note that you can’t have estrogen based birth control, and that’s okay."
61053,There’s progesterone based kinda as well.
61054,Taking estrogen based kinds with those headaches can put you at risk for an aneurism.
61055,I only figured out I have this when a professor explained this all in one of my classes.
61056,I’m 21 lol.
61057,Love auntie 💕
61058,Thanks mom.
61059,I'm 20 years old and I learned so much from this.
61060,I grew up in purity culture and with extremely religious parents.
61061,I wasn't really taught anything about sex or menstruation.
61062,I wasn't even allowed to use tampons.
61063,Like how big of a concern it is to always have irregular periods?
61064,I had my first period when I was 13 and ever since then it has always been irregular.
61065,Like I would either get my period earlier than expected or later than expected.
61066,This month my period actually came two weeks late which freaked me out because I recently became sexually active and I have a huge fear of becoming pregnant even though we always use protection.
61067,ETA: Also are when should I be concerned about cramps?
61068,I don't get cramps often but when I do it's unbearable.
61069,I usually need to take 4 tylenol for it to stop and that still doesn't make the pain go away completely.
61070,Also I should be seeing a gyno right?
61071,But the thought of that just makes me feel so scared and anxious and uncomfortable.
61072,How do I get over this?
61073,And how do I find a good doctor that I can trust?
61074,"I'm going to add one more semi-related thing 

Bodies are weird, kids."
61075,Really weird.
61076,"They do all sorts of things that are weird, but normal."
61077,Google is a double edged sword.
61078,"I think its easy to go down a rabbit hole and think it's something big and scary, when it's really just a weird, but normal variation."
61079,One thing I did not know and was not prepared for was the differing colors of blood throughout my cycle!!
61080,I remember freaking out the first time I noticed old blood (like brown/black colored).
61081,I have had sexual partners comment on it too asking if it is normal.
61082,It tooootally is!
61083,"Blood oxidizes and as it does, it can change the appearance."
61084,"I'm so happy with the gender neutral language, I'm a trans guy who experienced menstrual cycles before :) 

(Nothing else to add, just makes me happy seeing inclusive utilitarian language in the wild!)"
61085,Biological disorders like pmdd exist.
61086,"If you get extremely suicidal, homicidal, beyond irratible and irrational..I suggest you go to a gyno immediately."
61087,It can be treated with hormonal birth control and therapy..
61088,I wish we didn't have to suffer this.
61089,r/PMDD has been a great help with my condition
61090,Big Sis here.
61091,This is mostly for anyone who hasn't started their period yet.
61092,"If you are having cramps but no blood and it's been happening for a couple of months, check with your gyno ASAP."
61093,You might have a condition that causes your hymen to be completely closed off.
61094,I had no idea what was happening to me for 6 months until I ended up in an emergency room.
61095,"And if you have a hysterectomy, if they leave your ovaries you will still have a cycle!"
61096,No one told me about that and it was interesting - all the symptoms except the cramping and bleeding.
61097,I still had back pain and hormonal acne…super weird.
61098,"In my case, reducing inflammation is what helped the most, so cutting out foods high in histamines, as well as meat and dairy, was tremendously helpful."
61099,I don't have periods but this is neat.
61100,"From what I've read the human body is inherently female so if you put estrogen into a male body it can have symptoms similar to PMS, like headaches, diarrhea, mood swings, and gut cramps which I'm not looking forward to."
61101,I'm sure it's much worse for cis women so I'm kind of hesitant to call it a period.
61102,[deleted]
61103,"Heads up, if you have ADHD, it is normal for your meds to be less effective while menstruation is going on."
61104,"Let your doc know if its really bad, they can set an adjustment for the days during your cycle where the hormones are out of whack."
61105,"If you have sex just before your period, will the period wash everything away and the egg won't implant?"
61106,"I don't exactly know when I ovulate, though I think it would have been at least a week before the period."
61107,"Thanks mom :)

Edited to add another question."
61108,I have constant discharge and have been told for years that I have BV.
61109,I can't ever seem to get rid of it.
61110,"I don't really have any symptoms though, could that just be my normative state?"
61111,"I do worry a bit that if I get pregnant I could miscarry, as BV increases the chances of that."
61112,Kinda related but not!
61113,"I’m 26, and my mom never taught me how to properly shave."
61114,Iv looked up sooo many videos and still struggle with razer bumps.
61115,What do I do?
61116,Iv tried everything and nothing seems to work :(
61117,Does anyone else get incredibly tired when ovulating?
61118,It feels like I can sleep all day and it makes no difference.
61119,Both my mom and I are like this
61120,[deleted]
61121,"Hey, Mom,

Is it normal to have an increased libido during the luteal phase?"
61122,Hey Sweeties!
61123,"Additional Mom here and just wanted to add that for those who use tampons, if you have any issues with a forgotten or ""lost"" tampon, check with your doctor because it's super common and no matter what, your doctor will easily help remove it."
61124,Zero embarrassment.
61125,I’d also like to add something!!
61126,"If you are experiencing abnormalities, PLEASE talk to your gyno or PCP!!"
61127,"I went undetected for PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) for almost 15 years, and was diagnosed this past spring."
61128,"The primary red flags are extremely heavy bleeding, frequent bleeding (8+ days of flow), or straight up no bleeding."
61129,"I was the heavy, got put on birth control, got off of it, and didn’t have one for almost 7 months."
61130,*Advocate for yourself*.
61131,No one cares you like you care about you.
61132,"Ask questions, demand an ultrasound and blood work, don’t let the gyno give you the “here’s some Metformin and Spironolactone, come back when you wanna get pregnant” treatment."
61133,"Read material, get online, and make connections with others because it’s a lot more common of a condition than people think ❤️"
61134,I’ll just add a quick thank you!
61135,I’ve been having the sharp pains since I was a teen (mid-30s now) and never knew it was from an egg releasing - I thought I had a mild hernia.
61136,Anyone know what to do about cramps
61137,I don't know if it counts but my boyfriend has been going on that since my period stopped when I started taking bc that it was unhealthy for me NOT to bleed.
61138,Since it's a known side effect I didn't think twice about it.
61139,Is there any truth to it being unhealthy?
61140,I also want to add a Thank you to every mom/sibling here.
61141,"When I first started my period I thought I was dying and after telling my mom bawling from the fear she made a joke about it and my dad was absolutely disgusted by it to the point he asked me to try and hide ANY evidence i was bleeding, I was always self conscious about it."
61142,I wish I had someone to talk me through it like this.
61143,Let's talk clots.
61144,They happen.
61145,"They feel strange, you'll never get used to them."
61146,"Large clots or frequent clots can be indicative of a condition endometrial hypoplasia (which is the medical term for an extra juicy uterus), it means the lining is very thick, generally because you're not ovulating and it is taking longer for your lining to shed."
61147,Clots will have more with irregular cycles.
61148,"They vary in size from, don't notice, to regulation american football (I'm only slightly joking)."
61149,"Just breathe, let them pass, then go to the toilet."
61150,"Wait until they stop since sometimes you'll get more than one, and it's more comfortable to wait then go."
61151,"Also girls, your iron levels can drop during your period, especially if you have an iron deficiency or anima."
61152,"Keep an eye out for your systems of low iron, and replenish."
61153,Don't take supplements for iron without a doctor's advice.
61154,During the time between your cervix closing and the end of the Luteal phase you might be uncomfortable or less comfortable having sex with than at other times because the cervix drops low while it is closed up and raises itself up during the more fertile times of your cycle.
61155,"Adding my own experience, in hopes that it will help others."
61156,I have PMDD.
61157,"I deal with depression and anxiety on the regular, but the week before my period, it’s a whole nother level."
61158,I’ve become suicidal and have acted on these thoughts.
61159,I have panic attacks.
61160,Severe depression during these times.
61161,"I’m 35 and it took a couple years of tracking my period as well as getting my period during 3 out of 4 baker acts, which means I was in the premenstral phase during the actual crisis."
61162,"I am not ashamed to take medication daily to regulate my mood and I track my periods to be prepared for the week prior, because it’s a given that it will be unpleasant to say the least."
61163,"There is NO SHAME in caring for your mental heath, no matter the cause."
61164,"I love you, and you matter."
61165,Can I add to this wonderful information?
61166,Menstrual or period migraines are a thing!
61167,A horrible thing...
61168,But your doctor can help.
61169,I couldn't take birth control because of my history of migraines.
61170,About a week before my periods would start I would have a migraine I couldn't stop.
61171,Finally my neurologist set up a vitamin and medication schedule that stopped the migraines.
61172,Good luck everyone!
61173,Has anyone else mentioned period diarrhoea and anal cramps?
61174,These are normal too.
61175,Also - get a period calender and note down your symptoms.
61176,"Right after our periods our hormone balance tends to support activity (we tend to feel more awake, more active), shortly before tends to be the opposite."
61177,"If you experience mood swings, that's okay."
61178,I'm always touchy as hell the week before my period - and knowing that makes it a lot easier to cope.
61179,Non-bloating food during your period is your friend.
61180,"You'll already be bloated as is, no need to make it worse."
61181,"If you're vegan and can't substitute iron with meat, red beets and soy beans are the ingredients you're looking for."
61182,And DO NOT OVERDOSE ON IBUPROFEN.
61183,It's not effective after a certain amount.
61184,Talk to your gynecologist if medication doesn't properly address cramps and keep looking until you find one that helps.
61185,I just read through a whole comment chain again with women talking about how often they exceed the recommended dosage for Ibuprofen during their periods.
61186,"Please don't do that, your liver will thank you for it."
61187,I'm so glad you've posted this.
61188,I wish I'd had a group like this - answering questions like this - when I was 13!
61189,"Duckies: Find a gynecologist you TRUST, who will give you straight answers."
61190,"If you EVER feel like the doc isn't listening to you or isn't explaining things in a way you understand, please speak up for yourself!"
61191,"The doc may have the credentials, but YOU live in your body and know how it feels and what it does."
61192,Be honest with your doc about your symptoms and questions (bring notes if needed!)
61193,and don't ever feel ashamed of asking questions.
61194,Your health and safety is the most important thing.
61195,There's nothing scarier or more infuriating than a doc dismissing your fears or minimizing your concerns.
61196,"If they do, start to find another doctor immediately."
61197,(Ask us if you need help searching - most of us mamas have had to find new doctors at one time or another.)
61198,"I had a doctor (briefly) who dismissed my chronic vulvar pain, saying that sex often ""just hurts"" and it's a fact of life."
61199,"Actual quote from this doctor: ""maybe try a glass of wine before sex?"""
61200,(Spoiler alert: Intercourse should not be painful.
61201,"I have vulvar vestibulitis, which is a legitimate condition that a legitimate doctor was able to diagnose immediately, without making me feel like a whining hypochondriac.)"
61202,"We're always here to support our sweet duckies, but your doctor should have your back (etc.)"
61203,as well.
61204,"(Also, don't forget your sunscreen, and make sure you're drinking enough water."
61205,❤️)
61206,"26yo afab adult, thought I knew everything there was too know about periods, but never knew why sometimes when I wiped it was that thick snot consistency."
61207,I was never considered & just figured regular vaginal discharge but never knew it was cervical mucus / meant I was ovulating.
61208,It's sad how the education system fails us in our own bodies (I was privately schooled and never had a single sex ed / reproductive health / basic body function health class).
61209,Thank you for this!
61210,"As a grown woman who grew up motherless, thank you."
61211,"I have 2 daughters, one of whom just started her period."
61212,This post is very helpful.
61213,Thank you so much.
61214,>A full menstrual cycle for a person in their fertile adult years lasts an average of 28 days.
61215,That does not mean that YOUR period will last 28 days.
61216,"Just like you might not be of average height or have average intelligence or average body temperature, there are a lot of variables."
61217,"Furthermore, the length of your cycle is going to change over time."
61218,I feel like this part is worded in a confusing way.
61219,"thank you so much, i have a question, my period always arrived like clockwork on the same date every month (let’s say 23rd to 27th) but recently it changed dates to early in the month (like 12th to 15th), why is that, should i be worried?"
61220,"God, I wish I would have had this when I got my period."
61221,I gave away a lot of my toys (including my bike) because I thought I was hemorrhaging or had leukemia (a la Quincy Jones).
61222,"Thanks, co-mom!"
61223,One thing I learned the hard way.
61224,Eating or drinking too much soy can mess with your periods and estrogen levels .
61225,"First time I tried to go vegan, I went overboard on the soy."
61226,"Ended up with a period that wouldn't end, with a flow level that was insane."
61227,Ended up on hospital and was given two units of blood.
61228,Had to go in birth control to stop my periods for a while.
61229,"Cut back on the soy, and haven't had problems since."
61230,... can we get one for perimenopause?
61231,"I want to add that pads don't stick well to certain underwear, it took me years to figure that out."
61232,"I would get frustrated and cry, and wonder what the hell I was doing wrong."
61233,Once I changed my underwear brand they started to stick to them.
61234,Is there a certain time after the egg stage happens that you can have unprotected sex and they can finish inside you and you won’t get pregnant?
61235,Also!
61236,"PMS is a bitch, and mood swings are common."
61237,"HOWEVER, your period should not make you majorly depressed or suicidal."
61238,"If this is you, look into someone called PMDD"
61239,Thank you for this.
61240,I stopped having my period (transitioned to male) but if I ever get it again this will be very helpful.
61241,Im a 31 year old grown ass woman and the “ok kiddos” in the title made me sit up straight and pay attention 😂 thanks mom 🙄😂😂😂
61242,"Having a COVID vaccine, getting COVID, or just being exposed can effect your cycle."
61243,I just had to add this here.
61244,Knowledge is power .
61245,"France is bacon

https://www.reddit.com/r/KidsAreFuckingStupid/comments/w59jdj/france_is_bacon/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
61246,"in phase 3/ovulation, if not on any birth control - you will have a lot more energy and be, well, horny."
61247,It’s nature’s way of ensuring you’ll reproduce.
61248,"If you’ve ever heard someone not on birth control getting pregnant when even though “we only did it the one time!”, it’s because that one time when you were really turned on was when you were ovulating."
61249,"TL/DR, when I was TTC (trying to conceive), I was 6 for 6 (all miscarriages, but that’s another story for another time) - didn’t even need an ovulation kit or test or to track my cycle."
61250,Super horny?
61251,must be “go time”!
61252,Got pregnant each time.
61253,Nature’s funny like that.
61254,"So if you don’t want to get pregnant and aren’t on the pill, invest in a good vibrator and stay home for 2-3 days."
61255,Re: cycle length.
61256,I was always really regular but then suddenly it started being 32 days or 21 instead of 28 and then I had food poisoning and it’s just been nearly 60 days!
61257,"What I’m trying to say is, anything and everything can throw your cycle off"
61258,Thank you so much for this.
61259,I'm well past 30 and I didn't know half of this stuff.
61260,"When I got my period I thought I was going to bleed until I was 50, I had no idea and no one gave me any info."
61261,I was so glad when it stopped.
61262,I just want to say that heavy periods are common but NOT NORMAL.
61263,I suffered for twenty years before anyone bothered to look into why.
61264,"In my case it was a hormone imbalance, and the simple solution was medication for hypothyroid."
61265,I went through all that pain for no reason.
61266,It's not jumbled up.
61267,"No, it's from the acidic nature of vaginal secretions."
61268,"All are, Some are more acidic than others, and it varies thru the month."
61269,But that acidity is what keeps the ecosystem in there working right.
61270,"Nope, not the washing machine."
61271,It's like in the lab (this you won't know but from personal experience managing an env lab) you can get teeeny amounts of acid on your clothes (that's a readon you wear a lab coat) or lab coat.
61272,"You don't see it bc it's dilute acid (weak strength)

But then, you wash the item 2x and 1 teeny hole is there."
61273,4x and 2 more teeny holes...
61274,Same for underwear.
61275,"Very weak acid, but wash it, then wear it more... Wash it then wear it... Wash it... Bam, Teeny holes."
61276,Have we had a comment/thread about dealing with blood stains?
61277,Cold water ONLY.
61278,Hot will set the stain.
61279,"Even if the stain is older, be it by hours or days."
61280,"Sometimes salt rubbed in, or left on top of liquid to soak it up can help."
61281,(Fun fact: this also works if you spill red wine on the carpet!
61282,"You've got to get to it while it's still mostly wet, though.)"
61283,"I have a pile of plain black full briefs for use during my period because I'm kinda lazy, I must admit."
61284,"The brand Period Panties from Harebrained are fun, too."
61285,"(NB: they're not Period underwear, they're panties with fun period-related puns/artwork on them, and black lining."
61286,You'll still need a pad/tampon/cup.)
61287,ETA: you can solve a lot of crises if you always carry a small bag with an extra set of knickers and some pads/tampons in it in your bag!
61288,"Boys, this goes for you, too!"
61289,(Though maybe not the knickers.)
61290,Having supplies with which to help a fellow human in need can make you a bona fide hero of the day.
61291,I want to add that tracking your cycle **is not** an effective birth control in itself.
61292,"It's great if you want to get pregnant, but if you don't, you need to take another form of BC (not the pull-out method either!"
61293,).
61294,What's menopause
61295,"Hi sister, wanted to add my two cents here."
61296,"When I was a first time mom, I read a lot of fear from other FTM threads about how they’re were worried a vaginal birth would tank their sex lives."
61297,I found that to be the opposite!
61298,Having two vaginal births actually made sex more comfortable and enjoyable for me!
61299,"Instead of worrying about that (if you’re pregnant), read up on pelvic floor therapy and pelvic floor prep BEFORE you give birth!"
61300,💗💗
61301,If you have cramps try not using tampons.
61302,Tampons can exacerbate cramps.
61303,Do not leave tampons in more than 4 hours.
61304,Toxic Shock Syndrome is real and can cause amputation and your life.
61305,If you have previously had TSS you should alternate between pads and tampons.
61306,Wash your hands before changing tampons and pads.
61307,You don't want to introduce any unnecessary germs/bacteria to the area.
61308,"Alternatives to pads, tampons and cups are period panties - disposable and nondisposable."
61309,I tried the disposable for the 1st time and it wasn't my first choice but it wasn't horrible.
61310,They were better than pads for heavy days as the absorbent area went all the way up the front and back.
61311,Reusable panties I love them as main and back up.
61312,I always get the highest absorbency.
61313,On days when I'm heaviest - bleeding through a regular pad in about 2 hours I have to be home to use it on its own.
61314,Otherwise I pair it with a pad to prevent leaks.
61315,Be careful of the type of birth control pills that you take.
61316,"There are estrogen only, progesterone only and combination pills."
61317,If you have endometriosis or fibroids you may want to stay away from estrogen only pills.
61318,And some of us will never have a normal or consistent cycle without the help of medication and that’s ok too.
61319,"It also doesn’t mean you won’t be able to have kids, but it might be a little trickier."
61320,Infertility is not discussed as openly as it should be!
61321,Ooh boy... As a Dad with a daughter this is all the information I needed but never wanted or knew how to learn about.
61322,Thank you all so much for sharing.
61323,I will now man up.
61324,"Learn it all, and be the source of knowledge my daughter needs when the time comes."
61325,Thank god that the sharp pain is normal.
61326,I was worried cause it always happens for me!
61327,"Could you please do one about menopause/perimenopause, next?"
61328,This hormonal stuff is...
61329,Difficult.
61330,!ALSO!
61331,"Everyone, please remember that the (emotional) feelings you have during pms/period are VALID."
61332,"What happens during your period (again, emotionally, that i personally have noticed) is you lose your bullshit protection."
61333,"A lot of times, these events bother you when you're not on your period, but it's not worth the frustration to try to get the other person to understand."
61334,"Example: A partner who consistently misses the laundry basket goes from, 'grr' and picking it up yourself, to, ""WHAT the FUCK?"
61335,Are you FIVE?
61336,"Pick up your damn laundry!!1!"""
61337,"""Hur hur, what are you, on the rag?"""
61338,*Sounds of unimaginably violence.
61339,"*

So I've been telling the men i come in contact with that, usually when they mention anything period."
61340,"It usually goes like, ""Why, yes!"
61341,I am on my monthly cycle.
61342,You should be very careful.
61343,"The biological construct that gives me the bullshit protection to put up with poor behavior during the rest of the month is gone."""
61344,"And then smile, either sweetly, or with alll the teeth and a little bit of crazy eye."
61345,They usually take a step back.
61346,"Oh, and make sure you look at them pointedly when you say the words poor behavior."
61347,It fixes a few questions for them.
61348,I'm here to add Super Low Vaginal PH.
61349,"I was never told about different levels and thought I was doing something wrong for how often I get yeast infections, but nope, just have very low PH."
61350,I was never told how much blood comes out in the first 2 or 3 days.
61351,When I had my 1st period at 14yrs I took a panty liner thinking it would be enough and went to sleep.
61352,I woke up in a poddle of blood.
61353,Also I didnt tell my mom becuase I was scared and thought I would be in trouble.
61354,I lose endurance strength on the first two days.
61355,"I know that's considered common, right?"
61356,I have a question.
61357,Some back story.
61358,I was on birth control for 10+ years.
61359,"Then I had a kid and my husband got a vasectomy so I thought, maybe I no longer need to add hormones and can go about it “naturally”."
61360,Well 5 years in and my cycles were getting worse and worse.
61361,"Cramps had come back and while the bleeding phase did come every month, is seemed to have been getting longer and longer (7-10days as opposed to 5 on BC)."
61362,I also developed adult acne.
61363,"I decided to try birth control again and my cycles are back to normal, no cramps, and I only bleed when I stop the birth control for a week."
61364,I haven’t gotten control of the acne yet but maybe it’s due to stress lol.
61365,I’m 36 now and have been back on birth control for about a year or so.
61366,"My question is, could this have been me slowly going into pre menopause and I just stunted it now?"
61367,Or will it happen regardless and maybe I just won’t get a bleeding phase when that starts?
61368,"I think my mom went into Menopause in her 40s so I dunno, I’m getting close lol."
61369,"I could Google but this thread has been so good, I thought I would ask here ♡"
61370,"I have a question, whenever my period ends if I self stimulate after I get another day of bleeding and not sure if this is normal or not."
61371,I don't get cramping just some blood.
61372,I'm almost 31 so I'm a bit ashamed to ask this...
61373,I'm (hopefully) done with the 3rd period I've had in a month.
61374,This one started and ended brown but was pink in the middle.
61375,It lasted  almost 2 weeks.
61376,"I'm up to date on my paps, I have no STDs or STIs."
61377,"As far as I know, no pregnancy."
61378,"I'm not on birth control for personal reasons, but my husband and I are safe, and I haven't been with anyone but him for going on 11 years."
61379,Can I make a question?
61380,Is it normal if your ovaries sometimes hurt a lot when you sneeze?
61381,Like when you have to sit down to support the pain
61382,I have to say thank you for opening up this topic!!
61383,"When I was in school, they only talked about this in a very basic manner."
61384,None of these details.
61385,This is so much more informative especially with it being an open discussion.
61386,I love this subreddit!!
61387,!
61388,When I'm on my period my cramps feel like my uterus is going to fall out.
61389,Which I'm experiencing currently.
61390,The only thing that helps is to put pressure on it like a baby laying there.
61391,Which I used to do when my daughter was a baby.
61392,I'd just lay her there and feel better.
61393,I honestly don't know if it's an issue that is Dr worthy.
61394,Thanks for sharing this!
61395,You’ve helped a lot of peeps.
61396,Vitex is a natural medicine and can be used to regulate your cycle.
61397,"I took birth control for over 8 years, stop it and my cycle was messed up (2 months without period etc)."
61398,Vitex was a game changer for me.
61399,Hormonal imbalances are real!
61400,I feel like we need a post about vaginismus as well!
61401,I have a question.
61402,"What does it mean if I haven’t had my period in 90+ days, not pregnant and I keep getting tired  very easily (like I can’t walk far these days without having to stop bc my legs feel like jelly)?"
61403,"To add:

IUD’s usually have a stabilizing effect on periods and/or make them lighter."
61404,"20% of women with an IUD stop having a period entirely (like myself, it’s awesome)."
61405,I’ve heard anecdotal stories of women who got an IUD and the period bleeding became constant and they had to switch to a different BC method.
61406,"I don’t have a question about menstruation specifically, but I have a chronic yeast infection, and I’ve had it for years now."
61407,"GYNs haven’t given me anything helpful for it (just routine meds), and I wanted to know if there’s a solution I haven’t tried/done yet."
61408,"If you're overweight/obese and missing periods, PLEASE request a doctor to do all of the necessary examinations."
61409,"Most of them, especially older doctors, will dismiss it as ""you need to lose weight"" but that's not the case."
61410,"I've had thyroid problems and insulin resistance since I hit puberty and no doctor ever told me those could affect my period, so I spent a good 6 years of my life constantly dieting, before I went to a new doctor at 18 and he told me that."
61411,"If a doctor insists on not looking every possibility, tell them to mention it on record that they refused to give you the examinations you requested."
61412,"Granted, it really could be just obesity (especially if you're a 45+on the BMI scale), but if you're below that it could be things like PCOS, endometriosis, thyroid issues, insulin resistance (which leads to diabetes!!!)"
61413,and a whole lot of other stuff.
61414,Is it bad to not have a period for years because of the contraceptive implant?
61415,Adding to the virginity thing: some women will not have a painful hymen tearing the first time they have sex.
61416,"This is not because something bad happened to you sexually that you can’t remember (or, as some men believe, because you were lying about your virginity) but because some women are born with less of a covering or none at all, some stretch instead of tear, and some tore early from normal things like riding a bike and they didn’t realize or remember."
61417,I tried flex discs for the first time yesterday (I'm 39) and *whoa mama* did my whole *world* change.
61418,"I don't think I'll *ever* go back to primarily pads/tampons for ""doin stuff"" days."
61419,"I used to use a cup, then I got an IUD."
61420,Please chat with your doc in that situation.
61421,Cups use suction and are not always recommended with an IUD.
61422,"Then again, the IUD lessened my period enough that mostly I can get away with period panties or a pad."
61423,"Tbh, if you have a light one - seriously, give period panties a try."
61424,They get washed and I don't feel like I'm wearing a diaper.
61425,"They don't take your virginity, but your hymen can be shaped in a way that makes you unable to put a tampon in."
61426,It's ok to break the hymen yourself if you really want to use tampons!
61427,Just do it safely.
61428,"Cups and discs are great for a lot and not so great for others, the same is true for period underwear, pads and tampons."
61429,"There is no right or wrong method, choose what works for you and what you feel confident and comfortable in."
61430,"When inserting a tampon, put it in deep."
61431,"Don't worry about not getting it out, that is what the string is for."
61432,"If it hurts, it's too shallow, try pushing in deeper as tampons shouldn't hurt when worn."
61433,"Everyone has different periods, some heavy or light."
61434,It says nothing about your fertility or health.
61435,Some advice from a heavy bleeder: most conversation is about tampons or pads.
61436,"If you have a heavy flow, you might find what works best for you is both."
61437,Tampon first with a pad for backup to get you through the night.
61438,"Cups can hold more so might work better for you, they just require more practice getting them in and out."
61439,"And again, you can also use a cup and a pad, or a tampon and period underwear, mix and match however you like."
61440,"Also to add: if you're struggling to get enough iron from your diet alone, for instance if you're veggie or vegan, remember you can buy over the counter iron tablets."
61441,"You will safely poop out excess iron so don't worry too much about getting too much (it makes your poop darker, so keep an eye on that)."
61442,"If you’re donating, consider donating tampons or discs."
61443,"A lot of places have free maxi pads, but they’re thick and uncomfortable."
61444,There’s always a need for tampons.
61445,"If cramps are consistently bad, ask your doctor about birth control to help make your period more bearable."
61446,Birth control isn't just contraception!
61447,"Imo, NSAIDS (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) are better than tylenol for period pain (don't mix NSAIDS if you like your stomach lining)

If you struggle with anemia, like I did, ask your doctor if iron supplements could help."
61448,"If you donate to a teen foster closet, make sure you know their policies."
61449,Some group homes don't allow plastic applicators because they can be used for self-harm.
61450,It's also the reason why Murphy's Law can always strike for some people!
61451,"Whenever I travel or go through a stressful time, I can guarantee that my period is going to add itself to the pile of things I need to worry about."
61452,And this can be any kind of stress!
61453,"Being sick takes a toll on your body and can affect your menstrual cycle, including COVID and even getting vaccinations."
61454,Basically your body is a very well working machine and it changes priorities based on what you need.
61455,"A lot of these variations are totally normal, but if you're ever uncertain, don't be afraid to chat to your doctor about it and get more personalised information."
61456,"(Oh, and a tangent?"
61457,You're not weird for bleaching black underwear.
61458,"Vaginal discharge is naturally acidic, so it does make those light stains on dark underwear over time."
61459,"And an acidic vagina is a healthy vagina, so make sure you don't overclean and dilute all that good acid!"
61460,It's there to kill bacteria and make sure you don't get any infections)
61461,Dang I’m jealous!
61462,"Stress did the opposite for me, made my cycle go from 21 days to 14."
61463,(Got on the pill which ended that thankfully)
61464,"And don’t forget to count from the day your period starts, not the day it ends."
61465,"It’s not 28 days, then a few days for your period, then 28 again."
61466,The 28 day average includes the period week/days.
61467,My period was late by like 10 days in April or May of 2020… that was so weird for me I became convinced I had gotten pregnant even though my husband (and only partner) had a vasectomy.
61468,But it eventually started and I realized maybe I was more stressed out by the pandemic than I realized.
61469,what about travel or temperature change???
61470,first time i was in an actual snowy winter my cycle was nearly 40 something days!!
61471,!
61472,yup!
61473,"when i moved across the country, i had a 73 day cycle 😳 you can imagine the stress!"
61474,lol
61475,Stress and lifestyle changes.
61476,During uni I didn't have my period for a few months in a row.
61477,"A combination of stress and a healthy, but radically different diet caused it."
61478,"I was worried about talking to people about it because I was worried they would think I was starving myself and lost it due to that, while I was still eating 2000 calories a day."
61479,Went to the doctor who told me it was fine and to wait a little longer.
61480,It came back on the day I handed in my final project for uni and felt less stressed.
61481,"Periods can get weird or go away if you change your lifestyle, like more exercise or new foods, if you're stressed, or even when you have sex for the first time / have more sex or less sex than usual."
61482,"After 5 or 6 months for sure go to the doctor and seek help, but if it's say, 3/4 months, then you're in the range of normal."
61483,">On the topic of cervical mucus or discharge, some people only have a little and some people have a lot!"
61484,"That’s normal too

Don't forget that some women have noticable amounts of discharge every day, and that's completely fine as well!"
61485,As long as it's normal *for you*
61486,I’m going to add in as well.
61487,Let’s talk cramps!
61488,Unfortunately during your period some cramping is normal.
61489,"However, your cramping should never be so bad that it interferes with your daily life, if this is the case you should talk to your GYN."
61490,"Cramps can happen a few days before the start of your period, and around ovulation as well (I know, owning a uterus is not always fun) 

Things you can do to help your cramps;
- Hot water bottle
- A nice PMS tea
- Exercise or yoga (it sounds counterintuitive but it works)
- anti-inflammatory medication (Advil/Midol)
- REST!"
61491,!
61492,Also adding in: a resource.
61493,"[Scarleteen.com](https://Scarleteen.com)

All sorts of good info related to sex ed, written for teens and young adults."
61494,And it's for everyone.
61495,"You should know how the parts basically work, even if you don't have that set of parts."
61496,I was literally in my 30s when I realized that it wasn't a mouse or moth or the machine or soemthing putting holes in them...
61497,I had no clue about that.
61498,>It’s okay for you to have a smell down there!
61499,It’s completely normal.
61500,"Your diet, how much water you drink, what medicines you take, where you are in your cycle, health conditions, and more can affect your smell."
61501,"Coppery, creamy, musky?"
61502,*Normal!
61503,"* 

However - if you notice a smell that's kind of like bread or beer, and you're itchy and irritated down there, that might be a yeast infection."
61504,"If in doubt, ask a doctor!"
61505,"It’s 3-5 tablespoons of blood, but there’s also lots of other stuff too."
61506,"If your period is debilitating, something is not right."
61507,"Some discomfort or even mild pain for a day or two is ok, but it should be solved with a couple doses of regular painkillers."
61508,"If it’s more than that, you need to push for answers."
61509,Birth control is usually the quickest fix.
61510,What is this menorrhagia?!?
61511,I just looked it up and got instantly annoyed.
61512,"My light ""months"" (short cycle) in elementary and junior high were 10 days and I could literally sit on a toilet and just listen to the blood pour out."
61513,Had to cycle through a combo of heavy pads and heavy tampons to get through a school day at the begging of my period.
61514,So my mom took me to the doctor who said it was causing me to be a bit anemic so she had me take an iron supplement every day.
61515,It eventually settled more into normal heavy in high school.
61516,"She never said anything about taking ibuprofen or anything to slow the bleeding, I was someone adverse to pain meds just for pain (took on my mom's fear that any use would decrease its effectiveness if I really needed it later) so I rarely took any despite being curled up in pain the first few days of each period."
61517,"""if it doesn't have a flare, don't put it in there!"""
61518,Write it up!!
61519,I grew up in the Mormon church and therefore heard NONE of this.
61520,My parents refused to answer me when I asked them what sex was and my dad was the one who took me to buy my first tampons.
61521,A lot of girls don’t hear about any of this and sexual health is just as important as physical health.
61522,Share what you know!
61523,Sounds like you need to make a post of your own!
61524,😄👍🏼
61525,"That would be a good idea, ngl."
61526,Safety and education are important for all sexual activity.
61527,This honestly makes me want to write something up about it because sex ed has failed so so many of us honestly.
61528,"I wish I couldn't say this but I've met people who think that eggs, like literal chicken egg size eggs, are what make babies in girls."
61529,Most guys also don't know any parts of a women's reproductive system or where they are if they've heard of them.
61530,The same could be the same for the opposite as well with females not knowing male parts!
61531,And it's no one's fault except the educational system.
61532,"They used scare tactics in my time in school with almost exclusively stds, stis, and biology is why i know more specific anatomy, not sex ed."
61533,It's sad.
61534,Ooh!
61535,"This might be a bit off topic, but for anyone that wants to know more info but in funny format I highly recommend [this webtoon](https://www.webtoons.com/en/slice-of-life/boo-its-sex/list?title_no=1413) it goes into detail in a cute way about a lot of things I wouldn’t have known otherwise ✨"
61536,I wouldn't mind such a post either!
61537,I have been dealing with this since elementary school years (I went through precocious puberty 😩 and am now about 26) and it is HORRIBLE.
61538,"I have to pray I will start on a weekend so I don’t have to miss work due to the pain, diarrhea, and nausea."
61539,Would you mind explaining what your situation was and how they corrected it?
61540,And also did you have to see multiple drs before someone actually wanted to help/could figure it out?
61541,Feel free to DM if you’d like.
61542,"I don’t have many people to talk to about this, let alone that have actually had this kind of pain from their periods."
61543,Endometriosis?
61544,Special kinda hell innit
61545,I honestly can't wait to leave my tiny home town where doctors continually dismiss my period pain with 'it'll get better when you have a baby'.
61546,"I'm never having a baby, and I want you to do something now."
61547,"Lucky after a couple years we found two birthcontrols that help a little bit but I think I'll still bring up other methods of keeping it in check when I get a new doctor, seeing as when I'm off birthcontrol I go right back to throwing up and fainting from the pain."
61548,"Mine were awful, then I had a child and it fixed them somehow?"
61549,It also righted my inverted uterus so it tilts the right way now.
61550,I could never easily use tampons before.
61551,Good thing too because that pregnancy was awful!
61552,"Placenta previa, and he was transverse breech with his head lodged under my rib the entire time."
61553,I was on bed rest forever.
61554,Cramps are starting to come back 13 years later but I think that’s a menopause thing.
61555,"i really feel you, been throwing up and unable to stand, screaming, crying, passing out, it’s not normal but unfortunately a lot of doctors don’t take it seriously"
61556,I would puke each month too.
61557,"Luckily, I learned to take pills after a few years and ibuprofen helped with pain."
61558,Birth control really helped though by making it not so heavy and then as a byproduct not so painful.
61559,This is interesting to me.
61560,I used to have super painful period.
61561,But it was normally in the form of extreme back pain.
61562,Is this something to take note of?
61563,"Ive only ever had pain that made me curl up in a ball once, but I have since gotten the nexplanon implant around last November, and that has fixed my pain."
61564,I guess I’m just wondering whether or not that’s still something to be aware of since it’s been resolved with BC
61565,"Wait, that’s not normal??"
61566,"The adult women in my life have always dismissed it as normal, mostly my mom and foster mom."
61567,I got yelled at after going home from school because I puked.. should’ve just taken a painkiller and kept going
61568,I absolutely *love* her videos.
61569,"I love this woman, so open and informative."
61570,Glad to see you brought her up :)
61571,Ain’t this the fucking truth.
61572,I’m 38 and pretty sure I’m peri-menopausal.
61573,"While I’ve never been completely consistent timing wise, my cycle has always averaged out to 28 days."
61574,"Nope, I’m at like 31 right now and I never know if it’s going to be what I consider “normal” or if it is going to be what I think is my “new normal.”"
61575,I used to have THE WORST cramps.
61576,Then I had a child at 31 and that fixed them somehow?
61577,"They’re starting to get bad again 13 years later, but they’re also getting heavier and more variable so I might be going into menopause."
61578,"I started my period early and so did my mom, and she went into menopause around my current age."
61579,Agreed and thanks for saying so.
61580,I’ll add that it’s also a spectrum.
61581,I’m a lady who thinks periods are gross.
61582,"I’ll get in there and I use a cup so I’m plenty familiar with all those fluids, but yeah, it’s gross."
61583,My husband also thinks that they’re gross.
61584,"Difference is if I needed any sort of period product, he’d get it for me in a second."
61585,"If there was an accident or whatever, he wouldn’t think twice about cleaning it up."
61586,"Just, yknow, body fluids are gross."
61587,I didn’t know that!
61588,Thanks for bringing that up
61589,…that explains so much.
61590,Thanks for telling me sis!
61591,"I've just started taking ADHD meds, thank you!"
61592,"*Puts down her orange juice *

Well this explains that..."
61593,Mind blown!
61594,Thank u!
61595,This explains so much🌷
61596,Adding to this - clots are normal but the average person doesn’t get soooo many.
61597,If you get a lot of clots and a lot of them are relatively large - see your doctor.
61598,I always had clots and thought they were normal - only in my thirties have I been diagnosed with anti phospholipid syndrome - and one of the symptoms?
61599,A lot of clots during your periods.
61600,"And the Germans, of course, have a wonderful word for that strange little pinch or pain when  an egg is released."
61601,It is called mittelschmetz
61602,"To add, there's a more severe form of PMS, that can cause really bad mood swings (hair-trigger anger, to wanting to weep in an hour, for example), and significant changes in your mental state (I would get suicidal a week or two before my period, for example)."
61603,"It's not normal to have such extremes, and you should talk to your doctor."
61604,"Having such symptoms doesn't mean you're broken, or crazy."
61605,You have an issue that needs medical attention.
61606,"You're not alone, either!"
61607,I never knew it was normal to feel an egg released.
61608,"Ahhh my favorite, the dropsies."
61609,"I read somewhere when me menstruating, sensations in fingertips aren’t as sensitive"
61610,it’s the worst.
61611,i’ve been trying to get help because of my pain for years but get dismissed all the time.
61612,on numerous occasions i’ve had to call the hospital because i pass out from the pain but apparently it’s not severe enough for any checkups.
61613,YES!
61614,"There is such a wide range of normal, it’s really change that should be your red flag"
61615,Of course you can add!
61616,Thanks for contributing
61617,Come join us over at r/PMDD
61618,I was scrolling to find the comment about PMDD.
61619,I suffered from it until earlier this year.
61620,"I had two weeks of actual hell - severe depression, anxiety, misphonia (less tolerant of sounds), fatigue, cramps that felt like contractions, insane irritability, etc."
61621,for two full weeks of every month.
61622,My male gyno brushed me off multiple times (I’m not going back to him).
61623,Finally my PCP suggested I take another try at birth control pills.
61624,"I was wary because before I had my son, I was on the pill for years and it caused horrible migraines."
61625,"But I had to try something, 14 days of this misery every month was ruining my life."
61626,"It started to work within 2 months, my symptoms were less severe and only lasted about a week."
61627,Basically what I would call a severe PMS.
61628,"I was getting headaches for 4-5 days during the week after my period, so I suggested to my PCP that I take the pill continuously (go right into the next pack instead of having the sugar pill week) so that I didn’t get my period, therefore, hopefully stopping the headaches."
61629,"I’m now down to one headache a month and while I can’t track it the same way since I have no period to use for timing, I have about 3-4 days where I feel “off”, but nothing even remotely close to PMDD, I’d even say maybe very mild PMS."
61630,"I know the pill doesn’t work for everyone, but my point is DO NOT LET YOUR DOCTORS BRUSH YOU OFF!"
61631,Keep pushing until you find something that works.
61632,"If you’re experiencing severe symptoms leading up to your period, don’t accept that it’s normal."
61633,Keep trying!
61634,"For some people a low dose antidepressant works, taken only during/around ovulation/PMDD."
61635,"I’d also like to add that stress can certainly make PMDD worse, I was in an abusive situation for several years and it was the worst my PMDD ever got."
61636,"After I had him removed from my home, the symptoms weren’t as severe."
61637,Never accept misery and pain as your “normal”.
61638,Auntie checking in!
61639,It really just depends!
61640,Some people get their cycle back right away and some women take a few months.
61641,That’s why it’s *super* important to find a contraceptive that works for you and use it consistently if you don’t want to get pregnant again right away.
61642,The pill and breast feeding can definitely affect when you get your cycle back.
61643,"The pill may cause it to start sooner, usually when you get to the placebo pills at the end of the pack."
61644,And breast feeding can keep your period from coming back for months!
61645,"Some people don’t get their period back until they wean their littles, that happened to me with my 2nd and 3rd kiddos."
61646,I didn’t have a period for over a year with both of them.
61647,"That being said, nursing isn’t a reliable form of contraception because while it can prevent ovulation, you still could!"
61648,"A few things you didn’t ask about but I wish someone had told me about the postpartum period and postpartum bleeding: 

It can be *really* really heavy, they give you those diaper looking pads for a reason."
61649,"Pick up some Depends to sleep in, I promise you’ll thank me later."
61650,Lol.
61651,Postpartum bleeding can also last for a long while.
61652,"I bled for nearly 2 months after my 3rd was born, it can also be surprisingly short."
61653,With my youngest I only bled for about a week!
61654,You might also pass some pretty big clots and that’s okay.
61655,"Gross, but okay."
61656,Anything bigger than a plum you should call your doctor about.
61657,"If you plan to breastfeed, nursing immediately after birth can slow bleeding."
61658,"It can also make you *really* crampy for a few days, holding a pillow over your stomach while you nurse can help."
61659,You’ve got this!
61660,Congrats on the new squish in advance!
61661,<3
61662,"Little off topic but if you’re giving birth soon, be aware you might pass some big chicken liver looking clots after the baby is born, say, in the shower where you look down and say WTF IS THAT but you’re too scared to ask the nurse and it’s 30 years later and you had three more kids."
61663,Maybe just me?
61664,"Hey there, congrats!"
61665,"When your cycle will return is a toss up - I know some folks who got it back within a few months, and some who it took a year+, and there's no telling if it'll go back to ""normal"" length or timing."
61666,You're gonna do great!
61667,Hi!
61668,"Im currently 5 months pp, breastfeeding and I havent seen my period in over a year."
61669,"The other ladies are right that it's a toss up when you start menstruating again,  but it had a lot to do with breastfeeding."
61670,The longer you ebf the longer you'll go without a cycle.
61671,"It can come back while bf, but nursing helps keep it away."
61672,And holy hell yes!
61673,The pill will dry you up... an unfortunate side effect that cut bf with my first short because I had no clue.
61674,Same with decongestants like sudafed.
61675,Read the labels on/ google ANYTHING you take and find a different non hormonal method of bc.
61676,Fellow mom here.
61677,All the others who responded are spot on (ha)... it all varies depending on your body.
61678,"A side note, though: Please pay attention to your thoughts and moods for *several* months after you deliver."
61679,"Once that baby's external, you'll still be full of all the hormones you needed to grow it in the first place."
61680,"Postpartum depression is no joke (and if you're already being treated for depression or anxiety, you might be predisposed to it, as I was)."
61681,Tell someone if you feel... helpless?
61682,Hopeless?
61683,It was a depression I'd never felt before.
61684,"I sat for hours, rocking the baby and sobbing, feeling totally lost."
61685,It happened to me after both of my kids.
61686,"Make sure your partner, or your mom or sister or BFF knows you're hurting, and talk to your doc or midwife or therapist or *somebody* ASAP... there's help out there, so keep an eye on yourself, and ask for help if you need anything."
61687,You can't be there for your baby if you're in pieces.
61688,Wishing you a safe and uncomplicated delivery - You got this!
61689,❤️
61690,"Indeed, I never had a normal cycle, I started my menstrual cycles with a cycle of 2 months worth of spotting and after that only 2 times a year some spotting."
61691,If you don't trust it go to the doctor and make sure he/ she takes you seriously!
61692,Pcos has a lot of health issues that are related and which you might not think about.
61693,"Like anxiety, depression, insulin resistance, mood swings, vitamin d deficiency, hair on strange places, loss of hair, heightened risk of certain cancers and the list goes on."
61694,"It is manageable with the pill and minor life style changes if you experience a lot of symptoms, it will never go away but it is manageable."
61695,And if you do have pcos there some great subs here as well!
61696,Sometimes it helps feeling heard without any judgment and there you can find your safe space
61697,PCOS runs in my family.
61698,Good for you for advocating for your health!
61699,r/pcos for anyone in a similar boat
61700,Thank you for bringing this up.
61701,"You’re right, it needs more attention"
61702,"r/endometriosis

r/endo

Average length of time elapsed from first bringing up endo symptoms with a Dr until receiving an actual diagnosis was 7 years last time I checked"
61703,"yes, sometimes I skip a day especially if something is stressing me."
61704,"As long as your cycle completes, its ok."
61705,"If you're really worried, talk to your obgyn."
61706,Yes.
61707,"My uterus shed erratically, and I would sometimes have a day in the middle where I wouldn’t have any bleeding."
61708,My gynecologist never seemed concerned.
61709,"Yeah, mine does that sometimes and my mum’s did too!"
61710,I wouldn’t worry too much but definitely bring it up with a gyn if you get a check up :)
61711,"Yes, normal."
61712,Annoying and normal.
61713,"Aunt here, this used to happen to me when I was younger."
61714,It really ticked me off at first because I thought my period was over.
61715,😕
61716,i think it can happen!
61717,"sometimes after a period it’s common to have some spotting, but for some it can be more than just spotting, im not 100% on this though so i would recommend getting more opinions"
61718,Normal for me at least 😅 it can happen if I need to wear tampons instead of pads for a day.
61719,"The next day - no period, the day after that it’s back on track again."
61720,"Also if I exercise during the first days after my period, my period can come back (with feelings of cramps as well) and I can bleed for a day or two more."
61721,Great advice!
61722,"It's less common, but aura can also include a heightened sense of smell or phantom smells."
61723,It's not just a visual thing.
61724,Wow thank you I had no idea about this!
61725,Ive been on the combined pill since I was 16 and only recently learned about migraines with aura (although I have had them for many years).
61726,I guess I will be consulting my gp about this
61727,"Hey, not OP but a sister (and nurse)!"
61728,Irregular periods aren’t necessarily a big issue for you now but could be if you ever decide to have babies.
61729,"They could be for a number of reasons; maybe hormonal issues such as PCOS, you might not be getting adequate nutrition or if you’re very active, or even a symptom of a thyroid condition to name a few common reasons."
61730,It’s worth seeing a doctor to figure out what’s going on earlier rather than later if you can.
61731,Those cramps do seem worse than ‘normal’ and would also be worth mentioning.
61732,"There’s medication that’s more effective than tylenol, but it’s also good to know WHY you’re getting such painful cramps."
61733,There’s definitely things that can be done about both irregular and painful periods.
61734,Make sure you use double protection especially with irregular periods (condom + birth control).
61735,Its normal for periods sometimes be super painful and sometimes just fine.
61736,If it starts always being super painful please see your obgyn to make sure nothing is wrong.
61737,Hi!
61738,I'm older and done with my periods.
61739,But I wanted to chime I and say the only regular thing about my periods were how irregular they were.
61740,A few years after I started menstruating I went on the pill and that helped make them regular.
61741,I'm not familiar with all the new options so there might be something better to try.
61742,But the pill was the only thing that kept me regular.
61743,"Any time I went off of it, within a month or two it was all over the place again."
61744,Regularly irregular is normal for some people.
61745,But good to check in with a Dr to make sure it's just your normal.
61746,"My cramps made me pass out when I was a teenager, and kept me in bed as an adult."
61747,Unfortunately those were normal for me.
61748,Using the pill cut the duration of my cramps but not the severity.
61749,I eventually moved to a pill where I only had a period 4 times a year.
61750,Then my family planned things around those days bc we knew I'd be miserable and in bed.
61751,But you do need to visit a Dr to make sure there isn't an issue or something they can help aliveate.
61752,Since I'm ancient I've had a lot of gyn drs over my lifetime.
61753,"I have no issues with a male doctor, but if I was feeling anxious or nervous, seeing a male doctor knocked that up a level."
61754,"There will be female Dr's who aren't compassionate, but I was always most comfortable with a female Dr. You can ask to speak with them and discuss your concerns before setting up an appointment."
61755,It's a very personal thing to find a Dr you trust.
61756,Don't hesitate to leave messages asking to speak to a few different ones before choosing.
61757,Sometimes a recommendation from a friend is helpful.
61758,And always discuss your concerns.
61759,Explain its your first time and you are feeling nervous about it.
61760,"It's never fun, but it shouldn't  be so scary that it makes you avoid it."
61761,"I'd start with asking someone that you trust, in your area for a Dr recommendation."
61762,It doesn't have to be someone your age.
61763,I don’t think irregular periods are inherently a cause for concern.
61764,Especially since it sounds like yours aren’t supremely irregular (like every few months and last for weeks - my poor friend has this).
61765,How do you feel during your period?
61766,Generally ok?
61767,Need some chocolate and ibuprofen or are you suffering and miserable?
61768,"Regardless, I think it would be a very good idea to schedule an appointment with an OBGYN."
61769,"You don’t need to have a full exam, just go and meet someone to talk about your body."
61770,They can give you guidance and good information about what you need and can even get you on birth control if you want it.
61771,Yes!
61772,Thank you for mentioning this
61773,I’m glad you feel included.
61774,"Wow, I’d never heard of that!"
61775,Thanks for bringing it up
61776,I’ve known a few girls who have started Estrogen and they described the same thing - basically everything but the actual bleeding.
61777,It can be difficult!
61778,"Luckily the same things work: anti-inflammatories, hot water bottles, ginger or peppermint tea and being nice to yourself."
61779,I always thought it was a bit rude that they were opting to take estrogen and it was still being like this to them!
61780,"So, welcome to the period club!"
61781,Mine neither and her trashy boyfriend shamed me when mine started.
61782,I can't upvote this enough.
61783,I'm definitely more...
61784,frenetic?...
61785,at specific points in my cycle.
61786,Talk to your doctor about it and they can help you figure out how best to navigate ADHD during your period (or your period while having ADHD).
61787,No.
61788,Sex before your period is actually during your most fertile so you will be more likely to get pregnant.
61789,You can also get pregnant during your period as well.
61790,"Nope darlin, sex just before your period begins is just as likely to get a person pregnant."
61791,I've heard good things about vaginal boric acid suppositories for kicking BV out.
61792,Have you tried that option?
61793,"Lots of pregnancies do miscarry, as many as one in five IIRC."
61794,Sad and terrible when it happens but is definitely part of the whole cycle of pregnancy and birth for a whole lot of people.
61795,"If you aren’t 100% sure when you ovulate, don’t assume you aren’t fertile."
61796,Err on the side of caution.
61797,"You cannot get pregnant after the egg has died but if you don’t know when you ovulated, you don’t know if the egg is dead."
61798,Best to assume you can always get pregnant.
61799,Use Gillette Good News razors.
61800,Or maybe buy an actual razor.
61801,"I had razor bumps for a while, sometimes so bad it looked like a rash."
61802,Sometimes a few big red ones.
61803,"Itchy, painful, unsightly."
61804,Shudder.
61805,Then a guy friend said to me to use those razors.
61806,That was many years  ago.
61807,"I also started buying those hypoallergenic shave creams, they’re common, can get them at Target and wherever."
61808,Total life changer.
61809,"Haven’t had those bumps since then, for like more than ten years, I always use those razors haha but I avoid the Gillette Good News razor with the the aloe strip."
61810,"Seems like it would be helpful, but doesn’t actually give as good of shave."
61811,What are you using to lubricate the razor as you use it?
61812,Cream?
61813,"Yes, it can really take it out of you."
61814,Being on your period also uses a bit more energy than normal and can leave you feeling tired.
61815,Always assume a gun is loaded and a uterus is fertile.
61816,Words to live by.
61817,;)
61818,Yes.
61819,Progesterone can make you more interested in sex.
61820,"It’s such a simple explanation, it kills me that we don’t cover this sort of thing in regular sex education."
61821,Don't wear tampons the first few days of your cycle.
61822,"Warm baths/heating pads

Exercise

Masturbation/ sex

Ibuprofen

If they are debilitating, see a doctor that takes you seriously."
61823,"Also, menstrual migraines are a thing and totally treatable in most cases"
61824,Try getting ahead of your cramps.
61825,"If you know you tend to get cramps, take an ibuprofen as soon as you see blood."
61826,"If you have really bad cramps, talk to your doctor (OB/GYN), and keep talking to them, and maybe get another doctor and talk to them, until somebody takes you seriously."
61827,"Conditions like endometriosis and fibroids can cause severe cramping, and they don't get diagnosed nearly as often as they should because pain associated with menstruation gets waved away and disregarded."
61828,"You can switch to a cup, if I have cramps I find if I rinse my cup with warm water before I insert it the cup itself stays warm."
61829,It’s very soothing.
61830,"(I am not suggesting putting warm water inside, just a menstrual cup that has been warmed using water)"
61831,Painkillers and muscle spasm suppresants are amazing.
61832,"It is not unhealthy, that’s a myth."
61833,"When the birth control pill was developed, the drug companies feared people wouldn’t use it if there were no periods because it would be too unnatural."
61834,This [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/no-periods/403894/) gives a good explanation.
61835,Ah yes.
61836,"The clots, thank you for mentioning them."
61837,"Interestingly, a person who tends to have above average estrogen levels may feel more aroused during the luteal phase because their progesterone levels are high enough to make their estrogen levels feel normal."
61838,It’s really amazing how much we can learn about our overall health by tracking how we feel throughout our cycle.
61839,Glad to hear you solved your personal mystery.
61840,Thank you for normalizing this information.
61841,I’m glad you figured out the pattern and were able to fix it.
61842,"I WAS SEARCHING FOR THIS AS WELL, THANKS!!"
61843,Since your lower body is contracting to release the period blood etc.
61844,"out of the uterus, your bowels can (and will in most cases) be affected by this as well."
61845,This means fun period shits on one of the first days!
61846,"It might be frustrating, but there's nothing you can really do about it - apart from the pain of course :) Wipe gently and from front to back ducklings!"
61847,Sorry!
61848,What I mean is that 28 days is average across a large number of people.
61849,"Lots of people assume their periods will be exactly 28 days, but that’s not the case."
61850,Make more sense now?
61851,"Goofpuff is right, but also *do not be worried about asking your doctor/GYN*."
61852,A good doctor/GYN will be more than happy to talk through something you're not sure about and either look into it or put your mind at ease.
61853,"Where I used to live, I had a family doctor and a GYN."
61854,I once noticed a bump in my breast in the shower.
61855,"I was in my mid 20s, and I mildly panicked because that is drilled into minds - lumps need to be seen ASAP."
61856,My family doctor dismissed it over the phone.
61857,Told me to call the GYN because it might have to do with my IUD.
61858,I still don't comprehend that.
61859,I called the GYN though - they fit me in that afternoon.
61860,"The doc talked me through it totally calmly, said I had done the right thing in asking, ultimately determined it was ok. (Likely an angry lymph node.)"
61861,I didn't advocate for myself well then.
61862,"Now if my family doc blew me off like that, I would immediately be looking for a new practioner."
61863,"MamaDoctorJones, which I suggested in another comment, literally just did a video encouraging teens (but applicable to anyone) not to be shy about asking their doc anything that concerns them."
61864,Here's that video: https://youtu.be/VU-otWoiaJw
61865,Stress or even getting sick can affect your period cycle by delaying it.
61866,"And then after you get your period, your dates will be different as the cycle doesn't follow a calendar date."
61867,Did it change and then stay at the new date?
61868,You body may have dealt with a stressor and just bumped up hormonal reactions.
61869,"It happened to me recently as well, I was two weeks early and it was very strange."
61870,"In addition to stress and illness, remember that all of this is hormone driven."
61871,Your cycle will change as you age because your hormones change as you age.
61872,Weight gain/loss can impact hormones.
61873,"So can diet, stress, sleep, and a million other things."
61874,I learned a lot about my cycle when I was trying to get pregnant.
61875,I remember reading through the book and thinking: WHY was this information not given to me in the beginning?!?!
61876,?
61877,That definitely can be an issue.
61878,"For people experiencing infertility causes by too little progesterone, going soy free can help."
61879,"When I figure out peri menopause, I’ll write one 😆 

I’m going on year 5 of it and no end in sight"
61880,Yes please!
61881,Yes BUT…and this is a great big huge but…it’s hard for a lot of people to be absolutely 100% sure when they ovulate.
61882,"If you have the levels of estrogen and progesterone you’re ideally supposed to have, you can track your daily temperature immediately upon waking and see a minimum 0.2 degree rise in temperature that is sustained during your entire luteal phase."
61883,"If your cervix is where you can reach it, you can confirm that it has changed shape to become high, firm and closed."
61884,"3 full days post ovulation (IF you can definitively know you ovulated) with 3 days is sustained higher temps, sustained high/closed/firm cervix, and no cervical mucous, you are outside of your fertility window."
61885,I do not recommend relying on this if a surprise pregnancy would be a problem for you because a lot of people don’t have textbook obvious symptoms that are easy to track.
61886,But I’m not going to give you inaccurate information to scare you into taking precautions either.
61887,"So there's this joke that goes, ""What do we call people who practice 'The Rhythm Method?'"
61888,"(Method of birth control based on abstaining from intercourse on your most fertile days) ""Parents!"""
61889,In truth I used the Rhythm Method for years bc hormonal birth control just didn't mesh well with me.
61890,I got six years out of it lol then got pregnant.
61891,"Then just had my ""tubes tied"" and husband got a vasectomy."
61892,This was true for me!
61893,"My period was late around the time of my Covid shots, and it freaked me out lol I was worried about possibly being pregnant"
61894,This is amazing lol
61895,That must have been so stressful.
61896,I don’t know why we gatekeep this information.
61897,Soaking anything with a bloodstain in water with a little hydrogen peroxide will quickly treat the stain before you wash it.
61898,Agreed.
61899,And effectively tracking your cycles is not just paying attention to when you have your period.
61900,"Here’s the thing kiddos, I’ve used natural family planning for 21 years with only intended pregnancies BUT (1) that means I take and track my temperature every.single.morning."
61901,It’s my snooze alarm activity.
61902,(2) I look at the toilet paper every morning and track what I see.
61903,(3) I examine my cervix daily from the day my period ends until at least 3 days after ovulation to confirm ovulation.
61904,Bottom line: it’s not low maintenance and it’s not fool proof.
61905,"If I were not completely prepare to have unexpected pregnancy, I would not rely on it."
61906,I get so anxious when I see people say that their app tells me they’re not going to ovulate for another X days but they’re not tracking symptoms.
61907,Those apps assume your luteal phase is 14 days so they average the length of your cycle and subtract 14 days.
61908,They are NOT accurate.
61909,Your luteal phase could be much shorter and those apps would have you having sex at all the wrong times.
61910,When the ovaries run low on eggs to send to the womb and a negative hormone production causes a chemical imbalance in a female and can and often does cause a depression.
61911,"Thanks for adding, I didn’t know that"
61912,"Until I had my second pregnancy, my periods were short and heavy."
61913,I always wore a pad and a tampon because I needed the back up.
61914,"It can be, yes."
61915,The hormone shifts that mark each phase can totally impact your energy level.
61916,Did they check you for fibroids?
61917,I don’t know the answer to that one.
61918,I know some women stop bleeding for a day and then start again.
61919,Do you think maybe it’s a coincidence and not a causal connection?
61920,Auntie here!
61921,Do you mean masturbation when you write self stimulate?
61922,"If it is, yes that’s normal."
61923,"When you orgasm and stimulates your down region, you can kinda activate the cramps again or just helping your body getting rid of the “afterflow”/spotting you otherwise would have, but it comes out all in one go instead of the slow speed it would have come out in otherwise."
61924,"I think it’s because your natural lubricant that goes waaay in is active and well, lubricate."
61925,"Also, when we are aroused we swell and stretch down there, so I think both the stretching bit and the part when we de-stretch is helping getting rid of all the things that would have become spotting otherwise."
61926,"I’m not sure if it is so, but it make sense to me and even if it’s not because of that, I have experienced the same thing as you."
61927,Please don’t be ashamed.
61928,You need to make an appointment with a gynecologist ASAP to rule out anything serious.
61929,Are you cramping?
61930,Is the only at a particular point in your cycle?
61931,Or all the time?
61932,I learned all this information when I was trying to get pregnant.
61933,I started with the book Taking Charge of Your Fertility and I got so angry that I was never given this information.
61934,"Once I knew what to look for, I could easily and accurately predict my periods."
61935,I could have saved myself so much embarrassment if someone had just told me.
61936,It’s wrong to gatekeep this information from teen AFAB people.
61937,It’s not normal and you don’t have to tolerate it.
61938,Are you on hormonal birth control?
61939,Is that an option for you?
61940,How old are you?
61941,How old are you?
61942,Are you underweight?
61943,When was your last period and when did you last have sex?
61944,What does it mean when people mention that they “stop having” them entirely?
61945,The entire cycle is paused?
61946,It is not.
61947,You do not need to have periods to be healthy.
61948,"Riding a bike, horse, playing sports, being active... 
Also cups and discs!"
61949,Check out the subreddits for those if curious.
61950,I am 37 and have been using a cup for only a few months... Amazing!
61951,Between my cup and period underwear I don't use any throwaway products anymore.
61952,"Also - sex shouldn’t hurt, not even the first time even if you bleed."
61953,"When we get aroused, we women get a boner as well!"
61954,It’s just that we get wider and deeper and get more natural lubricant.
61955,So if it hurts you probably need more foreplay.
61956,AND!!!
61957,Your body can get aroused even if you are not!
61958,With physical stimuli your body is going to respond physically.
61959,"if something bad has happened to you sexually, and you got wet or even got an orgasm, that doesn’t mean you wanted to have sex!"
61960,It’s no “maybe I secretly wanted this”.
61961,"It’s no “maybe it wasn’t so bad after all, otherwise I wouldn’t have got wet/orgasm”."
61962,"If someone tickles you on your nose with a feather against your will and you sneeze, it doesn’t mean your will doesn’t matter anymore."
61963,It doesn’t make it less serious or somehow your fault.
61964,It means that somebody did something against your will and your body got an physical reaction to a certain type of physical stimuli.
61965,"If you didn’t want it, what happened to you was WRONG, no matter how your body responded."
61966,It’s NOT your fault ❤️
61967,"I'm gonna have to Google this, I'm not familiar with discs."
61968,I tried a cup but it was uncomfortable and removal was kind of a challenge.
61969,I HATE wearing pads but tampons are uncomfortable for me too so it's my only option.
61970,But it's so wasteful 😩
61971,Your body will feel better without those chemicals too!
61972,I have less bloating and cramping these days.
61973,I’ll never go back to using disposable products and the chemicals in them!
61974,Right!
61975,They're amazing!
61976,"I have a tilted uterus as well as uterine prolapse and I cant wear a cup with suction, but the discs are a GODSEND!"
61977,"Also, I fully endorse Victoria's secret period panties."
61978,100%
61979,Same here!
61980,I am so happy to have them.
61981,"I always take the tampon in one hand and the string in the other and pull it a couple of times, just to make sure the string is securely attached."
61982,I recommend it especially with cheaper brands!
61983,"Also, if you have a history of migraines with aura (lights) and you’re looking into birth control, mention it to your doctor."
61984,Having migraine with aura and taking the regular pill in grades your chance of a stroke.
61985,You can take the mini pill (progesterone only).
61986,"You do have to take it at the same time every day, but it’s a tiny pill and pretty easy to just carry with you so you don’t forget / didn’t accidentally leave it at home or something."
61987,"Oh yeah, ty, forgot about those points."
61988,Birth control helped my sisters a ton with thwir awful periods.
61989,"And I had anemia from it, good to keep on top of that as well."
61990,Is it weird for the light stains to have a rusty color to them?
61991,I remember figuring this out and being so mad that I got even fewer days without bleeding than I thought!
61992,"I earned a scholarship to study abroad when I was in highschool (10+ years ago)

When my host mom did my laundry, she pulled me aside and told me that she wasn’t doing my laundry anymore bc of the way my panties looked."
61993,"She said that nobody had anything like that coming out of them, and that it was disgusting."
61994,"When you move in with a host family, you go over a “contract” so there aren’t any weird hangup, like you would with roommates."
61995,During that they had insisted on them doing laundry.
61996,"After this convo i apologized and asked to take over my laundry, they denied me."
61997,"In a chain of awful events, this one fucked me up a *lot*."
61998,"Esp coming from the mom, A WOMAN."
61999,"My own mother is a nurse, i felt so confused and disgusted, bc why hadnt she said anything to me if i was defunct??"
62000,"Im almost 30 and literally everytime i go to the bathroom and see my panties i feel confused, shameful."
62001,"If more women knew this before this kind of bullshit was impressed on them, i think they would be able to overcome it."
62002,"Even tho i know its just how some bodies work, i still think about that moment way more than i should

Sorry to dump that, but what you said really resonates, and i know im not alone in these thoughts"
62003,"And if that’s not enough, a doctor can help."
62004,I had to start birth control at 15 because my cycles were messed up and my cramps were so bad.
62005,"That was 30 years ago and I know there are bc methods with less side effects now, like a hormonal iud or any of the shots or patches that I don’t know anything about."
62006,There are many ways to deal with unusually strong cramps that aren’t strong prescription painkillers.
62007,I'd like to add something to your wonderful list - my mom and I recently discovered that the Tens unit my parents have used for their back pain works a treat!
62008,"It's heaven sent, especially on days with back cramps."
62009,It makes the cramps shorter and far less excruciating to deal with.
62010,"Adding to this, you shouldn't be suffering during your period!"
62011,"of course it can suck, but if cramps are interfering with your life definitely talk to a doctor."
62012,I used to have periods where I was stuck in a fetal position if I wasn't throwing up.
62013,"Once I started birth control, my quality of life significantly improved"
62014,"I want to emphasize that while period crams are normal, it doesn't mean it's something you ""just need to get used to""."
62015,"It's perfectly fine to take painkillers if you need, it's perfectly fine to ask your doctor for something stronger if basic stuff doesn't work, it's perfectly fine to ask for a method of contraception that will help with the pain or even stop your periods whatsoever, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
62016,You *do not* need to suffer every month.
62017,"Also, it's actually ok to take the painkillers *before* you start cramping, when you know you're on your period and you usually get cramps."
62018,Don't feel guilty for taking pain meds.
62019,"If your pain is unbearable, you can go to ER and they should give you an IV with something stronger."
62020,"And if your pain is that bad, get checked by a gynecologist."
62021,You might have some underlying issues that require treatment.
62022,I've always had painful periods.
62023,"Hormonal BC helped, but I didn't want to spend the money when I don't need BC."
62024,"Injection BC stopped my period and it was amazing, but I started putting on weight so I stopped getting them."
62025,"For me, the best thing is ketoprofen (painkiller), and drotaverine (stops muscle spasms) combo."
62026,"I can see now that they're not available everywhere (I live in Central Europe), but I recommend to try them if they're available where you live."
62027,"Other things that help is heat (like a hot water bottle on your abdomen, but not too hot!"
62028,"), and standing upright!"
62029,Apparently the cramps get worse when you're lying down because the uterus has to work harder against the gravity (although it's anecdotal and I'm not sure if true for everyone).
62030,"Again, **you don't need to suffer through the pain**."
62031,"If your pain is unbearable, you can go to ER"
62032,My nurse practitioner suggested I start taking Aleve at the first smallest sign of my period.
62033,Iirc she said it blocks something that causes cramping.
62034,It was a game changer for me.
62035,I took two at the first sign and then 1 every 12 hours for the two days after.
62036,It was such a big difference and such a relief.
62037,Just want to add that raspberry leafs tea is reaaaally good both for reducing period cramp pains and also “soften the edges” around PMS and PMS blues as well!
62038,"Around a tablespoon of raspberry leafs in hot (precisely starting boiling) water, let it sit for 10 minutes (I usually put some other tea in it as well cause it can be a tiny bit bitter) and drink one or two cups every day the week before your period."
62039,"It has been a game changer for me, and I hope it can help you as well 🌷 love, auntie"
62040,"A little more info: when practicing yoga, traditionally women do not do inverted positions during menstruation."
62041,"Telling a teacher, “I am on my moon time” will let them know to help you to adjust your practice."
62042,"I’ve noticed I’ve had some super minor cramping that happens weeks after my period, and I had made a note to talk to my doctor about it at my next physical."
62043,Reading this thread has me betting if I track it the next time it’s probably aligning with ovulation.
62044,"(But as good advice, it’s still a good idea to mention three things to your doctor!"
62045,"I mentioned to my GP that my armpits get really sensitive and sometimes sore, which worried me because of the lymph nodes there,  and she asked if I noticed it during my period, and sure enough, it was just a symptom of PMS)"
62046,Also magnesium can help with menstrual cramps.
62047,I used scarleteen when I was a teenager in the 90s - so grateful to hear such a great resource is still there 😁
62048,"Yea... so annoying, though."
62049,Oh.....that make sense.
62050,Wait I think this comment is somehow jumbled up on the thread.
62051,Are you talking about holes in the underwear?
62052,Is that not from the washing machine?
62053,?
62054,"if it doesn't have a base, it'll be gone without a trace"
62055,Can we please start a sex Ed related thread?
62056,"I’m in no state to do it rn, but would love to add to it."
62057,Thanks for that!
62058,I just read all 98 of them.
62059,"Weirdly, it answered a question I got asked literally last night."
62060,"I'm not the commenter above, but I've had similar experiences."
62061,"Vomiting, convulsions, passing out...yeah."
62062,"Serious business, every month."
62063,"Hormonal birth control was hit-or-miss for me, and eventually it started to give me migraines that turned out to be the ""you're going to have a stroke if you keep taking this medicine"" kind."
62064,"I got an IUD after I had a kid, and it's been pretty good."
62065,"It's a hormonal version, but it doesn't send the hormones into the bloodstream, it just puts them straight in the uterus, so it's not a risk for me."
62066,Much lighter cycles.
62067,"4 years in, and I've only just gotten to the point where I'll occasionally pop a couple ibuprofen here and there."
62068,"It did make my cycles *completely* unpredictable, though, which is not common, from what I understand, but can happen."
62069,"I’m not the above commenter either but I did eventually manage it with birth control pills around 14 or 15, after almost 6 years of barfing and lying on the bathroom floor every period."
62070,"I know it’s bad to discriminate based on gender, but I find female drs are more likely to try anything to help (*in my personal experience*)."
62071,"When I had a male dr he tried one pill, it gave me side effects and didn’t help a lot with pain, then he shrugged and said “well, we tried."
62072,Here’s a prescription for Naproxen and get a hot water bottle.” Naproxen wasn’t available over the counter yet at the time.
62073,"Switched drs to a female dr who thought his choice of birth control pill was weird bc the hormones in it don’t usually help with strong periods, and tried like 6 different ones until we found what worked."
62074,If I had even a hint of a side effect she switched me immediately.
62075,Then I moved and had to get a new dr and he questioned why I was on birth control so young when I said I wasn’t sexually active during my history.
62076,"I was 18 by then abd had been on it for a few years, and I don’t think 18 is exactly young for birth control."
62077,When I said it was for period pain he said I will mess up my body and instead have me a prescription for a very strong painkiller.
62078,"I didn’t really know any better, but it concerned my mom when I told her, and she helped me find a new dr that put me back on the pill that had been working."
62079,It did not cause fertility issues like the one dr said it would.
62080,I got pregnant with my son a couple weeks after we started trying.
62081,"No worries hun xx
Mine ended up being quite serious, menorrhagia and endometriosis don't mix well!"
62082,It turns out that those things ran in my family and no one thought it was important to tell me until I was hospitalised for the fourth time!
62083,"Normal birth control didn't work and in the end I was begging them to just rip everything out, but the docs were horrible about it!"
62084,I ended up getting recommended something called a mirena coil which...
62085,Didn't do much.
62086,So I changed doctor because I was at the end of my tethers.
62087,"Being 28 as i am now, noone wanted to help much because 'what if your husband wants children?'"
62088,(this was ongoing since I was 18!)
62089,And she was amazing.
62090,"Within two years (covod happened and another doctor tried to intervene) od had a procedure called an Ablation done, with a new coil fitted after too."
62091,I've not had a period since as that ablation removes all the extra lining and the coils hormones FINALLY stopped the growth of extra lining too.
62092,"It was scary because every single person except one doctor and the surgeon was determined to scare me away (even when I was hospitalised, I had this horrid last doctor who tried to tell me an ablation would make it worse, was only temporary blah blah, it's NOT! )"
62093,and I only managed it with those two.
62094,"I was so close to just giving up and dealing with it but hun, it's been life changing not having that pain."
62095,"I don't know where you are, but if you need any advice or want help finding folks who can look at your pain and help you, just let me know xx"
62096,You might wanna check out r/endometriosis or r/endo
62097,I had cramps that put my in the hospital.
62098,The only thing that helped was taking a naproxen sodium (aka Aleve) before the pain got too bad and made me throw it up.
62099,Oral bc didn’t help.
62100,Hormonal IUDs were life-changing.
62101,"I don’t have any periods, no cramps, no mood swings, no ridiculous weight gain."
62102,It’s the best.
62103,"I’ve had the Skyla and Mirena, both worked great."
62104,"Side-effect is the efficacy as a birth control is equivalent of sterilization, but totally reversible."
62105,Definitely a special kind of hell.
62106,Prod them about an ablation if you can!
62107,Especially if you're child free.
62108,"If you're like me and younger than 40,you may need to blag it and just say you (and potential hubs/wife/anything to make the doc happy) Are considering adoption."
62109,I had that plus a mirena coil fitted and I've never been so happy before
62110,"I got the same “advise”, had a baby and it was exactly the same after."
62111,Those doctors don’t care and are repeating myths instead of dispensing medical care.
62112,Never be afraid to change doctor!
62113,It took me... Oif I think 8 different doctors?
62114,About ten years of fighting and by then it was close to unaliving me with how bad it was making literally everything.
62115,I'm unable to have children with the damage its done!
62116,"Tell them that) if it's not a family doctor( this stuff runs in the family, you want to know for an ablation and possibly a coil."
62117,"It may be just a coil would help you, it's helped a lot of folks but if not, ask a bout the other."
62118,"Just be warned though hun, ablation won't let you have littles, it removes all the lining so nothing can grow, although doctors do have to explain all that too so they should do a better job of explaining than me x"
62119,"Yes x birth control can help, but keep an eye just in case!"
62120,"If it ever stops or gets worse, make sure you see someone x"
62121,"You should still mention it to your gyn

Birth control is treating a symptom, but you wanna make sure there's not an underlying cause being masked"
62122,Good grief no it's not!!!!
62123,Honey if you get the chance get it looked at.
62124,"I will bet my cat that somewhere in your family is either endometriosis or mennoragia, both or (there's another and I've forgotten the english word for it)

You should NEVER be in pain."
62125,People only think that because back in the waylongago people thought it was religious retribution for an apple.
62126,"Until then, hot water bottle, codeine if you can take it or one paracetamol and the one ibuprofen (trick my doc told me), lie down and REST

DON'T do anything when your hurting like that, if it's not normal for other people it shouldn't be normal for you!"
62127,((Hugs)) friend.
62128,For a couple of years mine went from a steady 28 day cycle to between 21-24 days.
62129,This was still manageable.
62130,My doc described it as my body trying to use all the eggs as quickly as possible.
62131,Then I went 10 months with nothing.
62132,SO CLOSE ( has to be 12 months to be considered fully in menopause).
62133,"In month 10 I started again and had it for 4 weeks, mostly super light."
62134,"Then 2 weeks off, now I am on week 6."
62135,Yes I’ve spoken with my doc.
62136,Really hope this is the last gasp.
62137,"Once you hit menopause for real, if you get any bleeding, see your doc immediately."
62138,Apparently that is a cancer symptom.
62139,"I have also found this book helpful:  

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55272232"
62140,"By “think it’s gross” he means have an active unnecessary aversion and disgust to any mention of the existence of menstruation, not having a normal human reaction to body fluid."
62141,No one’s saying you need to fingerpaint with your period blood lmfao
62142,Of course!!
62143,"Just another way neurodivergent women get fucked 🤣🤣🤣🤣 But thinking about it, neurotypical women might face the same problems with focus during those times as well."
62144,I can’t remember exactly but it’s something about how the progesterone and estrogen interferes with the production of dopamine.
62145,"Hmm, now I’m curious, but I also don’t feel like getting stuck down a rabbit hole just to look up and it to somehow be 5pm 🤣"
62146,Anytime!
62147,I would also recommend r/adhdwomen and r/twoxadhd if you aren’t in those subs.
62148,"They are wonderful and this kind of shit gets discussed quite a bit, lol."
62149,And they are light years better than the dumpster fire that is r/adhd.
62150,My meds not working during my period is actually how I realized my meds were working the rest of the time 🤣
62151,You’re welcome!
62152,I highly recommend r/adhdwomen and r/twoxadhd.
62153,"They are great subs (and inclusive of all women, including those AMAB)!"
62154,"However, r/adhd is a raging dumpster fire of bullshit."
62155,For funny go to r/adhdmeme.
62156,For funny and helpful and relatable r/adhdinos and r/adhdalien.
62157,There is also r/adhd_lpt
62158,You’re welcome!
62159,You can find more info like this over on r/adhdwomen and r/twoxadhd
62160,[removed]
62161,Sometimes my clots are the size of my fist (usually a bit smaller).
62162,Is this normal?
62163,I had no idea that was a symptom of APS.
62164,I’m mid 30s and because of abnormal labs indicating APS / undifferentiated connective tissue disease put on low dose aspirin.
62165,Thank you for mentioning this!
62166,My mother once furnished a doctor's note citing this to a particularly nosy teacher in the 60s.
62167,"Mittelschmerz, pronounced *mit-tel-shmairts*."
62168,"Means pain-in-the-middle, because it's in the middle of your cycle."
62169,r
62170,Mine makes me suicidal as well.
62171,I felt so crazy until I connected it to my period.
62172,"Not everyone does, but if you do feel it, it doesn’t mean something is wrong."
62173,I hated them!
62174,What a silly symptom!
62175,"Of course, now I'm bitching about menopause..."
62176,You might wanna visit r/endometriosis or r/endo
62177,"The male doctor I had as a teen dismissed my cramps, even though I was missing class over it."
62178,The female nurse at school didn't say shit about hours long cramps not being normal.
62179,"It wasn't until I looked up why my cramps were so bad, realized it aligned with Endo, went to a male gynecologist (I was in college at that point, and better able to advocate for myself) who listened, and we did a laparoscopic procedure to check for and attempt to resolve my Endo."
62180,"(fun fact: while it helped, I had a bisalp yesterday, about 10 years later, and the new doctor found Endo again."
62181,"So even tho I can't get pregnant, I'll still be on some form of birth control to control the Endo)."
62182,"I mention their genders because I have the impression other people typically have women listen better, but that wasn't the case for me."
62183,It just takes a good doctor.
62184,It sucks that we get dismissed so often.
62185,Many people think it's just something we need to get used to and we have to suffer through the pain.
62186,We don't.
62187,Joined!
62188,Thank you!
62189,r/PMDD fam unite.
62190,I was looking for this and glad someone mentioned it.
62191,I thought something was EXTREMELY wrong with me or that I was bipolar until I learned about PMDD and ways to manage it.
62192,"For those unfamiliar, PMDD is extreme mood swings (usually) the week before your period."
62193,I describe it as PMS on steroids.
62194,"For me, I essentially feel like a different person that's depressed and has zero confidence when the rest of the month I'm a pretty upbeat and possibly excessively confident person."
62195,"During my teenage years, I wanted to not be alive anymore the week before my period started."
62196,I also get pretty extreme rage over things that normally wouldn't bother me.
62197,"If this sounds like you, check out the sub, see if the symptoms apply, and seek help!"
62198,The folks over at r/PMDD are super supportive and one of the most accepting subreddits I've encountered.
62199,I definitely need to have a conversation with my doc.
62200,Thanks auntie!
62201,"This is really helpful, I’ll admit I only found out about post natal bleeding after I got pregnant 😂, it’s not like it would have made me choose not to get pregnant but as someone who hates their period it was a real bummer to find out I’ll be bleeding very heavily for possibly weeks."
62202,Everyone in the mums groups seems to talk about it like it’s common knowledge and I just had no idea!
62203,I’m sorry… did you say a PLUM???
62204,?
62205,"Nicely put, Auntie!"
62206,I just wanted to add that every body is different when it comes to nursing and their menstrual cycle.
62207,"I had heard that after the postpartum bleeding stopped that as long as I nursed, I probably wouldn't get my period."
62208,I was stoked!
62209,I have PMDD so the excitement was real.
62210,I ended up going back to my normal menstrual cycle about two months after giving birth and it stayed regular the entire year I nursed.
62211,I feel like I could have written this.
62212,PCOS is no joke.
62213,I didn't know vitamin D deficiency was related to PCOS!
62214,"I've been taking vit D all year round for years now, and what used to be almost crippling Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD - lower levels of light in winter make you depressed) is now a lot less problematic."
62215,"Also, since I've been walking my dog in the middle of the day and getting a lot more sunlight on my arms and legs, I'm more cheerful."
62216,"I suggest having your vit D checked if you have SAD, and if it's low, start taking it all year round - it takes a long time to build up vitamin D levels."
62217,"I was lucky, diagnosed within about a year when I was 18."
62218,I want others to have a similar experience.
62219,thank you <3
62220,Thank you!
62221,Didn’t know that - but it explains why sometimes I think I catch a whiff of cigarette smoke when I get them lol.
62222,"Not to give too, too much information, but I have had terrible experiences related to men freaking out regarding the color of my blood!"
62223,I feel like general education regarding female menstruation is important.
62224,Thank you for your post.
62225,"Yeah I think I'm on it now, I have heartburn so bad I feel like I'm going to throw up, I haven't been sleeping the last couple nights because I'm so warm even in the ac and with a fan."
62226,It could be something else but maybe not
62227,I still have the paragard IUD so that's my birth control.
62228,I always just thought that the way the uterus sloughs off an egg would have to go with it!
62229,The body is amazing.
62230,"I have tried boric acid, though not in a few years."
62231,"I have this terrible tasting medication that I'm supposed to take for 2 weeks for suppression therapy, then 6 months of bi-weekly vaginal gel treatments."
62232,We'll see if that kicks it.
62233,Thank you :)
62234,"Cream while shaving go with the hair to trim, then recreate and back up."
62235,I moisturize after.
62236,I keep getting conflicting answers on this.
62237,At this point I’m contemplating waxing but I’m terrified of the pain.
62238,"Also, if you find ibuprofen doesn't work for you, naproxen might."
62239,Supplemental magnesium has been really helpful for me and a lot of my friends.
62240,I like the Calm brand of drink mix.
62241,Talk to Dr.  ...
62242,Sometimes prescribing birth control pills can help.
62243,thanks but come to think of it itd be good to add to my list of suffering i put myself thru lol
62244,Good read.
62245,Thank you.
62246,But check it out when your not on BC
62247,It's the one thing no one warned me about.
62248,I feel it my duty to not put someone through what I went through the first one.
62249,Thank you.
62250,And thank you for taking the time to post such vital information.
62251,Me too!!
62252,!
62253,No.
62254,"Maybe it's a cultural thing, but the word ""period"" to me means just the time you are actively bleeding."
62255,Not the entire cycle.
62256,"yeah, i’ve had this new cycle for probably three months now, seems like my body just decided to spice things up a bit"
62257,Damn.
62258,Year 5.
62259,I'm finished with menopause!
62260,It was a 10 year cycle.
62261,I had my GYN give me a blood test to see where I was in the cycle.
62262,I was finished!
62263,[deleted]
62264,Is that something they check during a pap?
62265,Or when they did ultrasounds during pregnancy?
62266,I had a few ultrasounds due to spotting but nothing was ever wrong.
62267,"Otherwise no, not specifically."
62268,I cramped for about 5 days.
62269,"I'm not bleeding anymore but I have this sinking suspicion it'll start back up any moment (I know that sounds paranoid but I've kinda learned to listen to my gut feelings, so...)"
62270,I have not taken birth control since I had my daughter 7 years ago and my period is also super irregular.
62271,Like I wasn't prepared to start overnight at work.
62272,I had my tubes tied.
62273,"I’m 25, I am around 87kg at the moment, so not underweight but this isn’t my usual weight, I’m bloated, and I last had sex about a week ago."
62274,"I’m not too concerned as I have been struggling with this since I got my second dose of the covid vaccine, and I don’t know why."
62275,I’m just concerned that I might have more serious underlying health issues than pregnancy
62276,"I can’t speak for everyone, but for me I just never have any menstrual blood anymore."
62277,I might have some spotting once or twice a year.
62278,"But otherwise, I just never have a period."
62279,No cycle.
62280,Nothing.
62281,A hormonal IUD prevents the estrogen spike that triggers the follicular phase.
62282,Your uterus never prepares to host an embryo and your ovaries don’t release eggs.
62283,"Thank you so much for replying, I thought this would get lost in the hundreds of comments!"
62284,"Depending how heavy your cycle is and what your circumstances are, I know people who SWEAR by reuseable pads."
62285,"I love menstrual underwear but just found out recently that they’re leeching carcinogens into my body and the water supply (Thinx) so don’t buy those 😓 if you have a heavier flow, you can use the two together with the underpants as backup for the pad—I have some friends who have done this with great success!"
62286,I found that the reusable disc was much more comfortable than the disposable ones!
62287,And it’s made out of silicone so it’s much softer and over time it will form to your body shape.
62288,"Personally, I use the June brand, I have a cup from them too but I prefer the disc."
62289,I couldn’t recommend it more!
62290,I don't like wearing tampons either unless I'm going swimming or I'm bleeding really heavily and I've got stuff to do.
62291,I realised that pads were really wasteful and I was spending a fair amount every month on buying cotton pads (because the plasticy ones irritated my skin) so I bought two packs of 10 reusable pads.
62292,I simply rinse them in cold water (or soak if I've had it in for a few hours) and then put them in the washing machine with my normal wash.
62293,So much better for me and the environment!
62294,There are different sizes of cups.
62295,You may have to try different sizes.
62296,It's not a one size fits all.
62297,Also your cervix position can affect the fit of menstrual cups.
62298,"Your cervix can be high, low, tilted, retroverted or retroflexed it's all normal"
62299,"Imo look into localized hormones (nuvaring, hormonal iud), they have much fewer side effects than the pill and implant."
62300,"Depends on your definition of rust, but the easiest way to tell is have a look at any images or videos of people bleaching patterns into black tee shirts!"
62301,"Black generally goes through orange before it goes anywhere near what we think of as a ""bleached"" colour, so that is super normal"
62302,Not at all.
62303,They can vary from pinkish to bright red to rusty.
62304,"Menstrual discharge isn't all blood, but blood is definitely in there, and so any color blood can be can show up in menstrual stains."
62305,"Omg my heart just broke for you reading this

I am so SO sorry you were made to feel like that, and that woman treating you like that."
62306,"There is absolutely no excuse for how vile she treated you, for having a normal functioning body no less!"
62307,I am one of those who always have discharge.
62308,"It would make my panties feel clammy, or even wet."
62309,"It would settle in the crotch, and when I was young I would try to wipe it out as much as I could."
62310,What really helped me was wearing cotton panty liners.
62311,"I can easily change them so I can keep feeling dry and fresh, and I've got no more wet, bleached panties."
62312,So remember; you are perfect as you are.
62313,"Your body works as intended, and there's nothing to be ashamed about."
62314,"Be kind to yourself, sending you all the love, good vibes, and hugs, and if you ever find yourself wanting or needing more of that, we'll be right here ❤️❤️❤️"
62315,"Warning - this might be disturbing for some to read (no SA though, just horrible parents)."
62316,I had a stepdad do this to me from the ages of 11-14 or so.
62317,"My mom frequently divorced and remarried during my childhood (its own set of traumas) but this one guy was basically a house-husband for her and so did things like laundry, etc."
62318,"I've always had acidic discharge that will bleach any brightly colored undies, and quite a bit of discharge right before my period."
62319,"I also had very irregular periods from what I now know is PCOS, but this meant I would get surprise stains all the time because I didn't know it was coming."
62320,"He would pull my dirty panties out of the laundry and loudly, in front of everyone, berate me for being ""dirty"" and ""nasty"" and ask me what I did to make my underwear so gross."
62321,"He would also mistake the blood stains for ""skid marks"" and call me disgusting and yell at me for not wiping properly."
62322,"I was already a painfully shy and introverted kid with a huge anxiety problem, and this just increased it."
62323,"I would hide my underwear, and even hid some health issues because I thought I was just ""gross""."
62324,"Ahhh my own mom said something similar to me as a kid in front of my aunt and uncle to humiliate me she goes ""I'm sick of washing your underwear with all your sauce in it!"""
62325,"Really fucked me up for a while, she's my mom she's supposed to tell me what's normal and natural not make fun of me."
62326,Probably what was wrong was I didn't change my underwear which I was in third grade or fourth grade meaning I was about nine.
62327,She should have been making sure I knew hygiene practices not mocking me.
62328,"That's so awful and frustrating to hear, but I hate to say I can relate."
62329,When I was 16 I went on an exchange and had no idea that the host mother would be coming and grabbing my laundry to add to theirs almost every day (which felt super invasive already).
62330,I leaked two days in a row and was embarassed so I had carefully hand washed those and set them aside.
62331,Well apparently me not having x underwear to match x days turned into the oldest host daughter telling others how I was unclean and not changing everyday.
62332,So it all turned out to be embarrassing in a totally different way for me.
62333,Thankfully I didn't know about what she was saying until the trip was almost over (just 3 weeks with the family).
62334,"And when I did find out, it as under the guise of, she's spreading this awful rumor that no one really believes."
62335,"But also birth control isn't a ""real"" period."
62336,It is withdrawal bleeding.
62337,So while it does regulate and can help cramps it is not a typical period
62338,Same here.
62339,I've been on birth control since I was a teen because I was passing big clots all the time and bleeding through everything.
62340,I had to use a bedwetting sheet and even take it to sleepovers!
62341,Since being on the pill my period is soooo light.
62342,I could get away with panty liners at the beginning and end of I wanted.
62343,Of course BC isn't for everyone but it can be so helpful
62344,Oh yeah I have a tens machine too!!
62345,I’ll add that you can get t a great tens unit on Amazon for under $50.
62346,There’s lots out there that are marketed specifically to uterus hackers that cost waaaay too much money.
62347,#pinktax
62348,I also will add that birth control enabled me to walk with my period.
62349,Cramps that debilitate can be helped.
62350,I had the same kind of periods.
62351,It turned out I had hypothyroidism.
62352,"Once I was put on thyroid medication, my periods were basically the same as when I was on oral bc."
62353,Yes it’s easier to get ahead of cramping than to be in a lot of pain and then start with OTCs.
62354,The medication in Alece is naproxen which is the same as extra strength Midol.
62355,Yes!
62356,I’ve found some really nice PMS tea blends and they almost all have red raspberry leaf.
62357,Thank you!
62358,TIL.. honestly I mostly just do Yoga With Adrian on YouTube
62359,"Sound like ovulation pain for sure, but still bring it up to your doctor."
62360,Try and track the cramping and see if it’s mostly on one side or the other.
62361,I had no idea about the armpits!
62362,Our bodies are wild!
62363,"Same as the bleaching, some it Will.lighten the fabric color and some it will make little holes over time."
62364,"Now, that's not the same as when the liner comes unglued on the kind of underwear where it's glued a line panel To the rest of the fabric."
62365,That's that wear and tear or workmanship.
62366,Ooh I’m so glad you got some questions answered!
62367,💕
62368,I absolutely second the bit about post-menopausal bleeding!
62369,My mother just went through a whirlwind treatment where she went straight to her doctor when she noticed bleeding.
62370,"She had endometrial cancer, and thanks to her quick response (and a good dollop of luck) it was caught in stage 1A and she just needed surgery, no chemo or anything 🙌"
62371,"And, important to note, while your body is trying to sort out menopause (i.e., you haven't had an uninterrupted year with no period), you can absolutely get pregnant."
62372,Don't forget to use birth control during this time!
62373,"Because your cycle is unpredictable now, it's harder to gauge when you're ovulating, etc."
62374,Thank you!
62375,It’s also a much more emotional time.
62376,"One of those, I thought I had come to terms with never having the chance to have kids but then your fertility just slaps you in the face."
62377,*sigh* Sorry.
62378,Not starting this whole rant.
62379,Thank you for all the advice.
62380,I truly appreciate it ❤️❤️
62381,😂 the million dollar question.
62382,Who knows - maybe if you notice clots every time you go to the bathroom?
62383,Of course I wouldn’t say that lots of clots = problematic since I’m no doctor but I feel like women end up accepting a lot of annoyances and issues as just normal and we don’t dig deeper.
62384,"If you're in doubt, mention it to your doctor!!"
62385,"This is especially important because if you start clotting more or less in the future, that's a change you should mention as well."
62386,(Disclaimer: not a doctor) *I think* clots are different from small bits of tissue that are less than ten centimetres or so.
62387,I get those all through the period.
62388,"Clots are clumps, and they stay kind of clumped in the toilet water."
62389,You might get some on the tissue that seem like clumps but it’s really just thicker blood (or blood with some mucous) that mostly disperse or spread in water.
62390,"I’m not a doctor or a mum, but I was always told they should be no larger than a coin."
62391,"If they are it could be a symptom of something else, and it would be best to see your doctor about it"
62392,Yeah might be a good idea to book an appointment with your doctor - could be something worth exploring.
62393,Might end up being something benign too but it may explain some other symptoms you’ve been having that you considered was normal?
62394,That's awesome
62395,"*hugs* mine did that to me too, specially in my teen years."
62396,"Thank you for mentioning this, and I hope it will get easier for you in the future ❤️"
62397,I got my doctor to prescribe continuous birth control and it probably saved my life.
62398,Good to know!
62399,I figured something was wrong but too worried to find out if that makes sense.
62400,"And know that after you give birth, your intestines are going to be all, well we don’t wanna poo as stuff hurts down there but you really gotta poo to stay healthy so maybe pick up some stool softeners and Metamucil because you may have stitches and the idea of pushing AGAIN is terrifying."
62401,"For my daughters, I made up a postpartum bag of “goodies” like this."
62402,"Think “what is my husband not going to want to ask for at the drugstore after I have the baby.”  My rather private daughter was horrified at all these intimate things but confided later “do that same thing for sister, please”  Pads, Tylenol, if you have a bidet, the ice things, etc."
62403,get them even if you don’t think you’ll use them.
62404,"And love on that little squish, you got this."
62405,Sis checking in wanted to add.
62406,If you are considering birth controls right after pregnancy I would recommend an IUD I had the mirena.
62407,I’ve heard some women who get the before having children and they say it hurts getting put in.
62408,I got mine relatively soon after I had my son didn’t hurt at all!
62409,I also breast fed for almost 2 years never got a period until I got my IUD taken out about 3-4 years after my son can’t remember exactly.
62410,So I didn’t really have a period for about 5 years!
62411,Definitely something to consider and talk to your doctor about!
62412,"Also about the bleeding, they sent me home with ginormous pads I think it was about a week for me."
62413,"Also, using ice on the area is a life saver!"
62414,Good luck with baby!
62415,<3
62416,I did and *I know.
62417,* Scary right?
62418,Most aren’t that big but they can be pretty crazy.
62419,And literally no one told me that could even happen.
62420,I thought I was dying after my oldest was born.
62421,Lol.
62422,I had some pretty huge clots (probably clementine size) even after a csection.
62423,Honestly other things were hurting so bad I didnt even notice the pain from passing it.
62424,"I just felt it plop out, which was an interesting and odd feeling in itself."
62425,No it isn't ☹️ for me it really helps to have people who understand it without any judgement.
62426,Being able to talk about it really helped my anxiety about it
62427,"Mid thirties, after a decade and a half

May all future diagnoses be as quick as yours"
62428,I always have a couple of terrible nights sleep before my period too.
62429,"Unfortunately there’s not a whole lot you can do except treat the individual side effects, sorry lovely!"
62430,I know that my sister had sensitive skin and she used hair conditioner instead of cream.
62431,"After reading this information, I am going to continue to do nothing about it lol"
62432,Magnesium is great for migraines and sleep!
62433,"Purely anecdotal, but I’ve found magnesium supplements help to lessen my PMDD"
62434,What do you mean?
62435,"Please note that if your clots are regularly much larger than a quarter, you need to talk to a gynaecologist to make sure you don’t have a medical condition going on."
62436,"Right, but the period is *part* of the menstrual cycle, which is mentioned in the first line of your quote."
62437,"It’s not the only part of the menstrual cycle, which are listed in the original post."
62438,My impression is that Mom didn’t want to scare anyone into thinking that their period would last the whole 28 days.
62439,My cycles over the last 5 years have ranged from 22 to 105 days.
62440,I’m over it
62441,Congratulations!
62442,You’d need an internal ultrasound to see it and it’s not something I think they check for during pregnancy
62443,"It could be any number of things, but it’s important to rule out fibroids because if it is fibroids, early treatment is 1000 times better that late."
62444,"Don’t panic, but make an appointment."
62445,This is not a wait and see sort of symptom.
62446,Did you have the heavy cramping before your ligation?
62447,I wasn't thinking pregnancy.
62448,"Periods can stop because of malnutrition and while weight isn't always an indicator, it is the best one."
62449,Have you had a sudden weight loss/gain?
62450,Have you had blood work done to rule out anemia?
62451,"There are things that cause weight changes and anemia that are pretty serious and need to be addressed, so if any weight fluctuation wasn't intentional, it's a pretty important symptom."
62452,Tbh you should have a full set of labs done and see a gyno.
62453,Rule out other things before you move on to vaccine injury.
62454,"If that's not possible, start a multi vitamin and be sure you're getting the proper nutrition/calories."
62455,"Start keeping a symptom journal that includes not only symptoms but daily temperature, blood pressure, activity and intake/output."
62456,"It may take me awhile, but I’m trying to keep up."
62457,I underestimated how many people would respond to this.
62458,I’m a reusable pad evangelical.
62459,They’re more comfortable than disposable pads and wayyyy more absorbent.
62460,"And now that I’m pregnant, sometimes I wear them for bladder leaks too!"
62461,What’s this now about carcinogens from Thinx!?
62462,I ask semi-panicked as I’m currently on my third day of wearing them…
62463,This hit way too close to home.
62464,I don’t have any comforting words.. i’m sorry this happened to us.
62465,"I hope OPs post can instill confidence in other young people that regular discharge is NORMAL

and not to be crude, but its also beneficial."
62466,Never having to buy lube is pretty nice
62467,"I edited my old post bc i forgot a “not” when trying to say “i know im not alone in these thoughts”

I dont wanna say “im glad there are others like me” bc thats not how i feel, rather im glad that someone else can relate?"
62468,It sounds shitty no matter how i word it.
62469,"Im sorry that happened to you, it truly is awful."
62470,"I grew up in an abusive household so i was used to pretty much everything, but having my own body called into question was a first."
62471,My host family was based in germany.
62472,"I worry about the children bc the mom literally beat the kids, and openly expressed how she wanted more."
62473,16 to be precise.
62474,They had 6 at the time.
62475,"The older ones tugged at my heart strings (oldest was 12)

I wish i had a way to report them."
62476,The oldest would be around 22.
62477,"My german isnt fluent enough anymore, but that house had a LOT of fucked up shit going on including physical abuse, i left the exchange 6 months early with severe trauma."
62478,"It was also a smaller town in east Germany, so idk how to even to a well fare check on them."
62479,Isn’t that what a regular period is too?
62480,"Your body turns off certain hormones and your body goes “right, time to get rid of all these furnishings since no baby is taking up occupancy this month.”"
62481,She is amazing!
62482,"Fyi, she has a ‘moon practice’ and a ‘yoga for cramps/pms’ video 👍 Also one called ‘yoga for women’ for the same time."
62483,"I never really thought about pms because I haven’t had breast pain tied to pms since the very first pill I went on nearly a decade ago, but sure enough it lines up every time!"
62484,And yep!
62485,"It’s not like a major issue so I feel like it’s fine waiting a couple months until my next physical, but it’s staying on my list of things to bring up then."
62486,"I finally learned about the bleaching in my late 20s, but had no idea about the holes!"
62487,So interesting
62488,Good news that it was caught so early.
62489,Kudos to her for paying attention!
62490,"I am with you, made peace with not having kids (not in a good enough relationship until my 40s), but as the clock winds down, there was definitely some strong emotions tied to the opportunity truly going away."
62491,It took me by surprise.
62492,Thank you for the advice.
62493,"I do have a few other symptoms that are a bit off though (bloated constantly, sometimes bleeding after sex etc)."
62494,I’ll make an appointment with the doctor xx
62495,Omgosh yes bc they are so rearranged.
62496,Pooping and gas hurt for a while after giving birth.
62497,But instead of Metamucil I suggest peri-colace.
62498,You can find it at any drug store.
62499,Not a flashy bottle but usually more $$$ than other meds.
62500,It's worth it.
62501,Extremely gentle and effective.
62502,No cramping at all.
62503,It's what the hospital used after my mother had her colon resectioned and she needed to poop to leave the hospital.
62504,I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it before then.
62505,"I tell everyone I can, about it."
62506,Could you write a list here of what things you included?
62507,Important.
62508,Mum checking in!
62509,I've been on almost every contraceptive known for women.
62510,Learned quite quickly I'm very susceptible to hormone medication.
62511,"One of the advantages of the hormone based contraceptive coil is that it doesn't effect me in the same way the implant, shot, or pill would."
62512,The hormones stay in the tissue around the coil and don't travel so you won't be effected but are still 99% covered.
62513,"Couple of things to note for contraceptive coil:

1) you can't use tampons anymore as this might rip your coil out."
62514,"2) there is a high chance your periods will stop, that is normal."
62515,"3) during implantation, eat some chocolate beforehand, have some for after, take a good dose of painkillers an hour before the appointment, bring heat pads and wear your comfy clothes."
62516,Nothing too tight on your tummy!
62517,I’m lucky enough to be married to a man who understands and supports me through it.
62518,We are 45 and have been married 20 years and he has supported and helped me all this time.
62519,I use shampoo.
62520,It works better for me than shaving cream
62521,That when you have less frequent period when you are not on birth control talk to your doctor.
62522,it is normal to not have a bleeding when you are on birth control but if you aren't it might still increase risks so it is best too discuss it
62523,"Very true, for me it was endometrial hyperplasia."
62524,"I will be honest, it felt good getting my diagnosis, since it let me know what was happening and gave me understanding."
62525,"Best advice I can give anyone with a period, if it doesn't feel right to you, talk to a doctor."
62526,>My impression is that Mom didn’t want to scare anyone into thinking that their period would last the whole 28 days.
62527,Precisely.
62528,are you taking any meds for hot flashes and mood swings?
62529,Thank you!
62530,Have you had the blood test yet?
62531,Yes.
62532,With each child it just got worse.
62533,I've had 2.
62534,I remember my second period ever I hurt so bad i cried.
62535,My first period three months before that had lasted 8 days.
62536,I'm 34 now and have been dealing with irregular painful periods that medication heat pads and such doesn't help.
62537,But pressure does.
62538,And I almost think it's because when I was bleeding out they started pushing on my uterus.
62539,I did gain around 5kgs in less than a month and I unfortunately live in the UK where the NHS is slammed and I’ve been waiting for about five months to get a blood test.
62540,I thought fuck it and started saving so that I can go private for a full health check up as this is concerning to me.
62541,"I use myfitnesspal and my current calorie intake is 1200 calories a day and some days I can’t even hit that as I get full really fast 😭 Also, I wasn’t thinking of a vaccine injury bc I know that vaccine injuries, while possible, are very rare"
62542,"I also have an Apple Watch Series 6 that I use everyday, so it keeps track of how many steps, blood pressure, etc"
62543,"You're doing amazingly, thank you!"
62544,I had no idea these were a thing!
62545,"I’m getting my tubes removed soon so I won’t need an iud and will have periods again, so I need to look into this."
62546,[Here](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/consumer-products/apparel/thinx-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-underwear-contains-harmful-chemicals/) [are a few](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2022/04/new-lawsuit-contends-period-products-contain-forever-chemicals) [sources](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/thinx-underwear-pfas-lawsuit-survives-bid-dismiss-2021-06-23/)—I just linked 3 different articles on it.
62547,"Tl;dr: class-action lawsuit, Thinx contain PFAS even though they said they don’t."
62548,If you still have the adress and everything you could goolge the local “Jugendamt“ and call them during work hours probably.
62549,"Technically, yes."
62550,"But I think they mean to say that, with birth control, there's no dead egg or thickened mucus to get rid of (which is why it can also help people with endometriosis)."
62551,"So when you get to your placebo or pill free week, all that's causing the bleeding is the drop in hormones."
62552,"Your body still goes through the motions, despite not really having anything to expel."
62553,"That's also why periods are lighter on birth control, and why it's perfectly safe to skip your ""period"" on the pill."
62554,Edit: wording
62555,Lol 34 and just learned about the holes!
62556,"Sanitary pads, stool softeners, Metamucil, nursing pads, topical spray relief, Tucks, peri bottle, Advil (check w your doc on what they will let you take), Pinterest has lots of suggestions if you search postpartum supplies mom."
62557,That is so great to hear!
62558,Happy that you have a supportive husband!
62559,Thank you.
62560,I don’t have those symptoms.
62561,I just have incredibly irregular cycles.
62562,"I’ve been tracking my cycles for 21 years (I’m prone to blood clots and an oops pregnancy wouldn’t be a problem, so I don’t mind relying on natural family planning), so I KNOW when I ovulate."
62563,"What happens is I will go through the whole follicular phase with all the symptoms, but no ovulation and no sustained post ovulation temperature shift."
62564,And then I will go through the follicular phase again with no ovulation and no sustained temperature shift.
62565,"So that that tells me is that my estrogen levels are no longer high enough to truly trigger ovulation, but they haven’t given up trying either."
62566,"My ovaries have a faulty starter 😆 

My only other symptoms are a slowed metabolism and vaginal dryness."
62567,"I used to produced a ridiculous amount of cervical mucous, so I never needed to use lube until my mid-40’s."
62568,"I have not, but I haven’t stopped having periods either."
62569,They’re just very inconsistent
62570,Have you tried a compression garment?
62571,Like spanx?
62572,I love them so much lol.
62573,I tell everyone about them.
62574,I get mine from [Soft Taco Reusables](https://softtacoreusables.ca/).
62575,"Also, inter-labial pads are a game changer, even if you’re using disposable pads."
62576,They make them in all kinds of shapes and patterns.
62577,"When I took The Pill for bad periods, my doctor told me to skip the placebo pills."
62578,It was awesome.
62579,I was just supposed to take a few days off whenever I had spotting or breakthrough bleeding.
62580,I highly recommend continuous cycle to anyone on birth control!
62581,Haha I’m 30 and this is news to me!
62582,What temperature shift?
62583,What are you talking about?
62584,How much less have you had to eat/how much have you gained?
62585,If you don’t mind answering.
62586,I’m mostly concerned about the mood swings and hot flashes (my mother always had mood swings lol but she had hot flashes.)
62587,and I guess weight gain.
62588,Although my diet has gotten substantially better over the last few years.
62589,I believe they can give you the test even if you still have periods.
62590,Are you 50 yet?
62591,No.
62592,I don't like tight clothes.
62593,It's going to sound strange but I'm clousterfobic.
62594,"I also take continuous BC pills because I used to get sick every time I had my placebo week (when I wasn't on the pill and had real periods, I'd get badly sick...every month)."
62595,"Continuous is a game changer, and I usually only have breakthrough bleeding once or twice a year."
62596,"After ovulation, your temperature will go up 0.2 degrees and that increase will last right up until you start your period."
62597,"So when I don’t get the temperature shift, it means I’m not getting the progesterone surge that causes it."
62598,I was consistently 175 as an adult without having to be particularly thoughtful about it.
62599,I creeped up to almost 220 before going on WW.
62600,I now have to be careful to stay below 185.
62601,"No, 44."
62602,"Well, I’m officially sunk for ideas."
62603,Sorry!
62604,Yes!
62605,One or two “periods” a year was amazing!
62606,You have a while to go!
62607,"Once your last period is over, it's about a year, then you have 9 more."
62608,I had a hysterectomy so I just had to figure out the timing by hot flashes and migraines.
62609,Lol.
62610,I guess I can get my kid to lay on uterus.
62611,Even though she's almost as big as me.
62612,"Yeah, right now my body’s just being an asshole about it."
62613,Oh well.
62614,I was 45 when I started noticing the PMS symptoms changing.
62615,Without a period it was very hard to figure out the timing.
62616,Plus that was before the accurate tests they have now.
62617,I won't miss the ovulation pain or the breast tenderness.
62618,So excited!
62619,How did it happen?
62620,What did he say?
62621,Where were you?
62622,Tell me everything!!
62623,!
62624,"In my true mom form, I am going to tell you:

Congrats, my sweet!"
62625,I am so happy for you!
62626,The ring is gorgeous!
62627,Let me know when you've scheduled a date.
62628,"I'll do everything I can to help when you want, if you want (like, if I were your rl mum [but if you're in Chicago, I'm here for you for real])."
62629,"Quit biting your nails, goose!"
62630,"<3

62795,I thought that finger was for wedding band
62796,How many moms?
62797,we were walking around the movie theater we usually go to and there’s this big fountain that i like that lights up in different colors.
62798,we went up to it to watch it and he started fumbling with his bag so i kinda figured it out early lol but he got down on one knee and said “hi will you marry me” and i cried even though i expected it.
62799,:’)
62800,"As someone who chronically picks my fingernails and skin, I am *mortified* thinking about one day getting engaged and having to post a picture showing my awful fingers😭"

62818,we picked it out together but when he proposed was a surprise :)
62819,it's cubic zircona and sterling silver!
62820,neither of us has a lot of money rn so a fancy gem isn't really an option but what matters to me is it's pretty and it means i've got a whole life with my fiancé ahead of me.
62821,<3
62822,engagement and wedding bands

62835,"I knew my husband was going to propose, I just wasn't sure exactly when, so I made sure my nails looked nice constantly until it happened."
62836,"Oh my glob, ouch."
62837,I'm a skin picker like mad.
62838,Hands like a horror film prop over here.
62839,I know exactly how you feel.
62840,It's really hard to stop biting nails.
62841,Get a professional manicure with filing and light cuticle maintenance and remind yourself you paid actual money for it.
62842,Get a nail scrubber and lotion and make that a habit.
62843,That's what helped me.
62844,"And when they grew a bit, it felt so good that I wanted them to keep on!"
62845,And your ring is divine.
62846,I absolutely love it.
62847,"Congratulations on the big moment, darlin'!!!"
62848,!
62849,"I'm a chronic picker, so the skin around my nails looks pretty rough more often than not."
62850,I empathize completely.
62851,"I give myself manicures pretty often, but stress doesn't give a shit about any of that."
62852,Best wishes to you!
62853,💖
62854,nice one
62855,That's wonderful.
62856,You already know you can live with each other habits.

62860,<3
62861,GENIUS!!
62862,"Thank you, I am going to tell my boyfriend about this ASAP😂"
62863,i’ve been painting my nails regularly to try and get rid of the urge bc i do really like how they look when they’re longer and painted but man is the temptation hard when nerves hit.
62864,thank you!!
62865,!
62866,Good luck!
62867,How long have you guys been together?
62868,We are both 27 and we’ll have been together 4 years next month!

62870,I’m so glad you’re feeling better.

62874,Shake and bake with mac and cheese and baby carrots?
62875,Long haul covid is awful!
62876,Have you enrolled yourself in the Long haul studies?

62878,They usually offer treatment for long haulers.
62879,Some of it has been successful!
62880,I'm so proud of you.
62881,"You can do amazing things, and given all you've been through, this is pretty fucking amazing."

62892,I hope you really enjoyed your meal!
62893,"Good job baby, it looks great."
62894,Keep giving your body the best fuel you can manage.
62895,"Complete, balanced meals are great and it feels so gratifying to make something delicious."
62896,Just remember not to beat yourself up on days when you're not up to this standard.
62897,"Doing a halfway good job is much better than just not doing it, so as long as you manage something, I'm proud of you."
62898,That looks GREAT!
62899,Go you!
62900,That looks so good!

62932,"I remember when I had long haul covid, before it even had a name, that it was brutal."
62933,The fatigue and the brain fog meant that sometimes I couldn't even put the groceries away.
62934,It was awful.
62935,But slowly (very slowly) it did eventually pass and I was back to my old self.
62936,I'm confident the same will happen for you.
62937,This is a beautiful sign of recovery!
62938,I'm so proud of you!

62962,I hope you continue to love yourself by cooking this way more often.
62963,You are worth this level of self-love.

63003,That looks delish
63004,Wow moms (and sibs too!).
63005,Thank you all so much.
63006,I can’t believe the attention this got.
63007,You’ve all been so sweet; I didn’t realize how much I needed some of that compassion and validation.
63008,"I was working my way through a breakdown but with the help of my therapist I was managing day to day, but then I caught the rona in early January."
63009,I’ve been dealing with long-haul ever since.
63010,"I’ve never been so exhausted in all my life, even with fibromyalgia and depression contributing to constant fatigue."
63011,The first two months after I got sick I pretty much just ordered delivery.
63012,"Then I was able to stock the freezer with nuggets and fries and fish sticks, stuff I could just throw in the oven on a baking sheet."
63013,Recently I’ve been able to put something simple on the stove like a pot of pasta and then just dump some shredded cheese on it.
63014,"But last night was the first time I could gather the mental energy to cook multiple things, and the physical energy to stand at the stove and pull it off."
63015,"I’ve been beating myself up about how little I can do instead of focusing on the improvements, so thank you, thank you so much for reminding me ❤️"
63016,This looks incredible sib!
63017,"Check out r/covidlonghaulers and r/cfs (i have ME/CFS and it is very similar to long covid) if you haven’t already too, they have a lot of resources and information !"
63018,It looks amazing.
63019,Don't ever feel like it's not enough or like you're not enough.
63020,You're amazing.
63021,❤️
63022,"That meal looks amazing, I am so proud of you!"
63023,"Keep trying to put yourself first, your health and happiness are the most important thing!"
63024,You have come such a long way in getting past all this and I have so much faith in you!
63025,I ate a bowl of broccli with dressing for lunch yesterday.
63026,You got this.
63027,This was a 3 course meal.
63028,You got this kid!!
63029,!

63031,It looks amazing.
63032,"Sis here, I'm so proud of you!"
63033,This looks so yummy.
63034,I love you!
63035,sis over here crying for you.
63036,sometimes putting a bowl of cereal together is too hard for me and i chew some gum instead.
63037,"i’m so proud of you, and this looks amazing."
63038,inspiring me to actually cook something tonight.
63039,💗
63040,I am so proud of you.
63041,Like legit.
63042,And that looks delicious.
63043,I'm at the end of week two recovering from Covid.
63044,I'm making chicken tonight too!
63045,I'd be fine with cereal again but I'm hoping some actual cooked food helps me feel better.
63046,I'm thrilled to hear you're doing so much better!!
63047,That meal looks fantastic and I hope every bite gives you strength and brings back some mental clarity.
63048,Hugs babe!
63049,"did you make this, or is this take out ( just kidding) I'm glad you're feeling better."
63050,I have this on my big monitor and all I can focus on is the cheese...
63051,I hope it tasted as good as it looks
63052,Yup!
63053,I mix my own shake and bake because I find the premade super salty.
63054,I have a jar of it in the pantry and just pull a couple scoops out when I need it
63055,"I’ve made it into the long-haul clinic here, but they still have me at the assessment stage."
63056,Hopefully will get my personalized treatment plan soon
63057,My thoughts exactly!
63058,I know what I'm making for dinner!
63059,I totally text my therapist and my OT 😆
63060,"Homemade shake and bake

1 cup panko
1 Tbsp cornmeal
1 Tbsp corn starch
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic power
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp smoked paprika 
1/2 tsp sage 

Pulse the heck out of it in a food processor, store extra in an airtight container (makes enough for many, many servings)."
63061,Coat chicken with olive oil and then shake with seasoning.
63062,Bake on a rack at 375 until internal temp of 170
63063,"I’m in /cfs already, but I’ll definitely join /covidlonghaulers!"
63064,Thanks!
63065,Yeah I had fibro already and long haul is like fibro on crack.
63066,I never thought I’d wish to go back to “just” fibro and migraine and depression lol
63067,It definitely did ☺️ I made extra cheese sauce too and ate it on pretty much everything all week lol
63068,Smart!
63069,"And looks delish, glad you’re taking care of yourself."
63070,I'm so glad!
63071,I wish you the best of luck and I hope you get through that stage soon.
63072,Oh I’ve never understood why people apologize about mobile formatting until now.
63073,"I typed that list of ingredients as a list, not a run-on paragraph 😳"
63074,"Nerves just mean you're taking this seriously, and if they trip you up at all don't be afraid to just say something like ""Sorry if I've got a few nerves, I'm just really excited about this opportunity""."
63075,"You look polished and prepared, hope this opportunity turns out to be the right one for you!"
63076,I think it went well!
63077,The interviewer was really nice and seemed to like me!

63094,Chin up.
63095,Shoulders back.
63096,You’re gonna [knock their socks off!]
63097,I copied the text I sent her and only changed that last line.
63098,I’m a little more vulgar with my sister.
63099,lol.
63100,You'll knock their socks off
63101,It'll be awkward but everything is always awkward.
63102,So do your best in spite of it.
63103,"Don’t worry, you’ll be great!"
63104,You’ll show them that you fit into their company and have the skills they need to push the business forward.
63105,I want you to let your light shine  -you have so many gifts that they’d be fools to let you go.
63106,"Good luck, baby-it will be great!"
63107,Good luck!

63150,Love that color on you!
63151,"Remember, if you get nervous or ahead of yourself, it’s okay to ask to repeat the question."
63152,People can smell bs and would rather a person check themselves and try again more thoughtfully.
63153,Negotiate and don’t sell yourself short.
63154,"I bet you have more than you realize to offer, and if you do already know, well, then we all know you’re going to kill it."
63155,"Get it, and let us know how it goes!"

63366,thanks mom <3
63367,Oh anxiety.
63368,That rotten little voice that whispers lies to you.

63377,Thanks mom!
63378,I actually really needed that right now.
63379,God sometimes I wish I could internalize this but the amount of sleepless hours I've spent writing all my things from short stories to dnd campaigns have really told me anxiety is a bitch
63380,"After I realized what you went through and yet how energetic you are, I deeply trust you mom"
63381,Work's been tough recently and i honestly needed to see this

63406,I know!
63407,I love her work.
63408,You can argue with the picture of the deer but I don't think it works.
63409,Perhaps I didn't argue long enough?
63410,Hope things get better friend.
63411,You're doing the best you can.
63412,❤️ - Mom
63413,Noticing is the first step to making things better.
63414,The fact that you are aware enough to recognize that things could be better is a good start.
63415,You are doing the best that you can for the given moment.
63416,So how can we help?
63417,Every step you take is a step forward.
63418,If there is anything at all I can do let me know.❤️
63419,"You made it through today, that is good enough."
63420,Sometimes that can be the hardest thing.
63421,You are doing the best you can and that’s ok.❤️
63422,How does one know that you are not doing well?
63423,I'm just hard on myself and people around me are too happy to kick me and push me down to the pit?
63424,It's just that they are not interested in accepting even though I am doing good in certain areas...for example cooking.
63425,Even now I have family who are enjoying at my expense that I am worthless idler etc and looking down at me.
63426,The extent of this hurt has me obsessing over seeing cookery shows etc ... and making me more depressed 😔 even though I know that I am a very good Cook.
63427,It's just not right.. where I am having doubts about my own cooking skills because of the abusers.
63428,That’s me.
63429,Im letting myself and everyone I work with down 😞
63430,Sometimes you gotta lie to the liars in your brain.
63431,I think she knows you love her.
63432,Some bonds surpass everything.❤️
63433,"I hope you get the job, sweetie!"
63434,Good luck 💫
63435,You are ok.
63436,I believe in you.
63437,And you know what?
63438,"If you aren’t ok, that’s ok. It’s ok to not be ok."
63439,But we got you.
63440,And we know you’ll be ok. Sending you all the mom hugs and love.
63441,You matter to me.
63442,I see you and you are wonderful.
63443,I love you sweetie.❤️
63444,(Hug)
63445,"Even if everything is a mess today, tomorrow is hope."
63446,Your anxiety is lying to you.
63447,You sound like a fantastically creative person!❤️
63448,"I’m just a really lucky person, nothing special."
63449,You are stronger than you know.
63450,"The problems you have now, you may not even remember them in a year."
63451,Just make it until tomorrow.
63452,Tomorrow is a whole new adventure!
63453,I left the name on it.
63454,It’s the Latest Kate.🙂
63455,"If you are doing the best you can, you are doing enough."
63456,Don’t beat yourself up.
63457,Are you doing the best you can?
63458,That is enough.
63459,That was three years ago I think we can let this slide
63460,"I needed this, thank you."
63461,Thanks a lot.
63462,Though sometimes feel like I'm not writing well enough.
63463,"I'm scared sometimes my players will one day just up and off on me, basically tell me that I'm not doing well enough and that they really dislike the experience I'm giving them and whatnot despite them constantly telling me right now that I'm doing about as best as I can."
63464,Yeah but it’s best practice to link to the actual artists page so it’s smooth process.
63465,"Since you’re sharing their work, it’s important you make it as easy as possible for that artist you love so much to grow their audience."
63466,They worked hard on this drawing.
63467,Least you can do is make sure they get proper credit.
63468,I think you are doing wonderful.
63469,The more you write and hone your craft the better you will get.
63470,Keep writing.
63471,Point taken.
63472,How exciting!
63473,"I hope you’re not too nervous, everyone has to have a first day."
63474,Just take a breath when you need and be sure to ask questions if you’re not completely sure of something.
63475,Have a wonderful first day!
63476,Yay!

63511,"Remember a few things: 1) HR is not there to help you, only to protect the company from you suing them."
63512,"2) don't give anyone any more personal information than you have to, as unhappy and unfulfilled coworkers may use it against you in the most bizarre and unexpected of ways."

63612,Proud of you!!!
63613,Good luck!
63614,Congratulations!
63615,You've totally got this!
63616,Thank u!!
63617,The position I have I really don’t have to talk to ppl so I feel pretty good about this.I’m just worried somebody’s gonna try to get to know me and I freak out😅
63618,"Very awkward and weird I felt sooo out of place, especially since all my coworkers are adults."
63619,"Other than that it was what I expected, a lot like school, but this time I get paid 😁

Thank u btw!!"
63620,U taking the time out ur day to check on me means a lot
63621,Yes please!!!!!
63622,I was gonna go the the library and have someone help me but u helping me would mean alot
63623,"I really don't want to scare you but a lesson I had to learn and wished somebody told me was:

Don't give too much information about yourself to your co-workers or boss."
63624,Be vague.
63625,It's possible at some point somebody will hold information you give them against you.
63626,"That said, I Wish aaaallllllll the best and enjoy your first day."
63627,Much love my dear.
63628,You'll rock it!
63629,😊
63630,"What u/Brain_Booger said ...

>Don't give too much information about yourself to your co-workers or boss."
63631,Be vague.
63632,It's possible at some point somebody will hold information you give them against you.
63633,People can be real shitty so this advice is gold !
63634,"To state the obvious : Be friendly, but don't exhaust yourself trying to ""make"" friends."
63635,Sharing TMI or sacrificing time/energy/money to gain someone's friendship isn't worth it.
63636,"Just give yourself time ..... when you are several weeks/months into the job, you will instinctively find like minded folks among your coworkers."
63637,These are your friends.
63638,Good luck kiddo !
63639,Of course.
63640,That’s what moms do.
63641,And my first job interview was super awkward too.
63642,I was so nervous I sweat through my jacket!
63643,"I’m proud of you, honey!"
63644,message me!!
63645,!
63646,This is amazing advice!
63647,No one needs to know your personal stuff.
63648,I overshared when I was younger.
63649,"Don't be like me lol

My co-workers typically talked about: weather, and what movies or TV shows they watched."
63650,Those are the safest topinc
63651,"Best way to keep a coversation and good job environment is to talk about meaningless stuff and avoid any personal/controversial topics unless it becomes a need (like discrimination, harassment, medical needs or exemptions, etc.)"
63652,"And when it becomes a need, the only one who might need to know is HR or in a small business your employer."
63653,"Seriously EXCELLENT advice - not just at work, but life in general."
63654,"Unless it’s friends, family, trusted associates don’t share much of anything with acquaintances."
63655,It’s an underrated skill.
63656,This over and over again.
63657,I have never regretted holding personal information back from my coworkers.
63658,My only regrets ever came from giving too much of my self away.
63659,Thank you for clarifying some things even further.
63660,English is not my mother tongue.
63661,Yep.
63662,There are Tons of topics you can talk about.
63663,"Sports, advice where to eat/what's the best kebap in town, weather and movies like you said."
63664,"And even then, be superficial."
63665,"Don't be too invested in sports, don't talk about allergies, don't tell in which theater you go."
63666,And if they ask you specific questions you can always lie.
63667,"Like you, I overshared."
63668,Not once but TWICE until I learned my lesson 🤣
63669,"Damn, only took you twice?"
63670,"I had a chip on my shoulder, that if someone didn't know and accept *all of me*, then they couldn't like me."
63671,Made for a very lonely young adulthood.
63672,Yes!
63673,"Don't be afraid to lie, or just answer with a funny answer that is ridiculously wrong."
63674,Odds are they are just killing time to make conversation anyhow.
63675,Baby Doll!
63676,What a fantastic photo of a gorgeous woman!!!!
63677,I'm so excited for you.
63678,Huge accomplishment and so much fun and adventure heading toward you in life.

63885,Oh that smile!
63886,I’m so proud of you!
63887,Hey Mom!
63888,Thank you so much for all of the lovely words and comments.
63889,"I cried reading a few of them, I won't lie."
63890,"I got sick the past week so I wasn't able to reply, but I appreciate it very much"
63891,I'm getting serious mimfriend vibes from this comment lol
63892,Good to let people know!
63893,I take an SSRI and work in the heat all day.
63894,"When it gets into the upper 80's and 90's, I need to drink about a gallon a day!"
63895,I find it's really helpful to drink a hydration drink instead of water.
63896,The one I use is Liquid IV.
63897,It has a blend of sugar and electrolytes that comes closer to replacing what you sweat out.
63898,"It's pretty much identical to pedialyte, but cheaper and tastes better."
63899,"Not totally necessary when you need an extra glass or two of water, but I need it to keep my electrolytes balanced."
63900,"If I drink plain water, I still get woozy in the afternoon."
63901,"When I drink hydration drink, I can drink as much liquid as I need (4-6 quarts sometimes during a 10 hour workday) and I'm still thinking clearly at the end of the day!"
63902,"Thank you, mom."
63903,I didn't know this.
63904,"Damn I didn’t know this, thanks mom!"
63905,"u/Miss_squid_tickler my sincerest thank you, from the bottom of my (as I now know) overheated heart."
63906,"Thank you for posting this, and for providing me and others very valuable information."
63907,"I have no gold or awards to give you, all I can say is thank you!"
63908,WHAT THE ACTUAL F’ING F???
63909,I take the maximum approved dose for one of those.
63910,I’ve taken it for 5+ years!!!
63911,"I have frequently advised my doctors that I feel hot all the time, others will be completely dressed for cold weather yet I need nothing more than a light t-shirt and a pair of shorts, I can drink water all day - as much as as I physically can and my skin will still react as if I’m dehydrated."
63912,Yet NONE of them have ever mentioned these side effects!
63913,NONE!
63914,Never!!!
63915,"I also live in a place where it’s hot, humid, and sunny for 9 months of the year!!!"
63916,How was I never told these were the side effects???
63917,Why isn’t the risk of overheating on the pamphlet in the box or on the website?!?
63918,"It is all over medical sites, but only if I search for the specific information of “x drug overheating risk”."
63919,"Those sites have references to studies, list the doctors names, all info a person like me can verify."
63920,Thank you so much for this reminder.
63921,I’m overweight and on an antidepressant so it’s extra hot 😭😭
63922,Makes sense.
63923,Effexor makes me sweat way more than normal.
63924,"I love you too, Momma 💕"
63925,Some non-ssri medication can also raise risk of heat stroke.
63926,"If I pour ice cold water on my head, it feels warmer than the air by the time it reaches my thighs."
63927,I'm on 2 meds - a non-ssri anxiety med and a thyroid med - which make me run hot.
63928,It hasn't been below 90f in a month and my house doesn't have central air.
63929,"I've been secluded into a room with a window mount and a fan, other than going to the bathroom to just spray myself, clothes and all, with cold water."
63930,It's not worth undressing because it'll dry off within minutes anyway.
63931,But my hands and feet are still cold to the touch somehow?
63932,"Damn, I did not know this."
63933,Thanks so much Mom!
63934,!
63935,Wait!!??
63936,Is this why I haven’t tolerated heat well for as long as I can remember?!
63937,Good thing I’m tapering off …
63938,I’ve been on sertraline since February/March.
63939,Is this why I sweat so much??
63940,"It’s so bad it’s embarrassing and it actually makes me depressed because I can’t  wear nice summer clothes, wear my hair down or put on makeup."
63941,I always look like a sweaty slob.
63942,😢😭
63943,**ADDING TO PSA: THIS ALSO AFFECTS VENLAFAXINE AND QUETIAPINE.
63944,"**


Thanks Mum!"
63945,Love you many.
63946,This!
63947,My life changed when I started my SNRI.
63948,I got such hot flashes and sweat much more.
63949,Being hot triggers nausea (I also struggle with nausea daily).
63950,The combo of heat+nausea leads to anxiety attacks.
63951,And I'm always battling dehydration.
63952,"It's something I was never warned about, yet impacts me daily even a decade after starting said medication."
63953,"Others who have never experience this education side effect often think I'm exaggerating how awful it feels, or how it can leave you unable to do the simplest things like taking a walk in nice weather."
63954,But those that I know who have experienced it are always super empathetic.
63955,The best recent-ish purchase of mine was one of those little wear-around-your-neck fans.
63956,I also ha e a little rechargeable fan that flips open like a little old cellphone that can sit on the table if I'm sitting outdoors.
63957,I'm still on the hunt for a water bottle that truly keeps water cool for a long time.
63958,Thank you!
63959,This is so important.
63960,Thanks Momma!
63961,💗
63962,Whoa!
63963,"I’ve been taking SSRIs for 18 years now and have not been advised of this once, thank you mom ❤️!"
63964,"Thank you, Mom!"
63965,I always told my doctor I got overheated and sweated profusely ever since I started my meds and he never flipping believed me.
63966,I KNEW IT.
63967,"Good to know, my doctors did NOT inform me about this."
63968,And I used to be/am on two of those listed.
63969,Thanks mum!
63970,"popping in to specifically add zyprexa to this list

i've had to take it in the past and sometimes it felt like my blood was on fire 🙃"
63971,Aww so sweet.
63972,Thanks for the reminder❤️‍🩹
63973,"Thanks, Mom."
63974,I didn't know this until now
63975,Good to know!
63976,Thanks mommit!
63977,Didn’t know this!
63978,Thank you!
63979,!
63980,"Wow, I can’t believe I didn’t know this."
63981,Thank you!
63982,!
63983,Oh that’s why!!!
63984,Thanks!
63985,I feel less impostory now!
63986,Spironolactone too
63987,"Thanks, Mom, I take an SNRI and keep ending up with head exhaustion when I work in the backyard 🥵"
63988,"thank you, mama :)"
63989,Thanks mom.
63990,"wow, I did not know that."
63991,"thanks, mom."
63992,thank you so much for telling me
63993,I had no idea.
63994,Thank you so much for sharing.
63995,....I did not know this...
63996,Thank you!
63997,This explains a lot about this summer omg
63998,That makes so much sense.
63999,I'm getting dehydrated so much faster
64000,<3
64001,Thanks for the heads-up because I couldn’t understand why this year the heat is making me feel particularly crappy.
64002,"Paroxetine belongs in this group too, apparently."
64003,Thanks mom!
64004,I didn't know why I was struggling with heat this summer and wondering why
64005,Just another person you've reached that didn't know this!
64006,Thank you!
64007,I didn’t know this!
64008,Thank you 🥰
64009,You are hero.
64010,:)
64011,During the recent heatwave in the UK I couldn't seem to drink enough.
64012,I felt really dehydrated and had a headache every day.
64013,I didn't know this about my medication.
64014,Thank you for posting!
64015,Does Cymbalta fall under this rubric?
64016,Edit: it does!
64017,Duloxetine is the generic name.
64018,TIL’d.
64019,"Thanks, mom!"
64020,"Oh, this is good to know."
64021,Luckily I am mostly staying inside and when I'm outside I stay in the shade because I'm not built for this heat.
64022,"Tricyclics are similar, they affect the past of your brain that controls body temperature, and stop you from sweating enough to cool yourself properly."
64023,"Can anyone let me know if this includes Escitalopram, Clonazepam, and/or lithium hcl?"
64024,Suddenly SO MUCH MAKES SENSE!!!
64025,"Thanks, Mom"
64026,"Oh wow, thank you momma!"
64027,I did not know this!
64028,"whoa didn’t know this, thank you Muma !"
64029,!
64030,"Damn, thanks mom, that explains a lot."
64031,I’ve been taking mirtazipine for years now and I’m very prone to overheating during hikes.
64032,I’m going on a hike with dad in 30 minutes.
64033,He never really understood my mental health struggles.
64034,I actually had no idea!!!
64035,Thank you for sharing!!
64036,!
64037,No wonder I'm always hot all the time!!!
64038,I never knew this.
64039,Thank you ♥️
64040,Oh this explains so much for the past 8 years
64041,"i can't find anything about that anywhere, where do you know this from?"
64042,:/
64043,I had no idea!
64044,I take sertraline- thanks for educating me
64045,Thanks mom 🥰.
64046,I had no idea!
64047,Citalopram gave me a really dry mouth and I’m sure it’s what triggered all my neurological issues.
64048,Thanks mom!
64049,Now I know I’m EXTRA prone to overheating!
64050,Makes a lot of sense actually XD I’d thought my tolerance for heat was even lower than usual.
64051,"Appreciate you saying this, I had no idea!"
64052,"Thanks, mom <3"
64053,Thank you!
64054,Thanks for the reminder Ma!
64055,Good info from a truly gentle and caring heart ❤️.
64056,Sending you a big hug!
64057,Thanks so much for this heads up!
64058,Thank you Mama 💕 I didn’t know this but will take your warning as it’s very hot here.
64059,"Thanks, Ma"
64060,Thank you so much mom!!
64061,I have been on sertraline for years and never knew this!
64062,!
64063,That would explain why I've been miserable any time I go our.
64064,I just started cymbalta a month ago and now any time I'm out in the heat I feel absolutely miserable after.
64065,Even if I keep to the shade or wear layers to avoid the sun.
64066,I thought I've been more thirsty than usual.
64067,This Florida heat is no joke.
64068,Thanks for the heads up
64069,Oh is that why I’ve thrown up and almost passed out twice this summer?
64070,Thank you!
64071,"Ohhhhhhhhhh, that makes a LOT of sense!"
64072,Thanks mom!
64073,"I had no idea this was a thing, I take sertraline!"
64074,Thank you so much for the advice !
64075,"ohhhh, well, that explains the headaches that I've got during the hot weather."
64076,"Wow, did not know this."
64077,Thank you!
64078,I'm taking mirtazapin and no one told me about it.
64079,Thanks a lot!
64080,"I'd never even thought about this, but I do overheat really easily and I've been on one of these medications since I was nine...
Good to know!"
64081,"Thank you for the reminder, mom."
64082,I love you..
64083,"Reading this as I lay on my bed, surrounded by ice packs, resting after 4 hours of grueling yard work in 109 F degree temperatures."
64084,"I figured once I almost threw up, I should probably cool off for awhile."
64085,Good thing I missed my Zoloft this morning.
64086,I had NO idea I was more prone to overheating.
64087,I’m grateful for the lesson and the love!
64088,Just a quick note that if you take adhd medication that can count
64089,"I did not know this, but it makes total sense."
64090,Thanks for the tip!
64091,[removed]
64092,I love liquid iv.
64093,It's good for people who get issues with electrolytes.
64094,"My wife and I make a mix of that and a crystal lite with caffeine for a ""potion"" - because if it's a caffeine headache that's sorted, and if it's electrolytes or water that's sorted too!"
64095,Lol.
64096,(strawberry liquid iv plus strawberry caffeine crystal lite tastes like a strawberry shortcake with cream also so that's awesome)
64097,This is the second day on a row that I’ve heard about liquid IV.
64098,I am def getting this stuff.
64099,"Yeah , I feel like this just answered a lot of questions about me."
64100,I feel you so hard on this
64101,"Same, but with the added fun of perimenopause hot flashes."
64102,No wonder I’m always dripping in sweat.
64103,I’m with you
64104,Without a doubt the most miserable medication I've ever been on.
64105,"I was always so hot, burning up, sweating."
64106,Sleeping was impossible.
64107,Bluh.
64108,"Woah, I’ve been on Effexor for years and didn’t realize this was a common side effect, I seriously thought it was a pre menopausal issue due to my age, I feel stupid but thankful for knowing this now!"
64109,"Just wanted to add, I did NOT know this about my SSRI...mind blown because I wondered why I was struggling so much."
64110,This is my first summer on an SSRI along with being on **hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure**.
64111,That drug makes me photosensitive as well and more likely to burn.
64112,"Some days my sun hat, sun shawl, sunscreen and remaining really well hydrated are just not enough."
64113,"Edit: Thank you for posting u/Miss_squid_tickler, I've been struggling so much this summer and this gives me a major answer to talk about with my doctor."
64114,"Yeah, sertraline has made summers just brutal."
64115,"Dude I used to be a like, very occasional sweaty person, like I could chill at 100° and be a little hot but fine… the last few years I’ve been sweating through shirts, the back of my neck is always soaked - I’d convinced myself I’m heading for early menopause (I’m 36 lol) but now I’m like o.0 

On sertraline and bupropion both and things make so much sense reading these comments, like seriously wtf"
64116,"I don't know how helpful any of this is if you're outside the United States, but I've had good luck with Hydrapeak (which claims 24 hours cold and 12 hot)."
64117,"I have not tried it with hot beverages, but I'd say the cold claim is accurate (and this is with being left in a hot car on hot days when I run errands)."
64118,"If you can easily get to a TJ MAXX they often seem to have some in stock, but the site (hydrapeak.com) does free shipping over $10."
64119,Yep I take Duloxetine with Gabapentin and I sweat the moment I step outside lol.
64120,More sensitive to sunburns too!
64121,!
64122,"Clonazepam: does list dehydration 

https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14403-4005/clonazepam-oral/clonazepam-disintegrating-tablet-oral/details/list-sideeffects

Escitalopr does list increased sweating and dehydration 

https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14403-4005/clonazepam-oral/clonazepam-disintegrating-tablet-oral/details/list-sideeffects

Yes."
64123,"Lithium does have an effect on body temp, ability to regulate ect."
64124,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/580155/
64125,Are you ok?
64126,They do make an energy one of the liquid IV!
64127,"Nothing wrong with the potion either I just really like the flavor, it's this horrendously green refreshing ginger lemon flavor."
64128,You won't regret it!
64129,It's amazing stuff.
64130,"Great for working out, hangovers, and any kinda general dehydration."
64131,"If you do Costco, that's where I've found the best prices on it."
64132,"I’m lucky in that it works well for me otherwise and I was previously very un-sweaty and heat-tolerant, so “way more than normal” for me is more like… just normal."
64133,"Except for the night sweats, which are gross."
64134,I'm glad you were able to learn something.
64135,Use this to talk to your doctor about ways to help you stay safe or recognize signs of heat stroke/exhaustion
64136,😩😩
64137,"That's awesome, thanks so much for this!"
64138,I really appreciate it.

64140,Thank you!
64141,if u really wanna know then no im not if ur asking to be polite then yes im amazing never been better
64142,"Yea but I have to be in the mood for the ginger lemon matcha flavor though, cuz sometimes the tea is just too bitter."
64143,"Plus for some reason, it doesn't mix into the water as well so I end up with little rocks of tea at the bottom."
64144,I suffer from migraines and IIH  and sometimes I’m so sick I can barley get a pedialyte down.
64145,So I’m totally giving this a shot!
64146,"https://www.liquid-iv.com/

Is this what you’re using"
64147,Same!
64148,I only sweat when I dream on it though.
64149,"Mineral sunscreens, big hats, linen clothes with a upf wrap or cardigan, and a big insulated bottle of hydration drink are my coping mechanisms."
64150,(Chemical sunscreens heat up just a little more than mineral ones but it's enough of a difference for me to notice.)
64151,"I'll even use an umbrella if I'm going to be out and about long enough, portable shade is priceless."
64152,"No, I really wanted to know."
64153,Your post was troubling.
64154,I looked at your post history out of curiosity.
64155,This random internet person is concerned for your well-being.
64156,I have a 13 year old and it breaks my heart to think of anyone at such a young age feeling as you do.
64157,"Idk, I don't know how I could really help a stranger, but I just want to let you know you're not as alone as you may think."
64158,That's it!
64159,"That might be the case for me too, I’m not sure."
64160,"Thing is, the Effexor also gives me more dreams/more vivid dreams as well."
64161,Oh alright well im horrible then but oh well
64162,thanks and i hope u and ur kid have a good life
64163,Thank you.
64164,Just ordered!

64180,Lol.
64181,I needed it after these few days.
64182,😫
64183,what does it feel like
64184,It’s a nice little head high.
64185,It gets your mind off things.

64191,"Oh wow, I feel old."
64192,My students were as old as you last year.
64193,😂 you still have so much ahead of you and so much to do!
64194,Keep living and keep shining!
64195,Whatever it is that has got you down is just a crack in the road.
64196,Keep moving.
64197,You’ve got this!
64198,💕
64199,"The addition of emojis and exclamation marks leads me to believe that was the end of thiis conversation, but I will leave you with the fact that u prolly arent that old"
64200,"Haha, I’m 33, lol, I’m 20 year older than you."
64201,I feel wicked old.
64202,No we can keep talking.

64210,is that a conversation ending message?
64211,No?
64212,But you can DM me?
64213,😊
64214,okie
64215,I’m going to wear it.
64216,Wear the dress.
64217,It's just a piece of fabric that you've assigned meaning.
64218,"That's wonderful and beautiful, but there's no reason you can't assign additional meaning, like honoring her memory by wearing it to a family function."
64219,"No one but you needs to know, and if anyone says anything, you can always say with a calm shrug, ""It's just a dress"", because that's all it is, unless you say otherwise."
64220,🤗💙
64221,"Like PP said, it's just fabric, but I understand that it's more than that to you."
64222,Wear it so it's like your daughter is there with you.
64223,Wear it fashionably so that she'd thumbs up your outfit.
64224,"Wear it so that you can proudly say to yourself that you survived the worst imaginable thing, and you're whole and well enough to celebrate a loved one on a special day."
64225,I'm so sorry for your loss.
64226,I hope the wedding is wonderful.
64227,Wear it.
64228,It's like she's joining you in some small way.
64229,"I'm so sorry about your daughter 😪❤️ 

I think the only consideration is how you feel wearing it."
64230,"If, when you wear it, you feel sadder, or more grief, don't wear it."
64231,"A wedding is a time of new beginnings, and should be a happy occasion 

If you feel ok with it on, then by all means wear it."
64232,I wore my favourite black dress to my mum's funeral a decade ago.
64233,I've worn it many times before and since.
64234,"It doesn't remind me of her funeral, so I'm happy to wear it."
64235,It's just a dress.
64236,"Whatever you decide,  I'm sending you fellow mum hugs if you'll accept them."
64237,Please chose what's right for you ❤️
64238,From another mother of loss...
64239,Yes.
64240,You can.
64241,She would want you to.
64242,"That way, she's coming to the wedding, too."
64243,😍
64244,I would absolutely wear it and enjoy yourself!
64245,If you want to wear the dress then wear it.
64246,It wouldn't be disrespectful at all.
64247,BUT only wear it if you are happy in the dress.
64248,If it makes you sad I'd probably pass.
64249,I promise though that it wouldnt frowned upon.
64250,Wear the dress; you’ll be bringing a bit of your daughter with you to the wedding.
64251,You know she’d tell you to go for it Mom!
64252,Wear the dress sweetly.
64253,"If it helps, think of it this way: you bought the dress because you knew your daughter would like it."
64254,"By wearing it to the wedding, you’re bringing her with you."
64255,"Honestly, if it doesn't upset you to wear it and it's wedding appropriate.... wear it."
64256,"At the end of the day, it's just a dress."
64257,I imagine she would want you to wear it.
64258,"(And I don't know if your concern is along the lines of ""omg will people say something about me wearing the same dress at my daughter's funeral?"""
64259,"And no, no they won't"
64260,They don't make rules for things like that.
64261,Rock that dress and bring a little piece of her memory to a family celebration.
64262,"You know she would want to to look amazing, feel great and have a fabulous time!"
64263,"I would, but with an accessory like a scarf or brooch that I wouldn't have worn to the funeral."
64264,I still have the dress that I wore to my daughters funeral to.
64265,"It’s unlikely anyone would remember what I wore to her funeral, we certainly could pose for pictures."
64266,"I haven’t worn mine again, yet."
64267,But it’s still beautiful and I still like it!
64268,You should absolutely wear the dress and love your daughter in your heart the whole day knowing that you’re wearing a piece of her history
64269,"I think because of the emotional connection, that not only is the dress needing to be worn, but also you'll carry her memory extra close to you while wearing it, and that's extra special."
64270,"Wear the dress, maybe she's speaking to you (if you believe this kind of thing) and asking you to feel special, a gift from her."
64271,❤️
64272,Absolutely.
64273,"If it’s appropriate, wear it."
64274,Her fashion forward mind would have loved that.
64275,And it’s honouring too.
64276,Go for it.
64277,My condolences on your loss xx
64278,Yes!
64279,Wear it!
64280,Bring your baby girl with you to the wedding and dance the night away in her memory.
64281,I feel like by wearing it you’re bringing a piece of your daughter to your nephews wedding.
64282,I think that’s 100% perfect.
64283,Have a wonderful time.
64284,Wear the dress.
64285,"You know she’d have loved to have seen you wearing it, and it’s a way that she can still be there with you."
64286,"If you look good in the dress, and you feel good in it, go for it."
64287,I'm so proud of you for taking care of yourself.
64288,How you feel is the most important thing in any situation.
64289,"I would wear it, since it would also mean she is also there with you celebrating the occasion!"
64290,You should absolutely wear it.
64291,We had a very informal picnic/memorial party for my son when he died.
64292,I wear the dress all the time.
64293,"Honestly I would wear the dresses more, you bought them to honour her memory, so honour her."
64294,"Wear them, live in them, make happy memories in them that you can cherish and remember her by."
64295,"If you were my mum I would tell you that I love you and to just be happy, wear the expensive dresses and do the things you love."
64296,The only meaning anything can have is the meaning a person gives it.
64297,"It’s your dress, so you get to choose the meaning."
64298,If anything wearing something that reminds you of your daughter is a sign of love on a special day in my eyes.
64299,Wear it!
64300,I wear my dad’s flannel shirts all the time.
64301,"His bday is coming up in a few weeks, just as the weather is getting colder."
64302,"I wear them at home, I sleep in them, I wear them as a jacket."
64303,To me it is honoring his memory and keeping him close.
64304,It’s been 10 yrs.
64305,Yes.
64306,And remember her with love.
64307,she will be happy knowing you are showing up in style while keeping her with you for a family event 🤍
64308,Yesssss ❤️
64309,Yes.
64310,To honour the wedding and the memory - all good.
64311,"If your daughter loved fashion, I bet she’d love that you’re wearing it."
64312,"You wore it to show her your love at her funeral, and now you’re showing love to someone else."
64313,All while showing love to yourself by dressing up!
64314,It’s a great way to honor her and have her there with you.
64315,I have a feeling she would want you to wear it.
64316,I know I would.
64317,Sending love!
64318,"If you were my mom, I’d want you to wear the nice dresses you bought to happy occasions, and remember me there with love."
64319,"Not a mom, but hopefully an encouraging sis…

Your daughter sounds like a beautiful person."
64320,I’m sure she would love for you to wear that dress and feel beautiful in it.
64321,She would wasn’t you to build happy memories and always remember her as well.
64322,I like to think that she's there with you tomorrow ❤️ wear that dress proudly.
64323,I wish you all the best and so much love for your beautiful departed baby 🫂
64324,Wear it.
64325,I'd want my mom to wear whatever makes her feel her best.
64326,I'm in your nephew's position: my cousin died unexpectedly years before I got married.
64327,One of my few regrets in life is that he wasn't there to dance at my wedding.
64328,I'd have been *delighted* to hear that my aunt was doing this!
64329,"I hope you have a wonderful time, Aunty."
64330,Daughter for a minute: as your daughter I want you to look and feel great about yourself.
64331,I love you unconditionally and if it’s fashionable — even better.
64332,Daughters want to see their moms looking and feeling good and you deserve it 💕💕
64333,When you wear that dress your daughter will be looking down from heaven smiling at you.
64334,You are honoring her memory.
64335,You are also taking something that was once sad and turning into a memorable and joyous memory!
64336,"❣️

She would be proud of you!"
64337,We are all proud of you!
64338,"Be happy, healthy and loved unconditionally!"
64339,"💞

May the wedding be a great time and I am sending you lots of love!"
64340,Xoxo from all of US!
64341,💕💕💕
64342,I think that would be a great thing to do!
64343,"As you said, the dress is appropriate."
64344,And I bet it’s beautiful.
64345,"Not a mom, but I lost a parent in the last 2010s."
64346,I have a piece of jewelry of theirs that is incredibly significant to me ($0 real value).
64347,Sometimes I wear it so that they can be with me.
64348,It might be a time I know I’ll need comfort.
64349,It might be that I want them to “experience” the place I’m going.
64350,"It may seem silly to some, but it’s been a wonderful thing to me."
64351,"I’m sorry you went through that (still are, I know)."
64352,I got here after your edit.
64353,I agree she’d love for you to look and feel your best!
64354,Whatever you choose- it’s okay and appropriate.
64355,I wish you the best!
64356,It's really up to how you feel.
64357,"I tried to wear the dress I wore to my father's funeral, to a company Christmas party, and it just felt wrong."
64358,I donated it to charity.
64359,"But if you want to do it, go for it."
64360,I wore the dress I bought for and wore to my mom’s funeral to a wedding about three years later.
64361,It was my aunt’s/ cousin’s idea and they thought it was a beautiful dress and deserved to be worn again.
64362,Wear the dress hunny.
64363,Nobody will notice.
64364,It'd be a shame to never wear something so beautiful again.
64365,I'm sure your daughter would say the same xxx
64366,I’m so good you decided to wear it.
64367,Your daughter will be right there with you in spirit.
64368,She would be so proud to know that you are allowing yourself to feel beautiful.
64369,I hope that the wedding is wonderful tomorrow.
64370,Sending Lots of love and hugs your way ❤️❤️❤️
64371,I am so sorry for your terrible loss.
64372,I'm a daughter.
64373,"I would love my mother to celebrate life, looking and feeling good."
64374,My spirit would be with her.
64375,I'm a Mom of a daughter.
64376,She would love for me to do as you wish.
64377,I hope you have a fabulous time!
64378,I think it's a beautiful way to give a dress a new memory.
64379,I wore the dress that I wore to my brother's funeral years ago to my other brother's wedding recently and the connection brought me comfort in a weird way.
64380,I would definitely wear it if you feel comfortable in it!
64381,Yes you can.
64382,"I lost my son a few yrs ago, and still have that beautiful dress I wore for his."
64383,Yes Momma.
64384,You can.
64385,"You have ALL of our permission, not that you need it."
64386,Love to you.
64387,"Yes, of course."
64388,I'm so sorry for your loss.
64389,"Wear that dress as an honor to your daughter, she would want you to wear it."
64390,Wear it.
64391,Take your beautiful daughter with you to the wedding.
64392,"Dance for her in it,  strut in it,  shine in it."
64393,Let the dress embrace like a hug.
64394,I hope you have a wonderful time.
64395,I'll be you were a wonderful mother.
64396,Think about it as bringing the memory of your daughter to the family wedding ❤️ I think she would want you to wear it if you feel beautiful and peaceful in the dress.
64397,Wear the dress and celebrate.
64398,"Remember how much your daughter loved fashion, that it brought joy to her life."
64399,And share the feeling of that joy with your nephew
64400,Of course you can.
64401,"Wearing the dress to special occasions because you feel good in it seems like such a lovely way to honour your daughter, considering what you said in the edit."
64402,"If anyone does question it, which I doubt anyone will, say what you said here."
64403,I think it gives you all the more reason for wearing the dress.
64404,"I’m so sorry for your loss, I say wear it."
64405,Came in late and read your eta: yes!
64406,Wear the dress!
64407,I am so sorry 🥺💜💜
64408,It’ll be a little bit like she’s with you I hope.
64409,Wear the dress and feel beautiful - you are so strong.
64410,I hope you are happy seeing your nephew married.
64411,I think she would want you to.
64412,"Maybe say something like ""they've been sitting in your closet long enough!""."
64413,"I'm sorry for your loss, I hope you're healing."
64414,Yes!
64415,It's just clothes
64416,This thread is so wholesome.
64417,"OP, I think you are incredible and I wish I had a mother like you."
64418,Your daughter would want you to enjoy the dress and feel beautiful.
64419,I hope the wedding is wonderful and you feel your daughter is with you.
64420,❤️
64421,Wear the dress.
64422,"As a daughter, I would be so happy my momma is wearing a fashionable dress she bought in my honor to a joyous occasion."
64423,🥰
64424,Does it still fit?
64425,Wear it.
64426,It’s OK. I’m sorry about your loss.
64427,Truly.
64428,I think it would be lovely to where it again to something special and have it your special little secret to know it is also in honour of her memory!
64429,💕💜
64430,You bought the dress bc your daughter would have liked it.
64431,"She would have wanted you to wear it, so do."
64432,"An alternative “this way she’s here with us too”, because it sure sounds like she’s still with you in these dresses."
64433,"Even if they had the initial purpose of mourning, it was because you were honoring her and I think it’s more than appropriate to wear that same dress."
64434,This post makes me want to hug my mom.
64435,I would want my mama to feel beautiful and not have to spend more $ on a new dress.
64436,And it’s like I would be there with her.
64437,That dress would be my dress too so we will attend together in spirit.
64438,I would be so happy for my mama to attach joyful memories to that dress and I would be watching her loving how beautiful she looks in it.
64439,❤️
64440,"I love that you have a chance to associate a happy memory with this dress,  your daughter would support this 100% as any of us, as daughters, would hope for our own moms if us."
64441,May you have a lovely day!
64442,"The idea of you buying two new, fashionable  dresses as one more way to honor your daughter made me tear up."
64443,What a lovely and subtle gesture.
64444,You can wear anything you want???
64445,I don't see what's stopping you
64446,You absolutely can and I doubt anyone will even remember the dress you are wearing was for your daughter's funeral!
64447,"That being said, if you think there is a possibility that *you* might unexpectedly be triggered while wearing the dress...

 Maybe save it for a different event to test out."
64448,"I haven't lost a child (I only have the one 11 year old son and I super hope he outlives me), but I have lost a sister who was 12 when I was 14  and to this day (I am 34) I have small triggers around the weirdest/smallest things."
64449,"Not at all to make this about me, just thinking about if she was my daughter I might randomly get very emotional over the dress and where I wore it/why I bought it."
64450,"I wouldn't want to risk having one of my ""flashbacks to the moment associated with the item"" on someone else's day that is supposed to be their happiest memory."
64451,Absolutely wear the dress!
64452,"If you were my mom, I would have felt so happy my mom looked beautiful."
64453,"I think it's lovely that you bought a nice dress or two to go out your daughter, and that you're wearing them again."
64454,I'd be touched.
64455,It's almost like you're talking your daughter to your nephew's wedding.
64456,Wear it.
64457,Accessorize and change the energy if you like.
64458,"You got it to honor her style, now you get to celebrate her."
64459,"If anyone asks or notices, just say it was time to wear it for a happy occasion."
64460,I hope you have a fabulous time 💜
64461,I'm glad you decided to wear the dress.
64462,I don't think it's at all disrespectful to her memory.
64463,"My bet is your daughter was in your ear, from wherever she is now, telling you, ""Mom, it's a beautiful dress."
64464,It's okay to wear it to the wedding.
64465,"You'll look amazing, as you should."""
64466,<3
64467,"This question made me laugh 😂😮‍💨 I know I shouldn’t find humor in this, but…."
64468,I’m feeling a lil morbid today
64469,"High quality, classic dress, that still fits you 10 years later?!"
64470,Wear it as often as you can.
64471,"A beautiful, appropriate dress that is a very special garment to you for personal reasons?"
64472,"Hell yeah, wear it."
64473,"I'm sorry about your loss, hope you're doing ok and have a fab time at the upcoming wedding x"
64474,I'm so happy.
64475,And your daughter would be happy too.
64476,Please accept all my condolences on the loss of your beautiful child.
64477,Sending hugs and love.
64478,"I hope wearing this dress will be healing for you, too."
64479,Good.
64480,"As a daughter, all I would want is for my mom to be happy, feel beautiful and NOT feel guilty about either."
64481,Betting a million yours would feel the same 💛
64482,"From a daughter, thinking about if my poor mama had to hold my funeral, if she'd worn such a special dress for that occasion, I would be absolutely thrilled and also relieved if she later felt ready to wear it again and find a little joy in it!"
64483,This helped me want to my wear suit that I haven't since my mom's funeral.
64484,Thank you.
64485,I think it’s like she gets to be there with you.
64486,What’s better than that?
64487,Yay!
64488,It’s like she gets to go too.
64489,"You said she was fashionable, and so this is like her dressing you for the occasion and it’s a part of her going."
64490,I think this is the right choice.
64491,I never knew your daughter but I think she would be happy that you're giving the dress a positive memory.
64492,My son died a few months ago (very different circumstances).
64493,I wore a nice outfit that I already owned because I couldn't face the thought of buying anything at the time (I struggle with buying clothes at the best of times!!)
64494,"It's been a struggle to wear the outfit since but I've made myself do it a couple of times because I don't want it to forever be That Outfit, you know?"
64495,I hope you enjoy the wedding.
64496,Good for you!
64497,❤️❤️❤️
64498,Your daughter would be really happy because you are happy

64502,Honoring her memory.
64503,Thank you.
64504,Hugs .
64505,I love this reply
64506,I wear a ring that was made out of a piece of my grandmother's silverware to every big family event.
64507,It makes me feel like I'm helping her be a part of those events.
64508,"If you want, you can add a scarf or something different on your attire to give it new look."
64509,All the best ❤️
64510,She’d be proud of her old ma.
64511,Thank you!
64512,❤️
64513,This is lovely.
64514,xxx
64515,Thanks.
64516,She was the only granddaughter.
64517,I think it will be a little homage that maybe no one else will know about.
64518,Like our little secret.
64519,❤️😢
64520,Will do!
64521,❤️
64522,She would approve.
64523,Thank you!
64524,I didn’t wear any accessories at her funeral.
64525,I bought a belt and shrug to wear this time.
64526,I’m sorry for the loss of your daughter.
64527,We are part of a club no one wants to join.
64528,Will you ever wear that dress again?
64529,💕
64530,She was such a fashion maven.
64531,I had to represent in the best possible way for her.
64532,I think she would be happy.
64533,❤️
64534,I love that you love your mom that much!
64535,You’re a fabulous daughter.
64536,Your mama is lucky to have you.
64537,Exactly this - you'll be bringing your daughter with you.
64538,I’m so sorry for your loss.
64539,❤️ It sucks.
64540,I still have the dress I wore when my daughter died.
64541,I haven't worn it again but I would.
64542,"Of course Ducks, we love you so much and we're so proud of you."
64543,Honestly I think that's a beautiful way to have your daughter with you at a time meant for family.
64544,"Seems like a lovely way to have her at the wedding, and a dress she would have loved to see you in."
64545,And as opposed to seeing it as the 'Funeral dress' reframe it - a dress you brought in honour of your daughters style.
64546,Shed definitely wasn't you to wear it x
64547,"Most people don’t expect wedding guests to buy a whole new outfit for their wedding, it’s completely fine to rewear that dress as long as its appropriate for their dress code."
64548,"I doubt anyone would even remember what you wore 10 years ago, but it can definitely be a way to honor her memory."
64549,Hugs right back!
64550,🦆🤓
64551,I think that's beautiful.
64552,"And that you specifically chose it because your daughter loved fashion puts an extra layer of love into it

For me, personally,  love and kindness are the two most important things in the world."
64553,"We'll keep your secret 🙂 I hope you have a great time at the wedding,  and wish the happy couple a successful and loving future together"
64554,I love that!
64555,It’s a beautiful way to honor her and I’m glad you’ve decided to wear the dress.
64556,"What was her name, if you'd like to share?"
64557,Mine was named Cambridge Shea.
64558,I'm sure she's looking down in approval.
64559,I'm glad you're using this to remember her.
64560,I'm also sorry for your loss.
64561,Still.
64562,"Of course, always."
64563,I really don’t know if I will.
64564,I was also don’t want to get rid of it.
64565,It’s been 7 1/2 years and it still feels weird and wrong.
64566,The worst club ever
64567,Thank you.
64568,Yes it does.
64569,I still have the sweater I wore when I held her when she died.
64570,I’ve worn it a lot.
64571,Gives me comfort.
64572,❤️
64573,I was thinking this exact same thing.
64574,"In fact, wear it more often in her memory!"
64575,Mateja June
64576,It would take extreme circumstances for me to feel telling a parent *how* to grieve (or not) their child is appropriate.
64577,"Whatever you do, it's about yourself and your journey and no one's business but your own."
64578,I think the only person you might consider might be what would have been your daughters opinion?
64579,"But even then, know that grieving is personal and not always rational."
64580,That's so lovely.
64581,I wear the earrings she had on.
64582,I put them in a necklace I wear often.
64583,It's like a little hug from her every time I do.
64584,Beautiful.
64585,🥰 I'll ask my daughter to find her and to hug each other.
64586,<3
64587,Just wanted to say huge hugs for you both.
64588,Also will squeeze my children a little tighter tonight for you both.
64589,Much love
64590,I’m so glad glad you have a living and supportive person in your life.
64591,I hope you feel lighter and happier today.
64592,Big hugs to you both - you are so good for each other 💙
64593,You are living proof that life can get better.
64594,Love your love.
64595,X
64596,I'm so sorry that you had to experience that violation.
64597,Nobody should experience that.
64598,You deserve the love your partner is showing you right now!
64599,"You and your partner deserve the best from each other, and the absolute best from the world"
64600,I'm so sorry that that was done to you.
64601,"It wasn't something that happened to you, it was done to you."
64602,"You were then, and are now utterly blameless."
64603,"It was never your fault, and there was nothing you did that made you 'deserve' it."
64604,There is nothing that could make you 'deserve' it.
64605,"FYI, virginity is a social construct."
64606,#VirginUntilYes
64607,"Your girlfriend sounds amazing, and I’m so glad you were able to be honest with her."
64608,I wanted to make sure I added one more thing that is important for you to hear: what happened was not your fault.
64609,"Sweetheart, I’m proud of you for having the courage to trust in her."
64610,You deserve all best things life has to offer and it sounds like you found one of them in her.
64611,"Hugs to you both, momma"
64612,"That's a beautiful connection right there, I'm very happy for you, love 💕 I'm sorry that happened to you but I'm glad you have someone who doesn't make you feel bad about it and instead supports you emotionally!"
64613,💕
64614,Sorry you had to go through that and glad you have a compassionate companion in your life
64615,I am so sorry you went through that as a child.
64616,Your girlfriend's love is hopefully part of your healing.
64617,"Bless her, and Hugs."
64618,I am so sorry that was done to you.
64619,"I’m so sorry that something made you worry she would not believe you, be it someone’s negative reaction in the past, or society’s ugly habit of blaming or disbelieving victims."
64620,"I’be been in your girlfriend’s place before, hearing about a traumatic violation of someone I love."
64621,"If she’s anything like me she was probably worried that she didn’t know what to say to make you feel better, and so grateful that you loved and trusted her enough to tell her."
64622,"I can pretty much guarantee that she never though you were lying at all, does not think it was your fault at all (no matter the circumstances) and it did NOT change how she sees you, unless it was to realize that you’ve had to be even stronger than she knew."
64623,"If you get a chance, it’ll probably make her feel good if you tell her what her reaction meant to you, and that it was what you needed."
64624,Or maybe just show her this post.
64625,She might worry she didn’t say the right thing or react the way you needed and this will give her that assurance.
64626,My girlfriend got really sad and didn't know how to react when I told her I was sexually assaulted by a maid when I was 7.
64627,I thought my girlfriend wouldn't take me seriously and laugh it off but it actually made her feel sad.
64628,I didn't expect her to get affected by it and I felt cared for the first time ever.
64629,We never spoke about it after that though.
64630,She was just really quiet and told me she needed time to process it.
64631,I was always laughed at when I told past girl friends of real emotional things.... Count your stars my friend.
64632,You found the one.
64633,She’s a keeper.
64634,"Lots of healing to you, son."
64635,❤️‍🩹
64636,I'm so glad you have someone that you can share that with.
64637,Especially as a man it is difficult to be able to confide in people about sexual abuse.
64638,I'm so happy for you that she was respectful and supportive.
64639,"I'm so sorry that happened to you, and I hope you have a beautiful life together."
64640,I’m really happy you have someone like your girlfriend to listen to and support you!
64641,There’s also an online community called [1in6](https://1in6.org).
64642,They are a support group specifically for men and boys that have been victims of sexual abuse.
64643,Some times it can be nice to have more than one place to turn to when you want to talk!
64644,Keep taking care of yourself.
64645,You deserve the effort.
64646,I’m sorry.
64647,I’m so sorry.
64648,"If you need to talk, I’m here."
64649,It’s when we keep secrets that shame eats away at us.
64650,You did the right thing in telling her.
64651,I’m so happy you found support when you needed it most.
64652,She sounds wonderful.
64653,{{{{{{{{soft warm hugs}}}}}}}}
64654,"I'm not a mom, but I'm sending you love and hugs 💕"
64655,"So.. question from a sib, how did you do it?"
64656,Just straight to her or did you work up to it online or otherwise somehow?
64657,Good job!
64658,That was very brave.
64659,"It paid off, your girlfriend sounds lovely"
64660,It’s great that you’ve found someone who makes you feel safe enough to talk about it.
64661,Someone who you can trust enough to respect your triggers and traumas.
64662,I’m so sorry it happened and I hope you’re okay.
64663,I’m glad you have someone with whom you can discuss it and no longer have to hold the burden of a secret
64664,"Hey brother, little sister here."
64665,"I was molested and I am so, so sorry this happened."
64666,It’s a heartache few truly understand.
64667,But this lady loves you!
64668,And she is now clearly there for you.
64669,"Wishing both of you the best, bud, love you."
64670,Just thought to give you my free award :))
64671,"First, sorry you had to go through that as a child."
64672,No one should have to go through that kind of experience.
64673,You found a keeper.
64674,"She's shown you she was trustworthy to talk to, and how she reacted just proved your gut right."
64675,Having a supportive partner in life is an amazing thing.
64676,Congratulations.
64677,I hope you have many happy years to come.
64678,❤️i hope you are doing well❤️
64679,I’m so happy that you have found love and understanding.
64680,She sounds like a wonderful person and you deserve love like the love she is giving you.
64681,"This is beautiful, this makes me happy to be apart of humanity.."
64682,This is what It means to be human!
64683,Pure love !
64684,You guys are definitely going to last no doubt about it.
64685,When my girlfriend told me about her story it was over text becuase we’re long distance but I also geared up a little becuase it’s so heart breaking.. She told me that she didnt feel bad about it anymore and wasn’t effected but I always wonder if it’s true…
64686,"Thanks, I have always struggled with this absurd (to me) concept of virginity."
64687,What is there to remember if it was forced?
64688,"Still, I get asked about my 'first time,' and still it is an open  wound that no amount of work or therapy takes away."
64689,I am not sad.
64690,I rage.
64691,Against the opression we face if we did not have a choice.
64692,Even after a: yes!
64693,It doesn't magically go away.
64694,It stays.
64695,"I've never heard of ""virgin until yes"" but I wholeheartedly agree"
64696,Did you wish to speak more about it?
64697,"I wouldn't bring it up if you didn't tbh, but is that the wrong move?"
64698,What would your 'ideal' handling of this from a partner look like?
64699,That sucks.
64700,I'm sorry they did that to you.
64701,Nobody should laugh at someone who is brave enough to be vulnerable.
64702,Yeah they sound like assholes.
64703,You deserve better
64704,I'm sorry you were treated that way in the past by people who were supposed to be partners.
64705,You should count your blessings and be proud of yourself for not remaining in those toxic relationships.
64706,Came here to add this; so happy to see someone already posted it.
64707,"OP, you are so brave, and I’m so happy to see that your courage was rewarded."
64708,"Trust is a major part of a relationship’s foundation AND a major part of healing, so this was a big moment."
64709,Please accept this huge (HUG).
64710,Exactly my thoughts.
64711,I’m sorry for that abuse you went through and I wish you healing.
64712,But also—don’t let this girlfriend go!
64713,She is amazing.
64714,"Sister here, I just wanted to say that you put this feeling into words for me better than I've been able to."
64715,It's like a not fully healed scab being picked off any time someone asks.
64716,I'm so sorry for what was done to you.
64717,Your first time is the first time you wanted it.
64718,It's a milestone in your life.
64719,"If a baby bird gets pushed from the nest, that doesn't count as its first flight."
64720,The first flight is when it spreads its wings and flies on its own.
64721,I gotta remember the scabs comparison for the next time I try to explain this stuff to loved ones.
64722,honestly i would be 10000% delighted if someone gave me something like that as a gift!
64723,they look awesome.
64724,"If anyone was wondering what we made, it was:

Cupcakes, half vanilla and half are lemon flavoured
Iced shortbread biscuits 
Chocolate bark (one with pretzels and one with popping candy and dried berries)
Sausage rolls
Cheese twists 
And the boxes have little candies and decorations

Total cost maybe £50 for all ingredients and packaging, my partners patience with my anxiety is priceless.. as is all your comments of praise."
64725,It means the world.
64726,So much love and effort went into these!
64727,"To me, these are far better than anything you could have purchased at a store."
64728,What a beautiful gesture.
64729,Let me tell you something.
64730,"In my family, I am the baker."
64731,"I bake cakes for everyone, for all occasions."
64732,But that means for my own birthday the cake is usually an afterthought.
64733,One year my two sisters got together and baked me a cake.
64734,"To them, it wasn't the prettiest or the fanciest, but to me, so many yeats later, I still remember it as one of my favorite gifts ever."
64735,"It looks amazing, well done!"
64736,Presents don't have to be expensive or even store-bought.
64737,People also love things that are made with care and love.
64738,You did good!
64739,Yall took me by surprise..
64740,I appreciate it so much.
64741,I can’t wait for tomorrow!
64742,Wishing all a lovely holiday x
64743,Those are beautiful and will be highly welcomed.
64744,You could have sold them!
64745,This is incredible!
64746,If I were getting this instead of gifts I would be so thankful that you put so much time into making these.
64747,"One year money was super tight for my big sister and she made us biscuits, liqueurs, little handmade chocolates etc and it was probably the best gift I ever got from her."
64748,I absolutely loved it.
64749,I'm sure they'll love it too
64750,I would be pumped to get these!
64751,I don’t want more random junk anyway!
64752,You put in a lot of effort and that’s so sweet as well.
64753,These are beautiful!
64754,They look delicious and nothing is better than something homemade for the Holidays!❤️🎄
64755,10/10 would prefer a gift like this over a gift card or mug or whatever.
64756,Cooking is love so I am all about this.
64757,Plus those cheese straw things look tasty af.
64758,"I think I would cry (of happiness, of course) if I got those snacks from someone I love!"
64759,They look delicious and made with a lot of love!
64760,You did a great job!
64761,These are amazing!!!!
64762,"The time, effort, love and thought put into these make them the most valuable of all!!!"
64763,I would prefer this over store bought anyday!!!
64764,!
64765,This is a brilliant idea!
64766,An assortment of snackies to munch watching a movie!
64767,All sorts of clever variations you could do!
64768,!
64769,These look great and such a thoughtful gift!
64770,These look absolutely wonderful!
64771,May I ask where you got those nice little boxes?
64772,I spent about $30 on Christmas this year.
64773,Everything came from what I had in my pantry.
64774,Sometimes it’s the thought that counts and those boxes look gorgeous!
64775,I'm no softie but if someone gave me a present made with that much dedication I'd have to fight back tears.
64776,"I love it, it's so Christmassy!"
64777,Love the treasure planet!
64778,These are beautiful and super thoughtful!!!
64779,"Personally I think receiving something handmade and full of love, no matter how big or small, is so heartwarming and shows a person how much you care about them."
64780,Happy holidays 🖤
64781,Man I wish people would do this instead of spending a lot of money.
64782,It would warm my heart to get something like this
64783,You are so kind and hard working.
64784,I’m proud of you for spending time on these delicious snack boxes.
64785,"To be honest, I would rather have these than any gift."
64786,"Edit to say, merry Christmas my loved one."
64787,"Hey sis,

I just wanted to let you know I would be absolutely THRILLED to receive this from you!"
64788,"It all looks so yummy, and I might just have to get your recipes!"
64789,"I know these couple of years have been rough, I've been feeling it too."
64790,"You're not alone, and next year can be better!"
64791,Sending my love!
64792,This is a gift from the heart.
64793,The best kind.
64794,This is the sweetest thing ever!
64795,That looks amazing

64802,I might steal this one for next year--oh who am I fooling?
64803,Totally stealing sweetheart!
64804,Very clever ❤
64805,Those snack boxes look amazing!
64806,I would be thrilled to get one.
64807,Well Done.
64808,I'm proud of you.
64809,Presents do not need to be expensive.
64810,In fact I personally feel guilty receiving expensive presents because I don't like very many things.
64811,"But I love food, especially homemade food."
64812,I am never disappointed to receive pretty homemade treats!
64813,They look delicious!
64814,That's a thoughtful gift I'd love to receive.
64815,That looks delicious!
64816,I would honestly prefer this type of gift over a material item.
64817,Hope you have a joyous holiday :)
64818,I dunno what you’re worried about.
64819,I would love and cherish that over some store bought gift any day!
64820,"Lovely, simply lovely."
64821,"I'd prefer one of those boxes any day to more ""stuff""!"
64822,"OMG these look amazing, babygirl!"
64823,I would be honoured to receive one of these gift boxes!
64824,"I love this idea, Dear One!"
64825,Very clever and thoughtful.
64826,I would be happy to receive this gift.
64827,I would absolutely love this as a gift!
64828,Good job!
64829,"my goodness, that looks amazing!"
64830,The thought and time that went into that would make it one of the best gifts I could get.

64836,I’m so proud!
64837,I would be delighted to receive this as a gift!
64838,this is so incredibly kind and lovely 🥺
64839,Hi sib!
64840,This looks incredible; I would be a very happy friend if I got something that looked half as good!
64841,I would be 1000% delighted to receive one of these.
64842,Looks so beautiful and delicious.
64843,You should be proud of them!
64844,You guys are awesome!
64845,I would eat the hell out of that snack box!
64846,I love thoughtful gifts and these are super thoughtful!
64847,I tend to make things as gifts instead of buying.
64848,My family and friends know that I can't spend money so I spend time instead.
64849,"These all look delicious, and I'd be thrilled to receive a box of these at Christmas."
64850,I'd be super happy with that!
64851,Looks amazing!💚
64852,I’d love to get this as a gift!
64853,And did the same many years back when money was tight.
64854,It’s completely acceptable and a thoughtful gift!
64855,"That you took the time, and thought of them, and made them these delicious (and honestly adorable) goodies is so amazing and awesome."
64856,You did such a good job!
64857,!
64858,"As someone that doesn’t need any more shit, I would absolutely love this!"
64859,"I also just enjoy hand made gifts best anyway, though."
64860,This is an amazing present.
64861,I would prefer this over crap I  don't need!
64862,My favorite Christmas present is homemade baked goods!
64863,"These look delicious, you did well!"
64864,"A labor of love, best gift ive seen!!"
64865,Id be delighted to recieve such a thoughtful gift.
64866,"Hey honey, I want to make sure you have my current address so you can be SURE and drop off my goody box!"
64867,All the best gifts come from the heart and end up in the stomach.
64868,These are amazing and frankly the best kind of gift to get.
64869,"Your time, effort, and love are priceless."
64870,Those are some very lucky family and friends!
64871,"Ok, first of all, recipe or name of number 6!"
64872,Looks delicious!
64873,"As a mum myself, I LOVE little snacky snack boxes as gifts!"
64874,"As hectic as the holidays are, these are truly awesome and thoughtful."
64875,Preparing and cooking is more thoughtful than buying and wrapping.
64876,You rock!
64877,"""Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!"
64878,"What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store."
64879,"What if Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more!"""
64880,"These look incredible, great job."
64881,Any good friend would be ecstatic to receive one.
64882,"As someone who has done this and had this done for me, I can tell you they will love it!"
64883,The thought and effort will be loved by all!
64884,!
64885,I think it is a particularly lovely idea.
64886,"When I was first married, we didn't have two pennies to rub together."
64887,We gave homemade gifts that everyone said they really liked.

65254,"If you sold these beautiful snack arrangements through pre-orders, many people would pay good money to gift them to others (I can't think of anyone I know who wouldn't love these as a present!"

For me, I use the strongest mature cheddar I can find for cheap lol, and for seasoning I use salt and mixed crushed pepper and thyme."

65277,little labels.
65278,Almost zero cost (I did use thread to sew the bags).
65279,"They were meant as kind of drawer fresheners/ just a nice smelling bag 🤷🏻‍♀️

The labels said something like: handpicked organic lavender."

65287,"Thank you, we met through friends who suggested we’d make a good pair."
65288,They were right 🥰
65289,"I will make you a cake, friend."
65290,It may not be pretty but it will taste good.
65291,Having woken up to such an amazing response..
65292,I am actually considering it.
65293,"I thought they might look too homemade for that kind of thing but it seems like people love that..

My family know I am food safety and hygiene level 2 certified after running a restaurant with 5/5 hygiene for 3 years now."
65294,Soon as my coffee hits and my emotions settle from reading all these comments I will take fancy pics of everything - thank you so much and take care x

65321,"My 2nd D&C, and had a MMC."

65343,Mine are 10 years apart and it’s crazy how much more present I was with the second child.
65344,It’s okay to take a few extra minutes to enjoy where you are and what you’re doing.
65345,My second bit of advice it don’t let the kids come to bed with you at night!
65346,You should keep your bedroom your grown-up sanctuary where you can escape if needed; if you do this it will become the only place in the house you can do so.
65347,😅

65364,"The age gap was due to several miscarriages, including two that landed me in the hospital."
65365,My younger one had a twin that didn't make it.
65366,"All this is to say, you honor your lost babies by enjoying every moment with the babies you can hug."
65367,"Watching my ""rainbow baby"" grow into his adulthood, find a purpose, find a life partner fills my heart with joy."

65646,Happy birthday!
65647,!
65648,First: happy birthday!
65649,Second: I am a mom who is trash at dates.
65650,I gave my kid’s DOB at the pharmacy so haltingly they asked if it was for a pet.
65651,I remembered his birthday wrong for the better part of a year and only remembered when my friend (who gave birth exactly nine months after I did) posted her kid’s birthday and I had a synapse misfire.
65652,I’d take a bullet for that kid.
65653,I love him more than breathing.
65654,Some people are wired wrong for dates.
65655,My best friends have been my best friends since we were 14 and I still only remember one’s birthday because it’s on a holiday.
65656,"I’m not making excuses for your folks, I just want you to know forgetting the date doesn’t necessarily mean forgetting how important and wonderful you are."
65657,I hope they’re sufficiently repentant tomorrow but paint the town red tonight.
65658,"Happy birthday to you, wonderful!"
65659,"For what it's worth, I am POSITIVE that in the future you will have amazing birthdays spent with people you love, who love and appreciate you."
65660,"I can't tell you when, but I just know it's going to happen."
65661,"Maybe when it does, come back here and tell us about it?"
65662,"Either way, until then, we are all here to wish you a happy happy birthday!"
65663,"Here are some flowers, because everyone deserves something lovely to look at on their birthday  🌹🌷🌺🪷🌺🌷🌹"
65664,Sweetheart - Happy 18th birthday!
65665,"As I once read on Reddit, you already survived all these years and days successfully!"
65666,I hope you celebrate this milestone with a treat for yourself.
65667,I love buying myself something for my birthday because I know it will be something I really want.
65668,Always treat yourself right.
65669,Happy birthday sibling :D
65670,"Happy birthday,  baby cakes!!!!"
65671,"Right now, plan a date for yourself!"
65672,"Go to an art museum, try a new resteraunt,  go on a hike."
65673,Do something you haven't done.
65674,"The next post you do, I want to hear what you chose and what a great time you had."
65675,Lots of love from your Minnesota Momma!
65676,"Happy birthday, sweetie!"
65677,Sending hugs and kisses 😘
65678,Happy birthday!!

65683,"Sometimes that is the best gift, time for yourself from yourself."
65684,Happy birthday !
65685,"Happy birthday, lovely!!"
65686,Today is my birthday too!
65687,I'm so glad to share a birthday with someone as grand as you.
65688,I'm sorry that it hasn't been especially great so far.
65689,I've had some crummy birthdays myself.
65690,"In fact, my own mother only posted on my Facebook (no personal text or call) and I haven't even heard from my dad at all."
65691,Not even on Facebook!

66236,I am so sorry but sometimes life blends and we know important dates are coming but we forget.

66252,The world is so lucky you are in it.
66253,"I am sorry your birthday had to start like that, but also very proud that you took steps yourself to make sure it will be an overall good day ☺️

And as many have said, remember it is perfectly fine to treat yourself the way that helps you most."
66254,"In many situations, such as when you are proud of your progress, or how well you handled a situation, and most certainly in more somber situations like this!"
66255,"Whether it is some nice food, a hobby thing you had been holding out on getting, spending time with your favorite music/tv show, you deserve to treat yourself ❤️"
66256,Congratulations on leveling up another level!!!
66257,I'm sorry no one in your life remembered this day.
66258,"It sucks I know, as we are conditioned to celebrate this day and make a big deal out of it."
66259,"But honestly, it doesn't have to be if you don't want it to be."
66260,I hope you had a wonderfully marvelous day nonetheless.
66261,Well Happy Birthday to you!
66262,"<3

I hope you have a good day."
66263,Go out a get yourself a little something that you’ve wanted for awhile.

66271,Glad you got yourself a treat and had a good time doing it!
66272,"As you get older, folks will forget your birthday from time to time, or simply not do much to celebrate it, so don’t put much in the way of expectations on that."
66273,It’s one of the harder things about growing up  - others treat us more as adults when sometimes we only want to be hugged or feted or patted on the back.
66274,"Take it as a sign that others now see you as more mature, and don’t think you need these things."
66275,Don’t interpret it as “no one cares” - that’s not the right frame.
66276,"If the party itself is important to you, then organize one yourself so it happens."
66277,"If you just want to celebrate more low-key next year, invite your favourite person (or a random stranger) out for a meal, and make your own celebration."
66278,Buy someone else a treat in honour of another year around the sun!
66279,"You have a whole year to answer the question “now that I’m an adult, how do I want to celebrate what I’ve accomplished over this past year?”  That’s what a grown-up birthday is all about!"
66280,"Happy birthday id give you a physical  gift if i coukd but alls i can offer is internet hugs from another duckling  just remebr just cause the gocerment says your an ""adult"" doesnt mean yoy dont have alot of growing to do still ❤️"
66281,Fuck everyone else!!

66293,Focus on YOU today!
66294,Know that you mean something to someone and you don’t even know it.
66295,Your smile brightens up someone’s day and they have never told you.
66296,Someone loves you and never communicated it bc they think you should already know.
66297,💜
66298,"happy birthday ...hope you turned it into a celebration of self ...not to be a self involved freak but just for some relativity ...i have not had a birthday celebration with anyone else for the last 39 years and cannot envisage that ever changing which is just pathetic proof there is always someone worse off ...which is not to boo hoo for me or to negate your reaction to being forgotten , its just the only thought that will drag me from a whirlpool of negativity sometimes ...also if your friends forgot , find better friends and dont be worried about telling your family they suck for forgetting ...if there is love their they will feel bad and then make you feel better (or so TV has led me to believe) or they will reveal they are humans you should distance yourself from :) ...you can choose your friends but not your family ..although you can choose to have nothing to do with your family if the situation warrants it ..not nice but sometimes has to be done for sanity :) take care and wish you much life love and laughter for all your days :)"
66299,Happy Birthday!
66300,!

66309,The top post says you should do something special for yourself!
66310,Yes you should!
66311,You should also make a pledge to do something special for yourself once a week.
66312,"Doesn't have to cost money, doesn't have to take up a lot of time."
66313,But make sure you put yourself first consistently.

66315,Frosty hugs from Norway -

66346,Mine has been ignored by a parent many times.
66347,Watching same parent “forget” my daughter’s birthday was the most heartbreaking thing I saw.
66348,"She was born on St Patrick’s Day, he was in the room when she was born, she was his first grandchild, and I called and texted him many times that day."
66349,Sometimes family is just shit.
66350,I’m incredibly sorry you got the short end of the stick on that.
66351,I would love to make you a cake.
66352,You deserve to have such a big day celebrated.
66353,Much love to you.

66364,As others have suggested do something for yourself that makes you happy.
66365,I am no contact with my family now and I’ve had a lot of birthdays forgotten and know how much it hurts.
66366,The good part is you are 18 and starting your future.
66367,It takes time but you can start to build new friendships and find the people who will want to celebrate future birthdays with you.
66368,"Happy birthday, friend!"
66369,"Cuddle with a plushie if you'd like, that always makes me feel better :D"

66393,I'm glad you're here ☺️.
66394,I saw you treated yourself to coffee and I'm glad.
66395,Happy birthday hon 🎂🎁🎉🎊
66396,I send my sympathies.
66397,It's so hard being forgotten.
66398,As a mom I learned I *had* to advocate for myself and let other people know when I was feeling unappreciated.
66399,You will learn how too!
66400,Definitely do something nice for yourself today.
66401,Then ask the parents for whatever kind of celebration meal you'd like this weekend.
66402,Be specific.
66403,Call restaurants before the convo to ensure a reservation is available.
66404,Specify that you'd like them to pay.
66405,Don't get all mopey because it is possible there's a surprise birthday party in there works for you... and it would suck if that's what's happening.
66406,And then grab their phones and add in your birthday to their calendars so they can't claim to forget again.
66407,Happy birthday duckie!
66408,"You’re an amazing, awesome human and I hope you have a wonderful birthday!"

66541,I've got my loving husband now who has said happy birthday to me today  now more times than I count.
66542,"I've got a yummy crab dinner waiting for me as well as a birthday pumpkin pie, and even some presents to unwrap when my husband gets home from work."
66543,But I do love sharing my birthday and celebrating the day with my birthday twins.
66544,Yay us!
66545,We're awesome!
66546,!
66547,Of course you are amazing and love you ❤❤

66550,I bet your cookies were great!
66551,(I also love cookies haha!)
66552,And you made a nice healthy meal.
66553,Good for you!
66554,"Cooking can be hard and sometime depressing when it doesn't live up for your expectations, your dish looks really good but don't be afraid to cook even basic ""unhealthy"" food like mac'n cheese

The first step and the most important is that you like what you've done"
66555,Well done!
66556,That looks really tasty!
66557,Is that.. is that salmon?
66558,What time shall you expect me for dinner?
66559,You should cook more often!
66560,Lovely presentation.
66561,Well done.
66562,Looks very good!
66563,May you keep up the cooking 🍳
66564,"I cook meals for five people probably 6 out of 7 days per week (I love cooking), but you’ve managed to make something I haven’t in a long time: salmon."
66565,Everyone in my house but me hates salmon; I love it.
66566,"And now thanks to you, they’ll be eating it anyway tomorrow lol."
66567,Lovely job.
66568,Keep taking care of yourself.
66569,❤️
66570,That's looks awesome.
66571,I honestly thought you had two huge rounded pieces of provolone and not a potato for a second
66572,I live in the PNW so salmon is a staple in my diet… I eat it a lot.
66573,"So, I’m super impressed that you got your buzz on — to cook this meal in particular."
66574,You touched my heart.
66575,What is your next desired meal?
66576,"Like, a thick steak, cooked on a bbq or Oven cooked."
66577,"Overall, good on you!"

66651,(:
66652,I've had a hard time *actually* cooking for quite a while now.
66653,I've found that a grill is my new best friend.
66654,I can make just about anything on it and also without worrying about cleaning various amounts of dishes everyday.
66655,Lots of vegetables and some meat.
66656,All mostly finger food.
66657,It has helped me get back in to cooking while leaving me mostly stress free of the ensuing chores.
66658,Is that salmon?
66659,"One of my favorite meals, and the salmon looks perfectly done!"
66660,Great work!

66668,And just to let you know you’re not alone.
66669,And this post made me feel not alone.
66670,Whatever obstacles you’ve been dealing with in your life won’t always be there and it shows that you have the strength to overcome it all.
66671,This may seem like a simple step but I know it’s a big one.
66672,It’s good to get the reassurance that I’m not alone out there to where doing simple tasks seem like so much work.
66673,"Good job, looks yummy."
66674,Looooks amazing!
66675,"Chef mom here, darling- the sear on that salmon is top notch!"
66676,Excellent job.
66677,Bon appetit.
66678,This looks so delicious and beautiful!
66679,You did a good job on it all and i hope you enjoyed every bit of it!
66680,"Cooking is hard, my partner and I are trying to get back into the swing of cooking ourselves."
66681,We're both suffering from depression and are both just fighting the urge to pick something up.
66682,But the feeling we get when we see our plates and the leftovers in our kitchen - it helps us a little.
66683,"You're doing good, love."
66684,You've made a good decision and your decision will thank you
66685,That looks delicious!
66686,Well done!
66687,Looks fantastic.
66688,I would love a piece.
66689,Good job!🥰
66690,So proud of you.
66691,Seems like you haven't lost your touch if you haven't cooked in a year.
66692,"The meat looks perfect, the veggies look delicious."
66693,Remember always add less salt than you need.
66694,You can always add more but never remove it
66695,... well now I'm hungry...
66696,And you went for the healthy food too!
66697,Awesome
66698,This looks great !
66699,Real plates too .
66700,Perfection .
66701,It looks very good!
66702,Great job!
66703,:)
66704,This looks wonderful!
66705,I’m proud of you (and save me a plate!)
66706,"It's taken me ten years to get mac'n'cheese right, it's nothing to scoff at 😩"
66707,"I cook myself the most basic of foods, usually meat and veg, but the satisfaction of cooking my own meal makes it taste so much better than buying meals"
66708,Everyone in my house hated salmon until i cooked it properly for them and advised them they did not have to eat the skin.
66709,Thank you.
66710,"♥️
Had to google what provolone is."
66711,Is it good?
66712,Next I’m thinking about Chili con Carne.
66713,Not sure when I can do it.
66714,Yes it is
66715,add brie and it feels gourmet as hell 👌
66716,I even take the skin off for these people lol.
66717,"I have stuffed it, I have baked it, I have grilled it, I have poached it, I have broiled it…and so on."
66718,They are categorically again any fish that is pink and not fried.
66719,It's good melted generously on a sandwich.
66720,"No, no it's not

Edit: provolone fucking sucks."
66721,Excellent choice.
66722,"And the awesome thing about chili is that you can cook 10+ serves as easily as you can cook 2, so if make it in bulk and freeze the extra portions individually, you can just grab it and reheat whenever you're feeling like something home cooked but just don't have the ability to actually cook."
66723,"Plus you can have lots of different meals from the same thing - taco's, chili, loaded fries, etc :-)"
66724,❤️
66725,I live salmon
66726,Lemme just write that down 🤔
66727,It’s good melted on just about everything.🙂
66728,The pro-provolone set has spoken.😐
66729,"Check out the difference between soft bread crumbs, normal bread crumbs, and panko bread crumbs."
66730,"Pick your choice, a little bit of grated parmesan on top..."
66731,You can keep your trash cheese.
66732,Its worse than Swiss
66733,Bread crumbs on mac'n'cheese?
66734,Who knew!
66735,"I like smoked Gouda the best, but nothing…NOTHING is more disgusting than that bitter piece of plastic they call Swiss cheese!!"
66736,!
66737,Oh it's the best!
66738,!
66739,"See, that's how I feel about provolone."
66740,Blech.
66741,We can just agree to disagree on provolone but agree on the Swiss abomination.
66742,"Nope, now you have to like Swiss or face the wrath of the majority!"
66743,I will die first!!
66744,!
66745,"Swiss is awful, Gouda sucks."
66746,Gouda is manna from heaven and…well yeah Swiss is crap.
