10,shxdas,eona62,Just received my positive pcr test... I could need a mom right now. My real mom doesn't bother but every thing is so Strenuous. I just took a shower and needed a 30 min nap afterwards....,280
11,shxdas,SionnachLiath,"You shaped her but she shaped you too. During pregnancy, foetal cells cross the placenta and become part of the mother's body. Then they stay there - in any tissue you want to name. You carry her with you always (not just in your heart). And if you give yourself a hug, you're hugging her too. So I hope you treat yourself well, you'll be treating little pieces of her well too. 

I unexpectedly lost my mum a few years ago - we just passed the five year anniversary last weekend. These big milestones can be hard, can't they? Are you doing anything to mark your daughters birthday? She was so like you, beautiful smiles on both in the picture.",56

I ended up back in her life because myself and my boyfriend needed a place to stay. I tried to be kind to her and shove down the trauma I had from her abuse, but she ended up cheating on my stepdad, the only parent who ever cared about me. We are both hurt and heart broken, and she’s off doing Xanax with someone ten years older than I. I feel so upset that I ever let her back into my life, only for her to ruin a part of it again. I wish I could’ve had a mom to just talk with and rant about life, instead of someone who hurt me like this. I’m only 19, and yet I’ve been more responsible than her for over 5 years, moved out since I was 17. I’m just tired. I wish I had someone to bake cookies with and get nails done. Not this.",10

I had a stupid violent outburst last night for the first time in almost 6 months. Thankfully, it was just me and the dog home so my boyfriend didn’t have to witness it. I punched the wall a bunch of times and my hand is already starting to bruise.

I cannot even comprehend losing a child. I have two and feel blessed every day to wake up and know they are awake or will awaken as well.
  
I don't take this for granted, because I know there are others who had the same but lost it somewhere.
  
When I pray, I always ask God why this sort of pain exists in the world. Is it the price we pay for being human ? Or are we missing a big piece of some puzzle that dictates the human condition ? I have not yet received an answer, but I will continue to ask.
  
I'm still hugging you.

Hey mom. Life has been getting a bit hectic lately. I find myself wondering if my job is going to last much longer. It seems that when I'm the only assistant in the office, I get all the work (as I should, I'm the only one there), but when I'm not the only assistant, I get none of the work. I ask if there is anything I could be doing, or if anyone needs help, but I'm told no. 

As it is a temporary assignment with a temp agency, should I stick it out till the end of my contract,  or should I call it quits and move on to another assignment? I'm so confused. I really like this job, but I find myself bored a lot and even though I try to look busy and often take typing tests,  or aimlessly click around when somknw walks by, it's proving to be a struggle because everyone would rather go to someone else than me. 

The cherry on top of it all is if I do leave this temp job, I don't know if I'll be able to collect on unemployment insurance while I wait to be selected for a new one. And I know if it happens that I decide to move on, Travis (boyfriend) will then be alone in paying bills, and he's already stressing out because of finances as it is. With me having no job, I think it might just break him, and I'm scared. 

I don't know what to do mom. I'm feeling stuck. I don't like having a job where I don't feel my skills are properly utilized, and where i feel as though Im being passed over, because im a temp employee, but i love what i do, when im actually doing it, and i knpw that keeping the job, as long as the contract is active, will help eliviate the financial burden that Travis is feeling. He's the bread winner of us two, and i just feel so terrible that hes been supporting me and our kid for years, while i struggle to find a permanent job and bounce from one temporary position to another, hoping that on of the company's will like me enough to keep me. 😔",3

The last few years, I tried to do so much work on my mental health (I still blame myself for not doing enough) and I made a lot of progress, but I'm in a crossroads now. I was denied entry from the country I was living in and I'm trying to get back, but I'm not sure if my future is there anymore. I'm not sure if my future is with my boyfriend, who loves me but is older and also mentally ill.

I'm not sure if I should move back to my home country, or find somewhere new. Study or keep working with what I'm doing. I feel like I can't survive being alive and I have too many ""needs"" and I'm so lazy (like ordering food instead of cooking) and I can just barely keep it all together but balls keep falling down.

And you're so kind to want to share this light and warmth with others.


Sometimes I wish I had a mom that cared about me more than they care about themselves being right, or first. 
My mother won't message me for long periods of time as a passive aggressive way to show me she doesn't care and I need to be the first to message always. 

Also my eldest sibling manipulates her to feel badly towards me, because we are estranged. 

Basically, I wish I had a healthy relationship with my mom and she was someone I could turn to for comfort and support when I need it. 

She even made me feel shitty about my getting married to a wonderful person, saying that I think I am better than her and the family because I married well.",2

I try not to think about what happened or why he did what he did too much, but I'm terrified ill hear the cops knocking on my door telling me that someone else I love was found deceased. 

It's a terrible terrible thing to lose someone too soon. I too call my mom mother when I'm mad and call her mom most of the time. She's my best friend in the entire world and I can't imagine losing her.

I lost my momma when I was 16, and will be turning 24 here in a few short weeks. I was born in the early morning the day after Valentine’s Day and my mom spent most of the 14th in the hospital that year, so She always called me her “Valentine’s Day baby” For the rest of her life she tried her very hardest to celebrate me every moment she could, but especially on Valentine’s Day. It was our special day. I miss her every second. Oh, how badly I want to look her in the eyes and say “Mom, look at me now!! See how much I’ve grown!”",2

I think that's one of the things I miss the most from before covid. I'm sorry that you had a rough day today. You've always told me to let myself feel sad, but when it's ready to pass, let it pass. I hope her memory will continue to bless us all as we continue, even without her. 

She was beautiful, by the way.

I've changed a bit since we last got to talk, new career path, bodies getting a bit worse and I fell in love with someone I can't pursue again, it's a struggle not being able to talk to you when I want. 

I know I haven't always been the easiest child to talk to but we had our own ways of showing our love and respect for eachother. 

I know your life was full of loss and trials, how did you find yourself moving on from the situations you couldn't control? How did you become a pillar of maturity while still learning to be an adult yourself?

I'm 32 now, your youngest is halfway ready to have her first, life is moving fast. How can I live up to the expectations you had? I know I can do it but I don't know what a mother's true expectations for their child is anymore.

I have been trying really hard to be strong and to take care of myself. You raised me to be a strong and intelligent woman. But it's been so hard, and I just wish you could be here. I missed when I was so sick and you offered to come visit me just to give me a hug and make me my favorite food. I remember when I would cry to you because I would be so stressed in school, and you would remind me just how proud you were of me. I am struggling to keep afloat. I try not to skip meals, and I am still practicing my Korean just for you. I wish you could've made me food and eat our favorite cake on my 21st birthday. I wish that you could've be there for me next year when I graduate. I even wish you could call me and nag me to eat more vegetables because my forehead is breaking out.
I keep experiencing more of life, but I wish I could share those moments with you. I keep having dreams like you never died and that we are still together and living life as if it were normal. Unfortunately, it's hard when I wake up, and I realize that it isn't the case. Everything reminds me of you, and I still talk about you as if you never passed in the first place. 엄마 너무 보고싶어. 엄마 너무 사랑해.

I know that I'm not your daughter, and I know that you're not my mom. But as someone who turned 21 just over 3 months ago, I want to just say that I love you so much, Mom. I miss you so much, and I want you to know that I am staying strong for you. I have so many people who are with me, who love and care for me. I am really in a new stage of life, but I am growing so much and thriving because of how well you have taken care of me. Of course it's not easy without you, but I want to remind you of the amazing things you have done and what an amazing and strong person you continue to be.

But 15 is the year I realized that I'm a trans guy, and the year my relationship with my mother changed forever, 11 years ago now. If I may, I'd like to give to you some of the love that I've been holding on to and wishing I could give to a mom:

.

Hi, mom! I know I haven't reached out in a few weeks, but you know how I am. The world turns fast and I get caught up in it. 

I just wanted to say that I love you. I'm really grateful that you're my mom, and I count myself lucky for the time we've had. It wasn't perfect—neither of us are perfect people—but you've done a really great job. You always believed me when I was figuring myself out, and accepted me without question.

That love and trust is the main reason why I'm so confident today. That's why I feel the freedom to try anything in front of me. You believe in my ability to fly, but I know if I end up falling you'll be right there by my side when I hit the ground, offering me a hand up and a hug. Even if you didn't approve, even if we fought, you never talked down to me. You've always been safe.

As hard as you tried to be there for me, I had to do my own thing for a bit. Those were some hard years, and lonely ones, and I know you were hurting for me that whole time. I'm sorry you had to worry. The day I realized I could call you, cry, and come home? That was the first good day I'd had in a long time.

I wouldn't ask for any other mom. I know you overcame a lot to be the best mom you could be, and I'm so proud to be your kid. When I'm a parent, I hope I can live up to your example.

Thanks for being the greatest. As always, I love you! Here's a hug across the internet.

Love,
Always Your Kid",2

367,shxdas,garbagecompressor,"I lost my mom, so I sort of imagine we're somehow in different worlds.

Mama. Thank you for taking care of me as much as you could whenever I was sick. Whenever I get sick now, I try to get myself jell-o since you can't make it for me anymore. Thank you for everything. I know you were so worried about me, and I miss you so much. Thank you for being nice, when being my mom was so frustrating because you worried so much and wanted me to be okay. Even though you can't see me, I'm doing my best. I love you SO much.",2

401,shxdas,Agent_of_Jotunheim53,I’m sorry about your daughter 🥺. I’m waiting on results from a pet scan to ensure the cancer I’ve had to beat twice is gone. I’m terrified it might be back even though I have no lumps or symptoms but if it’s clear I’ll have been cancer free for a whole year,1

403,shxdas,Amazona86,I do.,1
404,shxdas,baileygraceinspace,"My sister passed away at 29. I can understand sibling loss, but my heart hurts for my loving mother who lost her firstborn daughter. My big sister would be 31 this year. My heart goes out to you. 

Does talking about her help? I always wonder if talking about my sister helps or hurts my mom. She’s a quiet person so as an extroverted autistic it can be sometimes hard to understand quiet people.


I hope you are doing okay. You seem like a kind person.",1
405,shxdas,moongate12,I'm crying reading the messages. I love you mom.,1
406,shxdas,StMongo,"I could use a mom.  I’m in university now, but when I was 15, school guidance counsellors told me I was too stupid for uni, and my mother never stood up for me.  What sucks is she tells me she’s proud of me now and insists that I was the one who didn’t want to go to school.  I could use some genuine, clear headed pride in what I’ve done for myself so far.  Thanks!",1
407,shxdas,Rebeckajamie,I love you mom!!!! You were and are all a daughter could ever ask.,1
408,shxdas,The_Woman_S,"Hi mom, my mum is on the other side of the world and I really miss her. I just miss hugs. School is going okay I guess. I just kind of feel lost and not sure I can do this. I just keep hearing in my head that there is a 50% pass rate for this degree and I don’t know if I can do it. I’m way to stubborn to quit but I keep expecting them to kick me out any day now because they figure out I’m not the right person for this project. My friend C, back home in CA, lost her mum this past weekend and her dad isn’t doing well since it happened. Ended up in the hospital and now they are saying he has lost the “will to thrive” or something like that. I don’t know how to help her or be there for her from so far away. I just wish I could fly there to hug her and cook her a proper meal and make her sit down for longer than 10 minutes and just eat. 

I’m stressed and so anxious about school I think it’s giving me acid reflux. Scared of running out of my stash of Tums… I ran out of melatonin today and learned that I have to get a prescription for it here, which is weirdly complicated. I would have packed more of it last time I visited if I had known that! 

It’s nice seeing all of the virtual hugs and advice. You are an amazing mom for all of us and I hope you know that you are very loved.",1

412,shxdas,Jess1620,I miss you too mom. Coming from a girl who had to take a break from my mom. No need to go further into the sub since this is about a good mom missing her beautiful girl. I miss you too. Hugs,1
413,shxdas,acthcoffee,"My mother has helped me out a lot today. She's been understanding, caring, and so helpful but I've had such a difficult time today. Just getting out of bed was ridiculously hard. The only thing that finally got me out of bed was that I knew I would get to see my girlfriend today. I got up and I did everything I needed to. When she was available she canceled on me and it just broke my heart that she didn't even want to talk on the phone. Maybe that's my fault for relying on her like that but I just couldn't stop crying. I was so angry at myself I put a dent in my driver seat's door. My mother noticed when I came back inside and stopped everything to help me. Gave me solutions and tasks to distract me. It really helped but I'm back in my hole now....
I don't know.... Maybe I just needed to get that off my chest. Either way your daughter is beautiful and I'm sure you would be just as loving. I'm sorry...",1

I haven’t properly talked to my mum since November 2020, her last message after that, was night before my birthday almost a year ago, it was a selfish message. I struggled for a while, but it gets easier. You think about them less and worry about what would happen if you saw them again less frequently. She wasn’t a good parent but it takes time to mourn that loss of not having what you wanted and deserved. It’s ok for it to hurt no matter how much you don’t want it to, until now you probably held out hope, and that hope is gone. If you ever need someone that might understand, I’m here. Hugs x",2

It took me awhile but I was able to find my fellow weirdos and we had a grand time together. You got this, it may take a bit but be patient and you'll find your path.",3

699,shxdas,memesupreme83,"Hi mom, I just wanted to let you know I talked to my bio mom about it... She didn't freak out. She almost sounded like she was happy for me. Maybe my relationship can be repaired with her someday.

ETA: I saw your daughter died of an overdose, and Im so sorry. My brother died of an overdose too. I hope one day you can heal. And don't listen to the cruel people, there are some that don't know that addiction happens to anyone, and anyone can get taken with an overdose. My mother never fully recovered from it, I don't think. 

One piece of advice for you, If you have other children, make sure they're not living in your daughter's shadow or legacy. That was really hard for my siblings and I.",2

704,shxdas,borderline_cat,"It felt like my boyfriend was being dismissive towards me. He works 10+ hr days and I’m staying home atm. I look forward to him coming home so we can hang out and unwind together. 

He went to spend time with a friend after work, which he did tell me about before he got home. He said “a few hours”. He came back in two hours later and said he wasn’t staying but would be home “soon”. Essentially, I kept getting “soon” but his tone wasn’t dismissive. 

I’d say around 8:30 is when my brain just wasn’t okay with it anymore. I was getting really mad about constantly being told “soon” but “soon” was almost all night. I have loads of trauma and something my parents would always do is say “soon” in reference to any and everything I asked and were extremely dismissive. I’m thinking that his response of “soon” triggered those thoughts. 

It feels so dumb to type out. I’m almost 23 but still feel like such a child. I am in therapy though. I’ve been in therapy since I was 11 and have only recently got out of survival mode enough to try and heal.",3

I can’t say I completely understand how hard it is but I had to say goodbye to a old classmate last year and that was already painful enough. take care of yourself mum and take peace in the memories.

767,shxdas,wwitchiepoo,"She was born April of 1991. She died January of 93. It’s ok.  And I wouldn’t be offended if you corrected me, because for nearly all of these years I have tried my hardest not to do the math. I suck at math, so it is something I avoid like the plague. When it comes to her, I celebrated her birthday for years because I felt I was betraying her if I didn’t. But I’m the one who has to live on, and it was hurting me. So I stopped. She didn’t die naturally, the circumstance are horrific, so I wanted to blot it out. I had PTSD for 26 years before I finally found some peace with EMDR therapy. I highly recommend it. 

But I only know how old she’d be now because my daughter (who is disabled) has a nurse who is the same age and she’s been with us for years. But I appreciate your comments. I know they were not meant to be anything but kind. 

I thank you all for making today so much better. OP, biggest hugs from me for helping ME out today, when you needed it just as badly. That was super kind and selfless of you to share the hugs and the love and share of yourself. You’re a fantastic mom.",2

Know that there is someone in your life that cares and wants to help. Now that you’ve said it out loud, the hard part of accepting the issue is done. We spend a lot of time as Mums being strong and protecting the people we care about from emotional harm…. Sometimes by not mentioning our own concerns. But you’ve done that now. You said it out loud! Worry isn’t going away until you take action to do what you can to improve the situation. Move onto solutions and look for the opportunity to be vulnerable and ask for the help that is waiting in the wings. Helping someone we care about through a rocky patch can be a gift to ourselves just as much as it is to the recipient. We all want to feel needed and valued….. especially us Moms. It’s our oxygen! Give someone who needs that feeling the opportunity to help you so you can pay it forward when your feet are on more solid financial ground. 

I hope your current situation gets better.",5

851,tl4uwe,IcyDay5,"Hey sis! Beautiful dress, I love the colour and the detailing, and it looks amazing on you!


Can we talk about your boyfriend for a minute? Saying he hates the dress is such a strong reaction. Does he express negative judgements about you often? Does he try to tell you how to dress? I dont want to jump to conclusions but I want to make sure you're ok",360

857,tl4uwe,spandexcatsuit,"This dress fits you well, it flatters you, and it’s 100% appropriate for prom. It’s too bad he doesn’t love it, but that’s seriously not your concern. **We don’t dress for men’s approval, we dress for ourselves.**

I’m concerned about this boyfriend and the way he handled this. It’s really important that you date people who show they care about your comfort and well being. If you had a date pick out a dress you didn’t care for, how would you behave? Because I really doubt you’d be insensitive about something this special that they were naturally excited about. 

He should have kept it to himself if he wouldn’t have chosen the same dress. And he should have reassured you that you look *beautiful* no matter what you wear. Sounds like he didn’t think of that.

Notice how he talks to you. Notice how it feels. Then consider how you’d show love and respect for someone if you were in his shoes. 

Your style is cool. You look like a queen. Do exactly what you want even if others don’t validate it. Hold your beautiful head high. 

Have a wonderful time at prom!",70
858,tl4uwe,nothxim,"Sib, I see your comments saying your boyfriend says it’s too much for much. Sib for my prom I wore I dress similar to this in a lime green color that looked like Princess Tiana’s dress. My dress was huge, even a bit bigger than yours. I had to hold half of it up anytime I walked and I took up the whole back seat of a car by myself. But I loved every second of it. 

I definitely didn’t look like any other girl there, but I looked great, like you do in your dress! Just because things haven’t been done before doesn’t mean we can’t do them! It’s good to be different sometimes and I think this is one of those times sib! You should wear the dress and for future don’t let your boyfriend influence what you wear! I know you think he’s just being helpful, but I think he should be happy to see his girlfriend look amazing in a very stunning dress no matter if it has been done before or not.  

Sending you a lot of love sib <3

Be glorious my princess! Accessorize, get your hair done, experiment with new makeup with friends. Let nothing stop the fun and anticipation of prom night! 
At my equivalent of prom night we had a couple girls dump their partners right before the whole prom event, one of the guys in our grade escorted anyone who wanted a partner but didn't have one. Some girls walked on their own to hog in the limelight.
There's only one wrong way to do prom, and I'll tell you if you like. The way to do prom wrong: spend the whole time worrying about other people. Have your friends backs, of course. But don't let anyone take your fun from you!

Your dress is beautiful, I hope your boyfriends criticisms get easier to ignore so you can get back to loving your gown!",6

It fits you so well and I bet you just shine in it, BUT someone is trying to dull your shine and undermine your confidence (which is 90% of looking good) and I hate that for you. 
What is the deal with your boyfriend because what he’s doing isn’t kind, and you deserve better. 
Maybe he’s intimidated by how good you look, maybe he’s controlling, maybe he wants to hurt you because a confident you doesn’t need him, idk but none of these makes him a good person. Even if he genuinely dislikes the dress that’s his problem and a supportive boyfriend would tell you you’re beautiful in a plastic bag.

Going alone is fine, going with someone who make you feel bad, cheap or any kind of negative emotion to an event that you will remember till you drop is not worth it.

Unless he's the one wearing the dress, he doesn't get much say! Don't let him bully you over something as little as clothes. If you two are old enough for prom, he is old enough to know he has no business grousing about your beautiful dress and ought to keep his mouth shut. 

I'd talk with him, pick his brain a bit. Why doesn't he like it, specifically? If he doesn't give you a real, honest answer, you can tell him he can go to prom alone.

It is your prom night and you should go dressed however you want. He has a right to dislike the dress, and he could have expressed this in a much better way. However, he just going to have to deal with it. Do what makes YOU happy.

Side note. I never once had a date or a boyfriend who ever said anything negative about what I was wearing, not ever. My husband will tell me if he likes something or not if I ask him, but that’s it. No boyfriend worth his salt would say anything but the truth in this case:  YOU LOOK AMAZING! (Whether or not he likes the dress, you are gorgeous in it). It’s not his dress, he doesn’t have to wear it, it’s not for him, it’s for you. Please PLEASE don’t dress yourself to please others, especially men. It is fine to take into consideration their opinions, their likes and dislikes, but ultimately it is your body, wear what you like, what makes you comfortable. 

That said, I know my husband doesn’t like certain styles of clothes and prefers some colors than others, so I usually don’t buy anything he’d hate, but I’m never compromising what I like, what looks good on me, or what’s comfortable to appease his tastes or opinions.

I know this is mom for a minute, and I'm a dad, but the boyfriend is in fact allowed to have an opinion about things he is a part of. You're right, it's not just his prom, it's hers. But, it's not *just* hers either. Come on. 

My girlfriend keeps buying gray clothes. I hate gray. Gray clothing makes her look blahs and she looks much prettier in light blue or salmon, or olive green, and I tell her so. Should she dump me? We're not together or cancel our plans because of our opinions of the others clothing. Ridiculous.

If you had plans to go together before you bought the dress, I think it would have been best to collaborate before purchasing anything. It'll be a good lesson for the future. That being said, it's apparent you love this dress and he will just have to suppress his negative feelings for it. You'll have to be okay about his feelings, too.

The only thing that should be taken into account with him is color so that you two can match, and that’s only IF you guys decided you wanted to. Everything else, he can shut up about for one night if you like it. It’s a beautiful dress, and I hope prom is amazing for you! 

P.s. saw a comment saying that he thought it wasn’t formal and was “too much for prom”  does he want you to wear a Bond Woman dress or something? My senior prom dress was a pink between neon coral and hot pink, with a bedazzled bodice and in my memory it sticks out about three feet around my frame at all time. My sister’s senior prom dress was a corset top princess ball gown in lavender with purple roses on the waist. My other sister’s dress is like an Elle woods special, skin tight and low cut with a slit up her side, sequined entirely in hot pink. There is no such thing as “too much” for prom",2

1068,tl4uwe,Awesummzzz,"I'm a mid-20s dude from the front page so I'm not a great mom, but maybe a guy's opinion will give some perspective. 

I really like the dress! The color is a really nice choice, not too flashy, but not boring. All the detailing is really pretty too. You did a good job, it's perfect for prom",2
1069,tl4uwe,purpl3matrix7,Dress is freaking amazing!,2
1070,tl4uwe,mynameisCB,Your bf can suck a fart out of my ass. That dress is gorgeous and perfect for prom. Wear it and don't look back.,2
1071,tl4uwe,KryptonToKryptids,Sib here. That dress is amazing on you. Your boyfriend is wrong. You look so beautiful and the design suits you.,2
1072,tl4uwe,k_mnr,That is a gorgeous dress. Absolutely stunning. You look beautiful and the color is exquisite! Dump the boyfriend.,2
1073,tl4uwe,Mountain_Calla_Lily,You kind of look like a princess,2
1074,tl4uwe,cauldron_bubble,"It looks like a Cinderella dress! It's very flattering to your figure!! But you should wear what makes you happy on your prom day, OP.... I bought my daughter 2 prom dresses so she had one and a backup, just in case.... I wish I could do the same for you!",2
1075,tl4uwe,Joya_Sedai,"I love the style and the color. If you spent a lot of money on it, I'm sure you didn't choose it in haste, and really loved it when you made the decision to purchase it. 

Never let anyone else tell you something you love is not nice/pretty/enjoyable/etc. It is a lovely dress, looks beautiful on your frame, I love the floral embellishments, the color is a beautiful shade that I've never really seen on a prom dress. It is unique, and gorgeous.",2
1076,tl4uwe,sanityjanity,"It's lovely, and it fits you perfectly.    


It might be worth having a heart-to-heart with the boyfriend about how he is making you feel over his critique of the dress.  Surely, in the long run, how you feel is far more important than the color or cut of a dress?",2
1077,tl4uwe,Ok_Establishment1727,"Baby girl, you look absolutely stunning in that dress!!!!  In my experience, people who decide to bring you down instead of up, are not worth your time.  You’re young and have so much life ahead of you—focus on what you want, what you need, and your dreams because 20 years from now, they likely won’t be in your life anymore but the choices you make now can and could affect you for the rest of your life.

Long story short.  The dress is beautiful and your boyfriend should make you feel good about yourself, not questioning yourself.",2
1078,tl4uwe,,"It's fine. Also it's prom. It's a big deal to you but overall even if it wasn't a nice dress it's not going to matter 10 years from now. Or even 2. The point of it is to enjoy yourself.

The dress compliments your figure, is an ok neutral color (it shouldn't really be black or white which it's not but also who cares even if it was so it's fine), and has some basic embroidery that really accentuates it while not being too much.

This is honestly nicer than it needs to be

Like it's a perfectly nice dress. Your boyfriend perhaps is insecure about prom? Or if he did this often he just might not be very nice. Ether way think about it",2
1079,tl4uwe,tiddayes,"Dad here.  It is lovely.  If he can’t see that you look your best in a dress that you like, then he cannot appreciate the beauty that you have inside and out.  You can do better",2
1080,tl4uwe,adriesty,"No regrets darling. Keep the dress and get a boyfriend who understands that, as long as you're happy and healthy, his opinion of your body and style should be ""if you like, I like it"".

If you can ditch the boy and go to prom with your bffs instead, you'll probably have a better time anyway. I know I did.",2
1081,tl4uwe,FwogInMyThwoat,"This dress is gorgeous!  I stopped scrolling to look at it closer because it’s so pretty.  Had never even heard of this sub and was confused for a minute until I read your caption.

1082,tl4uwe,a201597,"This dress is gorgeous and it looks so beautiful on you! Tell your boyfriend when he’s wearing a dress to prom, he can pick that one",2
1083,tl4uwe,w3bkinzw0rld,"I will not lie to you—it isn’t what my high school would have considered prom attire (I come from the South and everything is weird here), but I LOVE it. The fit, the color, the embroidery… wow. Tell your boyfriend to get over himself.",2
1084,tl4uwe,shinoharakinji,What the fuck is wrong with your boyfriend?,2
1085,tl4uwe,stars0001,"No honey you look like Cinderella and it’s not your boyfriends call. Embrace the fact that you look like a character from a fairy tale! This is your magical night and the boyfriend can suck it up - he’ll love the dress once he sees the way you light up wearing it, that’s all that should count 💕",2
1086,tl4uwe,TkOHarley,"Ill be honest. The dress is pretty good! Like when I looked at it I thought ""oh that's quite nice actually."" 

 Guessing your boyfriend was expecting one of those bland SL fit dresses that shows off more of your lower figure. That's the general trend these days. Of course that's just my assumlption. 

In any case, your boyfriend has the wrong expectations. That's ok we all have our expectations. What's wrong is that he is chiding you for the dress, saying it's ugly. Nothings wrong with honest opinion but he is showing a lack of care or candour. 

Basically, it sounds like your boyfriend has some maturing to do",2
1087,tl4uwe,veggiezombie1,If he doesn’t like your dress then he can wear one he likes to prom.,2
1088,tl4uwe,redmusic1,"Your boyfriends issue is that if you wear that, he wont be able to wear his metallica t=shirt and 3 week unwashed jeans, and he may have to clean his teeth, seriously, you look awesome, he should be proud to have you on his arm in that but obviously he is a lazy arsed dick who thinks "" if she wears that, she will look great, which means i have to make an effort- i dont like making an effort"", wear the dress, ditch the guy, you will eventually anyway.",2

The style is lovely. YOU LOOK GORGEOUS. I don't think there are any problems with the dress whatsoever. I do think there is a problem with anybody who thinks there is a problem with the dress- full stop.
Don't let other people doubt your own worth. 
I hope you have a wonderful time at the dance, with whomever you choose to be with.",2

1094,tl4uwe,hellcats69,You look gorgeous and will have a stunning night. I agree that your boyfriend may be in awe at how amazing you look but if that is his pattern then I would look hard at where your life will go with him. You are beautiful and worthy of great things. Now go and get them.,2
1095,tl4uwe,Wizardling,"If he truly respects you, he would support your choice of dress and the happiness it gives you. I mean it's not like there's anything about this dress that a reasonable person could find offensive. So what is his problem?",2

1104,tl4uwe,grapesafe,"It’s beautiful! Prom is not a “casual” thing, love! You’re supposed to go all out and look like a Hollywood star, which you’re doing perfectly! It sounds as though he thinks you’ll look out of his league (which you already are, but as we know a man’s ego is very fragile). If you want to wear it, which I think you should, don’t let a stupid man tell you not to. It’s beautiful and it’s YOU, and if he doesn’t like it he can go find another prom date.",2

(Ps don’t trust your bf on fashion, most men are in over their head there.  And at that age I’d guess his fashion experience is what t-shirt to wear with his jeans and sneakers everyday)",2
1110,tl4uwe,DangerFloof94,"Not a mom, but I can be a virtual older sister… my input? You look like a modern Cinderella. I love the detail, the color, and the neckline. It has such a classic and unique look as well and fits nicely! 

Boys at that age are not too bright. But never date a boy who makes you feel insecure. Take it from someone who has made that mistake many times over. It’s not worth it, esp when there are guys out there who will make you feel like the most beautiful woman around. I promise you that.",2

1121,tl4uwe,magneticeverything,"Here’s a little secret I didn’t know in high school, but wish I did: all outfits are like 90% confidence and comfort. If you feel comfortable, you’ll look comfortable, which will in turn make your prom photos stand the test of time. 

Put it on and stand in front of a mirror, admire how it looks on you. Check out all your best angles and note all the all the details you fell in love with when you first put it on and decided it was the One. Dance around like you’re Mia Thermopolis at her ball and admire how the skirt swishes around you.

If it makes you feel beautiful, it’s the right dress for you.",2

A boyfriend who tears you down is not worth your time.  Surround yourself with people who life you up.

1128,tl4uwe,lolabunny5,"I'm sorry, but I don't think it's a nice dress. It seems old fashioned and gaudy. Why should your boyfriend lie to you? He has a right to his opinion. If he loves you, it won't matter that he hates the dress-- but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a right to an opinion. For example, my husband loves me and how I look, but if I wear something a little much, he might say something. I not his opinion, but whether I actually change or not is up to myself. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. And once I choose to continue to wear it, he might drop it or he might tease a little, but it's all in good fun and I know he doesn't really care that much. At the end of the day, do what makes you happy. Fashion is subjective so of course some will like it and some won't. And btw, personally, I would appreciate if my boyfriend felt comfortable to communicate w me. As long as it doesn't become a pattern of him hating your clothes; at that point he just may not be compatible with you.",6

1197,tl4uwe,meow_witch,"I used to work in a prom dress store, so I can say without a doubt that this in no way ""too much for prom."" I've seen dresses with cut outs. $1000 dresses. Dresses that poofed out 6 inches from the wearers sides and required petticoats. 

The color matches your skin tone marvelously. And the fit is gorgeous. It's elegant and literally looks like a dress out of a fairy tale.",1
1198,tl4uwe,GhostfaceKiliz,"Older sister chiming in.

Honey bee, that dress looks beautiful, and you are wearing that dress, the dress isn't wearing you! Aka- you look amazing!

Also, when are you ever going to get the chance to wear it again? (Although, I could definitely see it turned into a calf-length dress for fancy parties in the future, like a 50s-era housewife dress.)

Prom is absolutely the time to celebrate yourself and to wear pretty/ fancy clothes. The only other time you'd get the chance is if/ when you get married.

You need to remind yourself what it felt like when you put it on. Remember how you felt and how you imagined yourself going to prom in that dress.

Don't let your boyfriend ruin the moment for you. He should be lifting you up.

And if he has a differing opinion, tell him he can take it up with me.

With lots of love, Older Sis.",1

I wore a fluffy prom dress that other people said I would regret. It was bright lime green, and looked exactly like a Tinkerbell dress only it was floor length. 

I didn't regret it. I ROCKED that dress. A decade plus later I love it more than I did then!! WEAR THE DRESS! The memories of wearing this grass will last forever, this boy obviously won't 

This dress is classic, elegant, and timeless. You're not going to look back a decade from now and say why the fuck was I wearing that like some of your classmates will!!

1223,tl4uwe,AnnieOakleyLives,This dress looks beautiful on you. It fits you so well. Women can wear what they choose to wear. Men do not own our bodies. Like others have said you rarely get to wear these pretty dresses in life. Prom and wedding. Wear the dress and have a good time. It’s not appropriate to say what I did at my proms and after. Lol,1
1224,tl4uwe,sparkpaw,"Sweetie, that dress is STUNNING on you! It compliments your complexion and is such a unique and bold color. It’s absolutely gorgeous, and, as a small pro tip, if you love it enough, save it for your wedding. That’s what I did. You’ll save a TON more money, and unless you’re very traditional, you do not HAVE to have a white dress for a wedding. 

Also, ask yourself if YOU love the dress? My prom dress made me feel like the woman I had become when I was normally (and still am) very “Tom boyish”. If you FEEL great and you LOVE that dress, then own it! Be all of the you that you want to be, because you don’t get many chances to just have fun and be beautiful. 

Also, tell your boyfriend he should work on his emotional intelligence.",1

1232,tl4uwe,Breeanntheconqueror,You look like you a princess! I wish my prom dress had been this beautiful. You look amazing. You’re boyfriend is more than likely upset because he thinks you’ll look better than him at the prom. Some high school boys have a complex and want to feel superior to their partners.

That dress looks absolutely gorgeous on you, the color is amazing, and the lace is just pulling your glamor all together. That boy can get his opinions out all he wants, but this is not his decision. Prom is supposed to be a time for you to have fun and dress up. In my opinion, go all out and get some glittery jewelry from Icing (or equivalent) to finish the look. Be a princess. A Queen. Be fabulous!",1

Yours is classy and fits you perfectly!  Be happy with your own dress- my mom and sister (who has opposite tastes from me) picked out my dress on a trip to the states.  Hated it and looked bad in it.  You like yours and look good in it-  much better way to remember your prom.  Good luck on your decision!",1

I'm 95% sure if you accidentally tear it or something singing cartoon mice will appear and mend it. Don't get too freaked out when the cartoon birds bring you a floral crown to wear with it.

If your boyfriend doesn’t see the gorgeous woman he’s lucky enough to go to prom with, fuck him! He doesn’t deserve you. You have an amazing sense of style. If he makes you change anything, don’t let it be your mind about this dress. Change your mind about going with him.

Know you look incredible and have a great night.

Why doesn’t he like the color? Not his top choice? Fine tough luck. Did he want to match ties to your dress? Well he can wear silver/gray/black. I think this tone of blue isn’t going to limit his choices a ton. 

How did you feel when you tried it on and bought it? Amazing? Then remember that. If your boyfriend can’t put his opinions aside and tell you look beautiful at prom, then group up with your best friends and dance the night away, sis! 🤍",1

1312,tl4uwe,mizurisana,"Hi, I have grown up and got educated somewhere where the concept or idea of prom or even something similar did not exist. But I have lived in places and have had enough friends to completely understand the high emotions surrounding prom. So firstly, you are really lucky that you are going to prom. Tell that to yourself at least inside your head because it is really true. You are very lucky that you are getting to go to prom. Secondly, this is a once-in-a-lifetime event and you just want to feel good and have fun, right? Trust me, once the big day kicks off, all that's really going to matter is whether you're having feel-good fun and bonding with folks whom you want to remember for a long time, and the good moments of this day is going to linger in your memories even when you grow old. As long as you're feeling good and beautiful in whatever you want to wear, the dress seriously should not matter or even figure anywhere in determining whether you're going to have a blast. You're going to rock that dress and you're going to have a blast. Period. Boyfriends or friends or anybody who tries to pull your confidence down: it's time to show them that they don't matter in the long run. Your memories of this day are the only ones you're going to carry with yourself for the rest of your life from this prom. Even the dress can get old or torn but the memory remains; so it's their loss if they don't want to be a part of that positive experience.",1

Imagine my surprise to see this lovely young lady was you! I can imagine your joy in finding it, the dress, the perfect prom dress of your dreams! It's an amazing moment in a young woman's life, and I don't usually talk like that as you know lol but your boring old mom still remembers the day she found that black velvet princess seamed gown and how spectacular it felt. it felt like joy and beauty and dreams and youth.
So your post broke my heart and you should never ever feel like this. He shattered your beautiful confidence and peed all over your joy.
as your mother, I say with great sincerity, fuck that guy. Maybe he's young and dumb, maybe he's just a jerk, but until he can learn to be proud of being with such a beautiful young woman, he doesn't deserve to be. go with a friend, go with your dog, go with me… But you go in that dress and you find your smile again.",1

1473,tl4uwe,AgitatedFennel6427,A good dress you can wear for years or put up and save for a daughter maybe. But boys are a dime a dozen and if he had any brain cells he would only think about how fabulous you look instead of disliking the color. Dump him and dance your little heart out at the prom,1
1474,tl4uwe,moonkittiecat,"This is resplendent and ravishing. I’m sorry his words have started to steal your joy.

It’s much more likely you’ll still have the dress, not the boyfriend so wear the hell out of it.",1

Makes a beautiful waist and is also not a plain boring dress, but has a lot of chic to it!

1526,tl4uwe,Paleontologist-Flaky,Wow these comments…. He’s allowed to have an opinion on the dress ffs. “Tell your bf to shut his face”…. Really?  You’d all rather he lied to her?  Healthy way to be in a relationship I’m sure.,1
1527,tl4uwe,SilverChips,"Looks lovely. I would pair it with very old Hollywood looking hair and makeup If it was me.

1531,tl4uwe,silentsaturn91,"Big sister here. Your boyfriend is 100% talking out of his ass and deserves a foot kick to his for all the snide remarks he’s been making about your dress. The colour is lovely. It’s a very pretty grey toned green colour and the embroidering on it is stunning. It hugs your figure in all the right places, shows off your shoulders and neck quite beautifully, and it looks sufficiently twirly in the skirt, perfect for a night at prom.

In all seriousness, tell you soon to be ex boyfriend to pound salt. Go rock your prom❤️

Edit, spelling.",1

1533,tl4uwe,StockAlbatross969,"You look beautiful and have very good taste. The dress is classic, gorgeous and fits you perfectly.

1551,tl4uwe,Illustrious_Swan4251,Omg this dress is perfect!,1
1552,tl4uwe,sarradarling,"Honey, the pressure to fit in is insane now, even worse than it always was before due to social media. This is a normal, pretty dress. He's probably just getting a prickly feeling because he's worried it isn't normal and doesn't fit the mold of what you'd see people on social media typically wearing. In most cases I think what's popular is more about looking sexy than beautiful. This dress is more about being beautiful and classic. Notice none of those words change the purpose of the dress. It's a formal dress, and perfectly fine for this kind of dance. 

Side note, why even listen to him at all? Your body is your body and you need to decorate it in ways that make you happy. You chose a formal dress in order to conform to the event. Beyond that you should be picking whatever you enjoy!

For this particular dress I'd be inspired by old school Taylor swift and do big dramatic curls and embrace the pretty, elegant vibes. If you go to a dance and other girls have dresses that are more trendy/sexy, you'll just look like a queen! Nothing wrong with that.

But if you did spend a lot of money and you aren't sure you like how it looks then absolutely change it out! There's no point if it doesn't make you happy. Just do it for you!",1
1553,tl4uwe,TrailingKat,"The dress is gorgeous, it suits your skin tone wonderfully. If your boyfriend has a problem its because he is insecure at your level of beauty and he cannot fathom the idea of rising up to the level of beauty you exude, and because he is aware others will be looking at you and is trying to make you smaller.

Dont let him dim your light, you were born to shine just as bright as every other star that is dancing in the sky. Wear it. You are absolutely perfect in it.",1
1554,tl4uwe,AoDx888,Do you love it? Yes? Then don't let anyone else bring you down about it. The only opinion that matters is yours. ❤,1
1555,tl4uwe,Plastic_Property2551,"This may be off the mark as I don’t know OP’s bf, but I have noticed a trend where boys want their dates to wear slinky, sexy dresses. More like you’d see at a Hollywood red carpet event. Not all girls are comfortable or confident in a dress like that but do it for their date. 

I think you look gorgeous. It’s a lovely color, has tasteful and attractive beadwork, and the flowy fabric does give a princess vibe. If you love it, wear it. Don’t let him influence your decision. 

Take the dress out today, put it on, and see how it makes you feel. If you feel beautiful, then his opinion is irrelevant.",1
1556,tl4uwe,42Daft,Oh Sweetie!  That is a beautiful dress and you look wonderful in it!,1

1562,tl4uwe,wozblar,"Nope, it looks great. And he's not right or wrong in this case, he just has an opinion on your dress. 

Your dress - not his - so all that matters is how you feel about it. Were you comfortable with the amount you spent? Do you love how it looks and feels? Doesn't hurt to think about different aspects of it. At the end of the day go with how you feel, not how someone else feels.",1

1571,tl4uwe,BlackWolfEclipse,Beautiful dress! Boyfriend needs a reality check.,1
1572,tl4uwe,LilkaLyubov,"Sweeetheart. The day is for you to feel like the beautiful and amazing woman that you are becoming. Choose the dress that you want. The one you picked is lovely. Particularly because it’s you who makes it so. 

Your boyfriend is entitled to his opinion, sure, but he is not entitled to stomp over your prom wishes. This is something I wish I learned sooner. No man should outright pick what you wear and try to change it if he is not your parent teaching you what to appropriately wear (like, telling toddler you to not take your princess costume into a bath appropriate!), or giving input on what may be socially acceptable for a given occasion. You should be the final authority on what you choose to wear, and any partner should not be pressuring you to change, especially when your choice is acceptable (and yours is more than acceptable for the prom!!). That can be a red flag for many relationships depending on how they go about it. 

Just be careful. Have a good time. You are going to look great. And if he keeps telling you what to wear.",1
1573,tl4uwe,,"It's beautiful! You do you, fuck whatever anyone else thinks 🥰",1
1574,tl4uwe,Tjognar,Your boyfriend is wrong. That dress is fantastic.,1

1576,tl4uwe,Imagineraptors,You look like Cinderella. He sucks. Get a new bf not a new dress,1
1577,tl4uwe,Yoshi0210,"Wearing the dress when trying it on and wearing the dress with a full wardrobe are two different things. Men don’t know what they’re saying sometimes. There’s been times where my bf won’t like something I bought either but I’ll say just wait til the final product. He always regrets judging so quick. 
Find a good bra or try bra tape to support the girls so you can maintain the strapless look, go light on the makeup (focus on your lashes), and pair it with a cute hairstyle and shoes you like :) 
I hope you have a lot of fun. If your bf doesn’t like it by prom then tell him to get lost and you go find another guy or girlfriend to dance with.",1
1578,tl4uwe,L0urd101,I absolutely love the color. I'd get my Fiance to wear this if I could ever find it,1
1579,tl4uwe,CeelaChathArrna,"It's beautiful and you absolutely should tell your jerk of a boyfriend who is tearing you down to suck it. Personally I'd this is how he treats you now, reconsider if this is how you want to spend your life. He's already making your question reality and destroying the live you have for a dress. There are so many other guys your age that would treat you with the love, respect and kindness you deserve.",1
1580,tl4uwe,Casingda,"That’s so pretty!  I love the style.  Your boy-friend needs to talk to me.  I’ll tell him that this style is a throwback and is timelessly beautiful.  You look great in it hon!  He needs to accept that it’s what you chose and that it looks beautiful on you, too.",1

1590,tl4uwe,LaCroix_Lime,You and the dress are beautiful,1
1591,tl4uwe,AMothraDayInParadise,"Listen, that color is gorgeous on you, the cut is fantastic. It hits you perfectly at the natural waist and the fuller skirt is not too full, so it looks like with the fabric you'll get great swish factor. Against a partner in a black suit, or even just a white shirt and black or even tan pants, you'll pop. 

The neckline is to DIE for. It's not to low, but it's not nun territory and the support straps are simple and discrete. Any flower that they pick up as a corsage in the classic shades (If you still do that sort of thing) Be it pink, red, white, a pale cream etc etc will match with that dress. 

You, are going to be gorgeous, you have chosen quite honestly even better that I chose for my wedding dress and you will be great. 

Seriously, the beading... I keep going back to the first picture.  It's lovely, it's most certainly formal and you need to take a deep breath and stand back for a moment and appreciate how stellar you chose for a prom dress. Seriously.",1

Idk from reading one paragraph on Reddit I’m only going off my own experiences.

And I know you probably want him to like it because you want him to think you look beautiful, which I understand. Well guess what: you do look beautiful! You look stunning!

A boyfriend worth keeping, if he knew you like the dress, would NEVER tell you anything other than  how beautiful you look in it. It doesn’t matter if it isnt his favorite style. He wouldn’t hurt your feelings or put you in a position to doubt yourself like this. 

He gets a pass as a human because of his age. He’s young, he’s allowed yo be stupid while he grows. He does NOT get a pass from me as your boyfriend. There are plenty of guys that regardless of their youth would have never dared to put down your dress like this.

Make no mistake. Your dress is fine. It fits amazingly well and you look absolutely great in it. The boyfriend making you doubt tgat? NOT FINE.",1

That being said, your boyfriend is certainly entitled to his own opinion. But there's a very important life lesson he clearly hasn't learned yet: he should have kept his mouth shut. Liking someone means liking them for who they are, and being happy for them when they are happy.  You like the dress clearly, and from his perspective, that should be all that matters.

And obviously this applies in vice versa too. Say he shows up in a bright red top hat and tails, beaming from ear to ear. What would be the right thing to do? To crush his enjoyment by telling him how stupid he looks? Or humor him and let him have his fun? This is all basic respect for and acceptance of others for who they are.",1

1761,tl4uwe,ladyradar,Baby your prom dress is beautiful and you look beautiful in it. Might be time to throw the whole boy away. Boyfriends are like pancakes - no shame in throwing them away if they're a little messed up.,1

Your boyfriend is entitled to his opinion but he was being pretty dumb to flat out tell you he doesn’t like it. You tell him it’s your dream dress and you love it and if he’s truly bothered then you don’t need to take a date at all. 

I hope your prom is absolutely wonderful. You rock that dress, girl!",1

I wouldn't listen to your boyfriend's opinion, there are a lot of things that individuals don't like but that doesn't mean everyone won't like it, fashion is very subjective.

1796,tl4uwe,bcck92,Beautiful! I saw the dress before I was able to read the caption. Plz keep the dress and replace the boyfriend. Spoken from a mom that had 3 kids from the age from 22-17. Find a man that appreciates your beauty! 🙌,1

If you decide to still go to the dance with this boy, please make sure to get plenty of pictures with *just you* in addition to the usual couple's shots. I dated the same boy all through highschool and a few years after and one big regret is that I don't have any pictures from homecomings, proms, graduation etc that don't feature him. I am not going to tell you he is terrible because of one story, young men are not always known to be very tactful, but please make sure he knows that he is being hurtful and that you expect kindness from him. And do not allow a boy or man tell you what to wear. You are the boss of your own body.

Never mute your self-expression for a boy. My prom wasn’t all that long ago, and this was a common look then. You won’t be the odd one out. You will look miraculous, and if that intimidates him, oh well. He might not be a bad guy, but you look stunning and it’s really uncool that he made you feel like you don’t.

This is more a 50 year olds mother-of-the-bride dress and not a 17 year olds prom dress. I teach high school. You're not going to fit in and will probably feel awkward all night. It is 100% your choice and you look good in it.

If yes, Then everyone else can fuck right off. I learned this lesson during my senior prom: a girl in my party made a comment that my “shoes don’t match my dress.” My dress was hot pink and had multi-colored floral beading all over. I had red shoes. They absolutely matched.

1893,tl4uwe,fearthebanshee,"Whoa now, let’s slow down recommending this young girl dump her boyfriend just before prom based on one post that assuredly does not demonstrate the entirety of their relationship. First, cut the boy a little slack. Adult men are not known for their tact, let alone teenage boys. Second, boys/men can and do have opinions about fashion. Lots of women don’t like these kinds of dresses, for lots of reasons. It’s not surprising that men would have similar opinions. I bet he was going for a form fitting dress for fairly obvious reasons. And last, it is a normal part of any relationship, no matter the age, to deal with differences of opinion. I am sure most of us have some version of the “college couch” or “bunny onesie” that we love and our spouse wants to burn. But that couch is still in your basement and you still rock those pj’s. Why? Because there is a balancing act between how much you hate it and how much it means to them. But that always starts with communicating how you feel. If he just states his opinion and didn’t descend into pressuring her or insulting her personally, then that’s ok. She can still choose to override him if she loves her dress and feels confident in it (it is lovely btw). She can also decide that his opinion outweighs her feelings. Both are legitimate and dealing with conflict in a respectful manner is a good life lesson. Again, though, if he was super rude or demanding, that is different and she should totally throw him out with the bath water. She didn’t indicate I her post that he had gone that far, so I am not going to immediately crucify the poor boy for having the gall to be honest with her. That’s really all we know here.",1
1894,tl4uwe,Ann_Summers,"Never, ever, ever, let someone make you feel bad when your felt beautiful. Especially someone who is supposed to care about you. Ditch the no hood boyfriend, go to prom with a group of friends and dance your butt off, I promise you it will be more fun anyway.

Listen to me. You need to tell your boyfriend that while you appreciate his opinion, he hurt your feelings and he needs to be more considerate. The dress isn’t for him, it’s for you. If he wants to dress you up, HE can take you shopping and pay for it. Do not waste your time on boys/people who disrespect you like that, EVER.

No one else liked it and my bf ended up breaking up with me a week before prom. To this date it’s still my favorite dress. I low key think my cheetah print dress is ugly AF now, but the joy I felt from that dress was my favorite memory. Only opinion that matters is yours girl.",1

Invest little energy into anyone that doesnt appreciate you in a cardboard box but to be fair maybe he is experimenting with being a jerk to get personal power as he might have never had any. Tell him no thanks on his unhelpful opinion and do whatcha like.,1

More importantly: When you put it on, you felt like a million bucks. You felt beautiful and confident. Then he opened his mouth and took that power away from you. If he doesn't like it, then he can buy his own dress and wear it to the prom. If he didn't pay for it and isn't going to wear it, he can keep his opinion to himself.

Make sure to get plenty of photos solo or just with your friends. In group shots, make sure he's at the very edge of the picture. (Just future planning.)",1
1942,tl4uwe,Britthighs,"Dress is beautiful I love the detail and you must of picked it because you loved how you felt in it.

1957,tl4uwe,lzc2000,The dress looks great. You chose it and someone else’s opinion shouldn’t alter you being happy about it. You and your boyfriend are young. Just kindly explain to him that you like it and you can respect that he doesn’t like it but it’s too late now so we should just put it aside and enjoy the evening.

Boyfriend needs to rent a tux to keep up and is bitching about it.

Have fun. It's your night.",1

Are you ""allowed"" to give *your* honest opinion to your SO, or do you just always say whatever they picked is perfect?  Do you think it's wrong for *you* to tell your SO a shirt doesn't look good, or their pants aren't a good match?",1

I would think about what drew you to this dress in the first place and make a decision that way instead of thinking about what someone else thinks about it. At the end of the day, you would be wearing it, not your boyfriend and you deserve to feel pretty and confident at prom. 

Did your boyfriend say what they didn’t like about it? Like if it had to do with the neckline you could wear a shawl (I know it’s not super modern but it’s what my mom always recommended when I was younger).

You are perfect just as you are, and the right one will see that. Change yourself for no one but yourself. Have fun at prom love! This is a very memorable time of your life. This young man is giving off red flags, but I do understand he’s young and maybe doesn’t know better. This isn’t saying he’s a bad person, but don’t get too invested.

2069,tl4uwe,Honey_81,"No, sweetheart, your dress has a classically innocent appeal to it that you wear beautifully. 
Could the reason your boyfriend doesn't like your dress possibly be because he feels unworthy? Or possibly because he doesn't have extra money with which to impress you? Talk to him about it..",1

2082,tl4uwe,Mediocre-County7980,the dress looks beautiful! Never got to have my prom because of covid and definitely wanted to go for a princess esque dress if i did! so i’m jealous af at the dress! however what’s not cute is a boyfriend who makes you feel insecure and doesn’t appreciate beauty because he’s too stuck on what others might think (saw ur comment on his reasons for hating it)! girly make those kids drop dead at your beauty and live the royal life you deserve with that dress!,1
2083,tl4uwe,Crystal_Dawn,"I was scrolling and though this dress was from one of the sewing subreddits, and thought ""holy shit, that is AMAZING"" then I read that you were second guessing it, and with the number of comments here I hope you see that your taste is exceptional.

2084,tl4uwe,wanderingl0st,"Unless he’s the one wearing it, he needs to keep his mouth shut. You like it, it looks great, keep the dress, ditch the boyfriend. I don’t understand partners having an opinion on choices about someone’s body, hair, clothes, makeup etc. A family friend had long thick hair that she hated but would never cut because her husband is an insecure “manly” guy and would throw a fit if she did. And she couldn’t wear heels because he’s short. Outside of major life choices in a relationship, do/wear what your comfortable with.",1

What's most important, though, is that *you* like it. Him not being happy simply that *you* like the dress you are wearing to prom is *his* problem, not yours. He has his own outfit that he can control (and do you negatively opine on *his* clothing choices?). 

He ought to be more supportive. That he's not should give you serious doubts about *him*, not your dress.",1

2100,tl4uwe,GandalfDGreenery,"That dress is beautiful! You'll be gorgeous in it, and if your boyfriend is telling you he doesn't like it, then I don't think his taste is worth taking into account. And even if he doesn't like the dress, telling you that you look beautiful in it, and that your confidence makes you glow could have been a really easy win for him, but he chose to put you down and criticise your taste instead. 

Choose the dress that makes you feel great, not the boyfriend who makes you doubt yourself. 

I hope you have a great time at prom!",1
2101,tl4uwe,PassengerNo1815,No. It’s perfectly lovely. The color looks good with your skin and it fits nicely. Your boyfriend can go suck an egg.,1

2116,tl4uwe,OtherwiseJello,"I don't know why he thinks it's wrong for Prom. From my experience, it's exactly the kind of dress you'd wear to this event. I think there's a trend to wear cocktail dresses to prom and that's what he's thinking of, but IMO, those just aren't fancy enough. The whole point of prom is to dress up fancy and look your best, and the boy wears a tuxedo or special suit. 

Your boyfriend doesn't know what he's talking about. Keep the dress, get a new boyfriend.",1
2117,tl4uwe,MrDickPickles,Tbh I’m a guy and it looks kindof bad. Don’t listen to these single ladies. They just want you to be single. He should make himself good for you just as you should make yourself for him!! If he likes a different colour ask him but he should also ask for your opinion. Communication is key 🔐,1

Keep the dress, and if he doesn't start acting right, then start shopping for a new prom date (or just go stag, or do what i did and take a good friend as a date).

Kinda weird how it's got so much going up too and then plain Jane on the bottom. But that's just 2 men's opinions. And instead of immediately cutting off your boyfriend's head because I'm a lonely spinster, a person might ask if he did anything to deserve it. Not liking a dress does not make someone evil.

2223,tl4uwe,bloody_dutch,"My dear, the dress is enchantingly beautiful. Yes, it doesn't look simple or elegant. But it is your dress. Your dress is about you, not about what other people wants to see. Wear it because you feel beautiful in it. 

The choice of embroidery, colour and fabric spells magical. That means you are nothing but magical. Tell your boyfriend that's who you are. And if he didn't want to acknowledge that, then find someone who will.  

Be your own Cinderella :)",1

2226,tl4uwe,dkarm,"I’ve read your comments and it seems like you’ve answered your own question, that it’s too formal for the occasion. I think people are jumping on the bandwagon to cancel your bf, but the point is being missed that you need to be comfortable and it doesn’t sound like you would be wearing this dress. Find something a bit shorter in a more youthful, fun style.",1
2227,tl4uwe,,You look amazing. Only thing I would consider losing would be the bf.,1
2228,tl4uwe,bookworthy,"Oh, it’s so pretty and fits you well! The color and cut are flattering. I’m sorry he doesn’t like it because I know it undermines your positive feelings about the dress, but don’t let him steal your joy.  Nobody has the right to impose their opinion on you. Simply tell him that it makes you so happy to wear the dress and you feel beautiful in it. He is welcome to have an opinion, too, and when he shares his opinion you can thank him for telling you how he feels. 

I caution you against changing the dress on his say-so. Doing so sets a negative, controlling precedent because really, why does he care so much about your dress? Is he insecure when you have something you like? Does he just want to bring make you feel less confident? What’s his goal?

Now if you ask his opinion and he’s like, “Meh, I don’t really like it, but you do you,” then he’s just being honest about his preferences. I frankly don’t see how he’ll be able to have that opinion after seeing his girlfriend beaming with happiness while wearing this beautiful gown.",1

But also I feel like prom is likely a wedding us guys don’t really care about the event wear and it’s mostly for the women we go so ya he a dick but also did he give reasons for not liking other than color,1

There is a lot of assumptions in this comment, and also an undeserved focus on your BF perspective. Still wanted to share that.

The dress itself is very nice, but the ornamental design of ... weeds? ... with the outline of ... ""pearls""?... destroys the natural flow of the dress. The color is very suitable for a prom as well.

You may grow out of the dress AND the boy, and you'll want to have photos of just you that doesn't also include memories of him if it's a bad breakup. It's a beautiful dress and it looks incredible on you, and you deserve to remember how you looked and felt like a princess for prom years and years from now. 

It's a perfect dress and the only one who needs to love it is you. If your boyfriend is being like that, you may also need to address some heavy stuff - partners that try to control or belittle how their partners dress or look is often an initial red flag that can lead to more things.

I’m not sure why there are so many comments asking you to dump someone who doesn’t like something you’ve done. That’s going to be an obstacle you’ll have to handle in almost any relationship.

Most prom dresses I see look overly frilly, fragile, and uncomfortable. I hated the dresses my dates wore when I was in high school. I was afraid to touch them, because it looked like they would rip in a stiff breeze. And they all hated those dresses by the end of the night, because they were uncomfortable and awkward. 

Your dress looks functional, while still being beautiful, and it looks comfortable. It looks like the sort of dress you can dance in, and enjoy a party, without wishing you could burn the damn thing by the end of the night.

So, I think you picked wisely. Have a great time at prom! Don't take it too seriously; it's just a faux-fancy party. Have fun!",1

I think that dress is fantastic, its for sure original. If you like it, you should **defiantly** wear it even if your BF does not like it.

Wear good undergarments. Earrings and necklace set ( don't go huge on the necklace). Slippers or heels you can actually stand. 

Hair up or down. Go with your face for that. 

Don't go for pointy nails (snag).

2580,tl4uwe,NJtoCA,"I vaguely remember my boyfriend not liking my jr prom dress. It was babydoll pink and had a ton of tulle and roses. What I remember most about that prom was how the dress felt and twirled. It was like being a combination ballerina and princess. Boys can be socially stupid in high school and generally have no filter. I’m not going to say ditch the boy (I married my jr prom date) but make sure this was a stupid slip of the tongue and that he wants you to be happy, not control you.",1

2584,tl4uwe,anneboleynfan1,Also what are your thoughts on elbow length white gloves?,1
2585,tl4uwe,FollowThePeople,"Sweetie, first of all, you should know that dress fits you like a glove and makes your body look stunning. Second, I do agree with all the other moms that a good guy won’t make you feel ugly or make you question simple choices, like what you wear. Abusive men tend to do this, not saying your boyfriend is like that, but it’s something to be aware of, cautious of and keep in the back of your mind as you move ahead in your relationship. If he makes you feel bad or is controlling of little choices you make often, maybe reconsider this guy. 

Third, the only thing that matters is how you feel. You need to have a good prom. Regardless of what he thinks. You need to do what will make you happy. If you can take some time alone, in front of a mirror, look at yourself. Try to push away all the thoughts and feelings put in you by others. Try to look at yourself from YOUR point of view. Do you think you look beautiful in that dress? (I do) does it make you feel good? Will it make you stand out in a good way? Will you match the level of class everyone else will be wearing too? Like is everyone wearing a fancy dress or is it more of a casual dress prom? Ask yourself all the questions and be honest with yourself about how it feels to wear that dress. If your doubts only come from the things others have said to you but you, yourself, have very little doubt and like how you look and feel comfortable, that’s your answer. 

But no matter what, check in with yourself first. This is YOUR life. You need to make it the best it can be because this is all you get. There is nothing else after you die. This is it. You’ll never get another chance to be 16 or 17 or 18. You’ll never get another chance at prom. Don’t waste your life making others happy.",1
2586,tl4uwe,mastiffmad,That’s an ugly dress.,1
2587,tl4uwe,HoldMyThrowawaysWife,Why does your boyfriend hate it? I have never meet a man that has an opinion on women’s fashion unless there is a really good reason for it… like it doesn’t fit well or something. If it’s not a really good reason like that (which I do not see that being the case because I think it looks lovely) then is he just being mean? What is his motives for saying he hates it?,1

2664,tl4uwe,CMDR_Dimadome,"Not sure if you posted in this sub for an honest opinion or just to have everyone agree with you but im of the opinion that it fits well and looks good. The embroidered pattern is cool. Personally I'm not a fan of the color, the dress as a whole is a bit old school and i would hope you didn't spend too much on it. But I would also go so far as to say if you spend your whole life trying to please other people your going to spend your whole life being disappointed. Wear what's comfortable and makes you feel good. I have some salmon colored gym shorts that look awful with everything. Idc I love them. As far as the boyfriend I know prom is a big deal for both parties and Hollywood hypes it up in a way that adds a lot of pressure so he probably had some preconceived idea of how things would look or go. All these people are victimizing him and he doesn't sound perfect but he's just a horny kid who makes mistakes and would probably prefer a leather body suit or something. I think once the night comes and you guys start that first slow dance how your dress looks will be the last thing on anyone's mind. But thats a slightly more honest take, if that's not what your after just ignore it.",1

You have great taste!

I only went to prom once and wore a dress I hated, but that my (now-ex)boyfriend and my mother liked. Don’t make my mistake! Wear what makes *you* happy because it’s *your* experience at prom. What others wear makes way less of an impact on your individual experiences, so boyfriend can shove it.",1

Your dress is very pretty, and honestly, it’s very unusual/weird for a boy to “hate” a dress so much so that he tells his girlfriend about it. 

How would he feel if when he shows up in his “unique” tux you told him “I hate what your wearing.”? He’d feel bad. And why would you honestly say such a thing? Unless…

This is about him hurting you on a very special occasion. If you’re with someone, you don’t hurt them on a special occasion over something so trivial unless you just…. don’t like them but are to insecure (lack the courage) to tell yourself and them the truth.

Sweetie, he’s either a fool or he isn’t being honest with you. You need to figure out which it is. You will have other boyfriends, but you will only ever have one or two proms.",1

Prom is your chance to dress up however you want, and it’s practically encouraged to dress like a princess. I regret toning down my prom dress, because I work in a field/live in a community that will never afford me the opportunity to dress up like that ever again. I fantasize about wearing extravagant gowns all the time, haha! Use this chance to feel like the gorgeous, elegant person you certainly look like in that dress, & enjoy your prom!

I'm so sorry that you found something that you love and the people around you didn't love it. That sucks. You look beautiful. And if you do wear it, spend time working on the bra part ahead of time. It can be really hard to find a comfortable strapless bra and you deserve to be comfortable all night.

But back to the dress - the pearls! You could get a pearl necklace that would look super cool. And the green would look really nice with the flower pieces you get for each other (I forget what they are called). Very eucalyptus vibes ya know?

Your boyfriend might be stuck in a mindset about what is and isn't prom appropriate based entirely on tv and movies, Instagram, and a handful of arbiters at your high school who have made superficial pronouncements about prom impropriety. Unless he's a fashion designer, see Zac Posen, your boyfriend probably has no clue what he's talking about.

As a caveat, I'll add that I don't think Zac Posen was all that adept at his craft during his high school years, but he was continually designing dresses for supermodels during this period and it gave him the imprimatur of competence and brilliance that weren't exactly well earned.",1

If it makes you feel happy, and beautiful, and like the confident princess you’re meant to be, then absolutely no one else’s opinion matters. Prom night and your wedding night are the two big opportunities a girl has to feel like the princess she deserves to be, and that means wearing what makes you feel comfortable and beautiful, regardless of what other people think. 

If your boyfriend has negative things to say about something that brings you joy, maybe you should think about the rest of his behaviour, though? Do you feel like he consistently lifts you up, and this is an exception, or do you feel like he often puts you down and makes you feel sad or worried about things you enjoy? You deserve a partner who is kind to you and cares about the things you care about just as much as you deserve to feel like a princess for your prom, hun. I don’t want to give you solid advice on that, because I of course don’t know your relationship, but just do a bit of thinking about it, okay?",1

This is a great opportunity to learn about how the people we choose as partners should be supportive and improve our life, not critical and upsetting. I know this is only a snapshot of your relationship, but OP, take some time to seriously consider this please and always remember to stand up for yourself, set boundaries and end relationships if they are not good for you.",1
2732,tl4uwe,bigbertha998,"Did you like it before you got his opinion? What did it make you feel? What made you buy it? The only thing that matters is whether you like it and that it makes you feel beautiful. 

Personally, the only dance I went to I chose a dress out of panic and ended up being the 6th girl at the dance. So if I could go back I would have chosen the dress that made me feel butterflies, the one that lit up my smile, fit the vibe I wanted.

So the next major dress I bought was my wedding dress. My friend and my mother took pictures.. I chose based on what vibe, what it made me feel, like, did I feel like I was playing a dress up bride? or did I feel like the bride, and the butterflies and smile? It was fasinating looking at those pictures bc even tho I debated a little bit.. in the pictures you can see exactly how it was the one! 

I debated the dress bc I had a friend in my ear that was telling me the puffy sparkly one.. I really liked it, I felt beautiful but it wasn't me. It was my friend's dream dress.
I really had to step away from her opinion and connect with my feelings about the dress. 
So take the boyfriend out of the picture, do you feel beautiful, does it feel like the dress was made for you? If not it's perfectly okay to return it, but if you do then wear it knowing that you are absolutely gorgeous.. that anything you wear is stunning but this dress is made for you and your entire being regardless of how he sees it. 

Lastly, if he cannot be supportive of you and your feelings despite different tastes, if he doesn't make you feel appreciated and beautiful even if he doesn't like the dress, then he needs to go. You deserve someone who is in awe of you whether you wear a potato sack or are covered in diamonds. Know your worth babe, and remember you make the dress, the dress doesn't make you. I personally think you look classic beautiful in the dress a little vintage you could do pinup hair and it would set you apart from everyone.

2737,tl4uwe,_Rudraksh_,Looks Gucci to me idk bout your bf,1
2738,tl4uwe,QuietlySeething,"Most important thing first:
Sweetheart, I think this dress is beautiful. 

A classic off-the-shoulder dress like that is perfect with hair cut short or pinned up (to show off that whole neckline-to-shoulder region) or with long hair down, so it works well with literally ANY hairstyle/cut. Excellent choice.

If I were you, I would look for a necklace that's a little sparkly and has maybe a longer chain, OR go on the short side and keep it around your collarbone.

Now let's talk about that boy:
I have serious concerns about anyone throwing shade on a dress that is inspired by Cinderella's ball gown, and by extension, the girl who friend ""the dress."" After all, you're not getting dressed up for him. You're getting dressed up for YOU.

How sure are you that you really care about this boy? And, completely separate from how much you may care for him, how do you feel about him undermining your confidence and putting you down this way? Some people are so insecure that they're significant other will leave them, that they use little put-downs like this to undermine your confidence. (After all, in their mind, you might leave them for a better option! The safest thing for them is to make you feel a little less valuable, so you stick with them as a ""prize."") Some adults do this and their relationships, and it's awful. Those adults don't flip a switch overnight, it starts younger than that. I'm not saying this person is necessarily a controlling / mentally abusive partner, but I'm saying it's a red flag. Please look out for more.

It is entirely possible to have somebody in your heart that is no good for you, or that doesn't care for you back in equal measure, and that is a very hard place to be.

Speaking from experience, it is entirely okay to go to the prom solo and just dance with your friends. I went solo to my junior prom, and it was SO much more fun than the senior prom with a boy stuck on my arm. He does not own your night. He does not own your fashion choices.

But I could've shown up in a trash bag and he would've happily tied on a matching one and defended the choice to anyone that gave us crap for it. He ALWAYS had my back (and still does!). That being said, you are incredibly lucky to have such a beautiful dress. The beadwork and details are stunning, the color is gorgeous and it fits you beautifully.

That's the only question that matters here sis/little cuz.  

I get why you asked what you did how you did.  Prom is a big thing and, when we're in relationships, we always want them to be happy.

However.

You picked this for a reason.  To my eye, the color and shape are flattering on you...but you picked this for you because of how you feel in it and felt it strongly enough to spend money you had access to on it.

Your boyfriend does not get a say in what makes you feel good about yourself.  He does not get to try to make you feel insecure.  He does not get to dictate how you spend your money.  

Does he want to enjoy the privilege of accompanying your fabulous looking self to the function or stay home?  This should be the only question he should be asking and he should be asking it of himself.

Re-evaluate what he's bringing to your life and have a backup plan for going without him.

you may be missing the point that she wants *other* people to think she looks good, which has the effect of making her comfortable in the dress. don't set the poor girl up for failure. if she doesn't feel like ""owning it"" in a lurid dress, don't convince her it's her job to do so. i know we all want to upvote all these positive vibes comments but it's totally inappropriate to force the square peg in the round hole all the time.",-2

2878,tl4uwe,jellybloop,"Is not what ""he"" had in mind? Honey. This isn't about him. Who does this boy think he is? Lol.... for real tho 

If you're worried about overdressing, here are my thoughts. First off, it's prom. If you're dressed up more than everyone else, I would honestly be surprised and think everyone else is underdressed. My little sister just went to prom dressed up in an equally as fancy dress and she fit right in. Usually, less fancy and shorter dresses are for homecoming. Second, even if you are overdressed, it's only awkward if you make it awkward. Unless everyone is literally in jeans and t-shirts, you just appear more regal and elegant if you do it with confidence. Confidence is what makes something look fitting for an occasion. I know that sounds like flowery mom-talk, but I'm telling you, it's actually and legitimately true-- I mean just look at the Met Gala lol. Confidence is like make-up. Makes everything you wear look amazing. 

You got this!! You look stunning and if I was at homecoming with you I would be wishing my dress looked like yours.",113

* He didn't say you are not allowed to wear it

* He didn't try to force you to wear something *he* picked

Instead, he simply told you how he felt about THE DRESS. He didn't even say it was ugly, just that it's not what he had expected for prom. The fact that he said you should still wear it because it's what *you* like shows that he understands it's not about him.

He sounds like an OK guy to me just based on what you've said here. Keep your eyes and ears open for any weirdness but, to be honest, if you don't like what he says to you or he makes you feel like shit in general, nothing is forcing you to stay with him.",2

It’s a nice dress and it looks good on you, at the end of the day all that really matters is if YOU feel good in it.

I'll also add. It's common for men to make something up when they know that there's an issue, but not know *why* there is an issue. Doesn't mean his not being a prick.

The other possibility is that he wasn't planning on doing anything this fancy.

But screw all those people who say ""it's your day not his."" Apparently a man isn't supposed to look forward to formal events, nor have an opinion about what the person they're going as. Sexist bullshit.

I for one, and everyone else here, think you look amazing and picked a beautiful dress. It fits nicely and the color is beautiful on you.

Mine looks very similar to yours but mine had enough glitter on it that I’m still finding it 16 years later! And you know what? I felt and looked like a princess in that dress. Glitter and all.

He's probably worried because of one of two things: You're going to outdress him, which means he actually has to put in effort for his own outfit to be able to stand next to your beauty. Or two, He's worried you're too beautiful and you'll catch other guys's gazes. 

Both of those are ""him"" issues that you don't need to worry about. His immaturity is showing and you can ignore it and him. 

You are beautiful. The color is gorgeous and complements you well. The details are eye catching without being overwhelming. It's a very nicely balance, giving a sense of elegance.

I am a professional photographer. My job for the last decade is to make people look good and capture that moment, so trust me when I say, you look good. (The best accessory would be to change the boy out for pearls and white gloves. )

When you are at prom, remember: shoulders back, chest up, and keep the chin down. people have a bad habit of rasing their chin to seem more confident, but it just makes them look arrogant. (And you dont want people looking up your nose.) Confidence is in the shoulders and back. 

Remember, confidence is sexy. Be proud of yourself and trust that you are lovely. Don't hang around those who try to tear down your confidence. You don't need them.

Now, I see you’re having problems with dad. Man dads are…dads are tough, aren’t they? And when they aren’t too good at being a dad to begin with it can get worse once they are doing it alone. I’m sorry that’s happening to you, you don’t deserve his terrible words and demeaning down talking. I’m sorry you are feeling so lost and alone. I’m sorry you are feeling like you shouldn’t be here. But you should be here. You are smart and funny and kind and loving. You care what others think and you worry if you are doing enough for them, that tells me you are a good person. I’m sorry Your mom wasn’t kinder to you and I’m sorry she said horrible things to you and I’m extremely sorry that you’re going this alone. 

Please hold on. Please. Find a hotline, reach out to a friend, confide in a teacher. But please, don’t give up. You. Are. Worthy. 

Your boyfriend shouldn’t be your boyfriend. He should be building you help, not helping to break you down. My dear sweet girl, I once had a high school boyfriend much like yours. Made everything seem like it was my fault. I was being stupid. I was being paranoid. I wasnt trying hard enough. I was creating drama. He would criticize what I wore if it made me look nice. He didn’t want others looking at me. He told me he was the only man who would put up with me and I started believing him. I married him. He abused me every chance he got. I’m telling you this because I want different for you. 

I want you to see how amazing you are, despite the haters and the naysayers. I think deep down, you still know you’re awesome. Look at that dress! YOU picked that gorgeous dress! And look how freaking amazing it looks on you?! You need a tiara because you look like a princess. And you know what? You deserve to look like a princess. And more than that, you deserve to be treated like the badass woman that you are. Soon this will pass, the anger and the harshness. Soon the vile words will be gone and you will be able to start out on your own. And no matter how hard that seems, you’ve made it this far, which means you can make it even farther. YOU WILL DO GREAT THINGS. I can feel it. Please don’t give up on yourself. Never, ever, EVER, let ANY man make you give up on yourself, not even your father.",1

This is definitely formal, and very elegant. It's not cocktail, which has become acceptable at proms, but it is, quite literally, the exact definition of women's formal wear. It's very in line with what we see at Matric Dances in my country, which is basically prom.  


And what's wrong with the color? It's a near-traditional women's formal wear color (see Cinderella for how long this has been in play)  


Sorry, hun. It's hard to read anything into this other than 'I wanted to perve on a girl in skyscraper heels and a bodycon cocktail dress and I am a teenage man so I'm going to flap my mouth like my opinion matters.'   


He has, quite literally, no idea what 'formal' means in women's wear (clue: It means full length dress leaning ballgown type) and too unsophisticated to divorce 'elegant' and 'sexy'.

This is a good lesson in affirming your own style and taste. You are you, you have your own styles and tastes, when you say “I like this no matter what someone else says” it will make you happy and help you carve out your ever evolving identity. In my life every time I’ve affirmed my personal taste and opinions (when they’re truly opinions at least) it’s felt more validating than most anything else.

I wish I would have had a classic like this to wear instead of the bubblegum pink and lime greens that I had on hand.

Both my parents were like “that’s… an interesting choice”. Her boyfriend didn’t care and told her to have fun. A lot of the teachers and her friends complimented her on it on the day of prom. It’s been like 15 years since, and to this day she still thinks fondly of her dress and how she stuck with that decision.

When you are glowing in a moment of confidence when you feel beautiful there's a type of man who will be amazed by you. Not your body, not your dress, the beauty of you in that moment. And there's a type of man who sees that light and needs to cut it down. Maybe he is just young and wasn't used to seeing you dressed up like that and spoke in a way that was too mean, but if he regularly makes his feelings seem more important than yours it is time to put some thought into deciding if this relationship is valuable to you.",1

Also, people who make fun of others in high school are ultimately afraid. They’re clinging to their last shreds of relevance and they know it. It’s high school and they’ve already peaked. They will never be cooler than they are right there in that moment.

So you get you a bowl, then you get some Fritos, I prefer the scoops but whatever you fancy is fine, then you get your favorite chili, I like to use my husbands homemade stuff but the can will do as well. You warm the chili, top the Fritos with the chili, add lots of shredded cheddar cheese and if you’d like, some diced onions and sliced jalapeños. Eat.",1

3276,tl4uwe,Cute-Speed5828,"Devil's advocate.  This prom at this exact school may be less extravagant. Or he probably just don't know what people wear for proms. And using a show as inspiration is a bit silly imo. But also goes to show as you say that prom is most likely extravant. 

But I 100% agree  she should wear it and talk it out.  All it probably boils down to is him being afraid of attention, while people at this age shouldn't really care about that. Enjoying the time together and having fun is all that matters. Whether you get attention or not. Wanting to be like a princess this is the perfect time for it and enjoying it no matter how anyone may or may not think.  So wear it and enjoy it!",1

3283,tl4uwe,Bushwitch,"Then he can keep his opinion to himself! She's already bought it so to say something now when she can't do anything about it but question herself only serves to take away her confidence. She obviously loved the dress. 

LPT: only give negative opinions on a person's appearance that they can fix in under a minute (there's something in your teeth, tp on your shoe, etc.). To suggest someone should go dress shopping all over again or they are too fat or something is just an insult, not helpful, often very damaging",1

3419,tl4uwe,Xanthina,"Not quite formal, but I just bought a bunch of  hobbity type clothes for me to start wearing more everyday. I am ready to just be ME, screw what anyone else things.",1
3420,tl4uwe,wwitchiepoo,"Thank and daaamn. It used to be hell! Now I have orthotics and plantar fasciitis and can only wear flats with my orthotics. The only comments I’ve ever had were from Jane Fonda herself at the Newsroom after party. She was in a suit and chain smoking with tennis shoes on. She saw my shoes and lifted her pant leg and said with a cigarette in her mouth, “hell yeah.”  That was it. Her real voice is very gravelly. It was so funny. She was just happy being comfy in her pants and tennis shoes.",10
3421,tl4uwe,pc_flying,"How long is the party?

Start in one, switch halfway through",3
3422,tl4uwe,SnappyCapricorn,Yes. Yes you are.,2
3423,tl4uwe,asanam318,India here. That dress is lovely!! Make sure you click a ton of solo pics minus the boyfriend. 😀,4
3424,tl4uwe,RyeDraLisk,"Yeah. Dress looks great @ OP, but I'm a little disappointed at everyone for bashing the boyfriend for an opinion just as valid as everyone else.

Jesus, OP herself said the boyfriend wasn't forcing her to change or had some super strong ""eww wtf is this"" opinion, why is everyone just assuming he's a creep/asshole/all of the above?",1

3431,weu7zn,OneOfManyAnts,"You know, sometimes I look at a before and after picture and I can’t tell which is which, because they both look good, but different. That was the case here on first glance, but then I realized that in one of them you’re hiding, and in the other you look so sparkling and happy. That’s so nice to see, it does my heart good. 

And have you found your way to the curly hair forums? Because you’re doing such a nice job with those curls now. I know from experience with a skill it is to get good at that. Well done!",142
3432,weu7zn,amideadyet1357,"My love you have the most beautiful smile. You look so confident and joyful, I’m so happy that you’ve made it this far on your journey! I hope, the next time you get your nails done, you take a moment to look at your hands. The hands your mother made, hands that carry her blood and her history, hands that she loved and held years ago, and you remember those hands are a part of her. You’ll never really get your nails done with out her, you are forged from her.

Thank you for sharing your absolutely stunning glow up!",777

3444,weu7zn,,"The joy I see in the right hand photo is so stunningly beautiful. It’s more than just your outward appearance, which is of course beautiful as well, but it’s a beauty that comes from being at peace with yourself. 

I am sorry that you never got the mother/daughter experience you yearned for, duckling. I know this may not help with the pain you feel at this moment, but I feel that through you is a lesson that others can learn to not be afraid to be who they are and be honest with those around you.",7

3463,weu7zn,BooBeans71,"Honey, you are STUNNING! I am truly speechless (which is a tough one for me). 

Since you can't share cooking with your birth mom, I'm gonna share one of my favorite little comfort meals. If you like the ingredients, make it in her honor and eat it with a full heart. 

Breakfast Bistro Salad (good any time of the day):

* 1-2 handfuls of arugula or spring mix
* 1 handful of leftover steak, chicken, or other meat of your choice (optional)
* 1/2 cup of a soft white bean like cannellini or great northern
* 1/2 cubed avocado
* 1 fried, poached, or scrambled egg (each will give the salad a slightly different experience, best if yolk is still runny)
* 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
* Juice of 1/2 lemon

Layer salad, meat, and beans on a plate or bowl. Top with avocado and egg. Sprinkle with lemon juice and parsley. Drizzle with olive oil, if desired. Sprinkle with pepper and kosher or sea salt. Sit and savor.",3

You are beyond words beautiful, i had to look at your other photos out of curiosity and you look just as good in one as you do the last. I wish you had the mother daughter relationship that you described/deserve. I hope that someday maybe if you make the decision in the future you could have that with your own daughter possibly.

3888,weu7zn,Any-Calligrapher8723,"You are beautiful! 

My grandma was my best friend. I lost her 20 years ago. This last year I was going through a lot and I really missed her. I follow this woman on Instagram who lost her child. She talked about signs from folks who have transitioned. I read up on it. There are lists of ways folks communicate to you. 
 
I asked my grandma to send me white feathers. I’m not kidding you I find them all the time. One time there was one stuck to my car window. I have seen them in my house. There has been one on my car seat before I even opened the door. I had something happen that made me so nervous about a big decision I had made. I was pacing around my back patio. I looked down and there was a perfectly dry white feather on a my wet pavers. 

Now I know it’s my grams. Too many coincidences. 

Maybe ask your mom to give you a sign. Then you can feel her with you on all those mother/daughter moments. Even tho white feathers don’t always appear all over. It makes me feel close to my grandma when they do. 

Sending you so much love!",1

 I know she passed wondering why I was always so depressed with a hatred for life. But hoping she can see me now, happy and thriving.",4
3927,weu7zn,Physicsdummy,"So it takes a bit of work, I primarily use DevaCurl products.

Lowpoo Delight and it’s matching conditioner when washing hair and I’m talking like really condition, so run it through out your hair very slowly, deliberately and make sure to squish it all together so it really absorbs into your strands.

I let it sit for five minutes plus and at that point I start using a detangling brush to break up the strands softly with causing major hurtful breakage to my hair.

Finally right as you finish showering and your hair is sopping wet, I use DevaCurl’s Ultra defining gel, again making sure to really run it through all strands and then squenching it further. I then part my hair and either let it air dry (A five or so hour process with my dense hair) or if I’m in a hurry I diffuse it on the lowest heat and fan setting.

The thing with curl definer is that it’ll form a cast when you eventually have to break by squishing after it’s fully locked your hair shape in.

That’s why I tend to plan my wash days after work before dinner and bed. By the time my cast is ready to be broken, I actually put my hair in a silk bonnet (which I do every night regardless of wash day or not) this helps because as I sleep and toss and turn through the night it naturally breaks the cast that way.

Then in the mornings, I wake up remove my cap shake out my hair and then style it and kinda floof it with my hands applying some Argan oil on my hands when I do so.

I have extremely curly hair so I never brush it as it would destroy the curls.

Kinda a lot but my curly girl journey has been illuminating and it’s one of my favorite features about myself. 💜",3

I go back and forth between cutting it really short and growing it out but leaving it in a ponytail 95% of the time since it’s so thick and it gets so big when it’s humid. I might have to spring for the Devacurl stuff finally. I’ve got their crazy looking diffuser but I haven’t tried their actual products yet. 

How much of the defining gel do you use? I’ve got another brand of gel for curly hair and I’ve tried to do the scrunch it out with a cast thing but I haven’t quite figured out how gelled up my hair should be to start with.

I need a new silk cap, too. Someone gave me one as a gift but it doesn’t stay on my head at night. Maybe I’m too aggressive of a sleeper, haha.",3

I separate my hair into three symmetrical parts down the middle and then do three pumps of gel, shake hands together and apply one hand to each side if that makes sense.

I've only done a little welding recreationally and with lots of supervision, but it was enough to make me appreciate that it's a real craft that requires skill, talent and patience. It pays off when you finish a project and you realize ""I made that! It didn't exist before, and now it does."" That's an awesome feeling, and I hope you get to feel it over and over again as you learn and practice your craft. I'm proud of your accomplishment and eager to see where it takes you!",297

Now, take your safety seriously. Never EVER use eye protection that has even the smallest scratch on it. If you live where it gets cold a Carhart jumper will help keep most of your body warm while allowing your arms to move if you have to work in the cold.

Welding is a great career.",133

4611,utb4u0,sloasdaylight,"The reason to not wear eye protection that has scratches in it is because your employer is supposed to provide you with good eye pro.

If you have Z87 eye protection that *does not* have an actual hole in it, you'll be fine. The reason people get arc flash is because their irises get exposed to way more UV radiation than they should normally. In essence, your eyes get sun burnt. As long as you make sure your eyes are protected from UV radiation (which Z87 eye pro. does), you'll be fine. You shouldn't be welding without a hood anyways.

Make that two because I like hoodies and love Mr. Pandakins and Wally Wallabun-bun.
I also want to hang out with the artist because the person who can create such joyful whimsy is somebody whose perspective and take on the world is something I want to experience, learn from, and try to embrace myself.
.

Also. I paint and I'm told I'm not too bad and have even sold a few paintings... but watercolours terrify me. Mine always get muddy and messy and I can't get what I want ever. They're delicate and you need both a lot of control/patience and the ability to just let go and let things fall where they are and I just can't do it. All that to say... you just picked up some watercolours and came back with several beautiful, emotion-drawing, pheromone inducing, take-all-my-money inspiring love. That's a massive accomplishment!
My mother always told me that my artwork was a useless hobby and I was no good at it. She even threw away a few of my pieces and my cousin salvaged them from a dumpster, framed them, and hung them in her house and is ecstatic to have ""original"" artwork. So I know how deeply painful it is to have your pride of accomplishment torn down by the person who should be your biggest cheerleader. I'm your mom now and I want to be your first customer. And I'll share your incredible work with the glow of pride and say, ""look what my kid created! Aren't they amazing?"" Because you are.

Well done you. I do believe everyone has creativity, but your art clearly displays talent — and most of all, skill. Idk if you’ve had any training (I’m self-taught, but BOY have I learned the value of the “taught” part over time!)

Your composition is very good; that’s difficult to teach, and good that you have a natural ability. Your brushwork is also v good, and what you, me and the other watercolorist know (that many don’t) is that watercolor, while popular, is probably the most DIFFICULT medium to paint in. 

(Ever wonder why all the masters worked in OIL, despite how much it cost? Yep, it’s EASIER. Like electric guitars are easier to play than acoustic. Oh, snap, I’m letting ALL the secrets out, lol)

Allow me to introduce you to Scott Christian Sava, whose YouTube channel will bring joy to your heart. He is on a mission to make art fun — and possible — to everyone, and his lessons are free.

5048,sh96f4,Monthly_Vent,"As a use to be teen girl, and definitely still sheltered to this day, I once was at a party that constantly ignored my existence, which lead to a bit of anxiety. So to cope, I went out for a walk. Mind you this was after 8PM, when the night was pitch black, and I vividly remember during the walk I saw a sign that said there was high crime and to beware. Kept walking around the block for 30 minutes before coming back to the party.

When I came back my dad told me I wasn’t allowed to do that alone because I could endanger myself. I was extremely confused and frustrated as to why I wasn’t allowed to do the one thing that can calm myself down (walking with one of my parents just makes the anxiety worse) despite the fact I knew exactly what kind of danger he was talking about. I held onto that frustration for years until I was about 16 and a half when I realize “oh fuck I’m not strong enough to save myself if something horrible were to happen”

I think because I’ve never seen it happen to me or anyone I knew around me I convinced myself I was immune to that specific danger, even though I consciously knew it wasn’t true.  I kind of wish someone were to tell me “look you haven’t learned all the signs to notice when assault is coming and you don’t know how to protect yourself when you do see those signs. You can’t go outside *alone* at night unless you learn exactly how to spot danger and how to defend yourself from danger”. That way I would technically be allowed to take night walks (not threatening my teenage want for trust and independence) but at the same time I still need to work on earning that trust and independence which, hopefully makes me realize that most people don’t have much of a defense against this kind of stuff",19

5054,sh96f4,wikipedia_answer_bot,"**Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced interactions with surroundings. It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness, with sleep displaying different, active brain patterns.**

5058,sh96f4,osirisrebel,"Exactly, even as a man, there's been times strangers have given me a ride and other men have tried groping me, and I'm not even pretty. 

If possible, always use the buddy system, even if it's just a phone call. Go with your gut, if it seems off, it probably is, even if it isn't, don't risk it.

No matter how many videos you've seen, a kick in the balls isn't going to stop someone who's desperate. If at all possible, tax time is coming, take a few months in an MMA gym or something similar and let them know why and what you wanna protect yourself against. 

Even if you're complete dog shit at learning to fight, you now have some people you can call on if things go sideways. 

If possible, get your CCW permit, some states don't even require the permit, and carry a gun, there's a huge market for cute concealed carry purses, and same with the MMA gym, gun ranges are a great place to get contacts, and there's plenty of men and women in both places. 

Either place will give great tips on keeping yourself alive. Odds are, you'll be fine and never need to use any of these things, but I'm more of a ""have it and not need it"" type of person.",8

So I end up awake for 26 hours before I crash hard. And no diagnosis unfortunately, my sleep study came back perfectly normal.",2
5063,sh96f4,Sunnygurrl,You're welcome dear.,2
5064,sh96f4,Monthly_Vent,"Agree with this 100%. It took a while but I found out a lot of physical self defense tips and techniques on the internet are utter bullshit unless either the attacker is extremely weak or you are extremely jacked yourself. Of course try them if you think it can help you be safer, but it’s probably best to take a class in a gym than to self-teach at home. 

I once heard from an interview with a thief that calls from loved ones scare them because that tells them that the person on the other end can and will call the police if anything bad were to happen. I know it’s not the same but I think a call with someone can act similar. If you’re on a call, I’d recommend constantly stating your location to them so if anything happens they know exactly where to call the police to. I’m not sure if this is a good mindset to have, but I sometimes think to myself if I get raped or murdered someone better know about it and rope law enforcement into it. 

Also the thing about getting contacts from an MMA gym or a gun range is smart, cause I can’t imagine how intimidating it must be to hear “Hey just making sure, but do we have mixed martial arts training/gun shooting training today? Oh, well can we be on call still? I’m at [insert location here] and I’m pretty much alone by myself and bored so I’m wondering if you can stay on call until I get home? Haha thanks, see this is why you befriend the best martial artist/shooter in your training sessions.” (Even if they aren’t the best)

Also thanks for the idea of getting a CCW. I was originally going to just have pepper spray and a pocket knife, but it might be better to have a carry as well just in case, especially since I’m a petite Asian women who can’t build muscle if my life depended on it, so I know I’m literally a walking target for sexual assault. I’m glad I never had to encounter anything but that might be due to me being sheltered and not going out much unless I’m with someone. The more I can defend myself the better",6
5065,sh96f4,hyperfat,"Someone told me seraquil is good. It's a antidepressant anti psychotic. This person sleeps well. 


I feel you, I sleep 5 hours maybe normally. Ambien I slept 4 hours and woke up so awake it was like coke or something. 


Exercise? Run until I was tired (1.5 hours). 5 hours sleep.",1
5066,sh96f4,osirisrebel,"Yeah, if you do go for pepper spray, get pepper gel instead, pepper spray can become friendly fire in a windy area, you'll attack them and yourself. Knives imply they're already up close and personal and within range to grab you.

If you have people you can really trust, there are location sharing apps and/or GPS locations tags that you can basically just have on your key ring. 

Hell if you have the money and a roommate, a GPS hunting dog collar would be great just to have in your purse. They can work a few miles in range and give exact location. 

As far as the MMA/gun range, it even more than physical, another thing is freezing and panicking in a situation, so it can help with a different mindset/ confidence. Also teaches you what to look out for.

But if you want a crash course based on a few words, then here:

Target the eyes, esophagus, a good knee or punch to the sternum, these should buy you a few seconds, but nothing is better than getting actually experience/ contacts/ a weapon that  will protect you at a distance.",5
5067,sh96f4,feralturtleduck,"if you’re grabbed, fingers are also good to target. fighting against a person’s entire grip strength is difficult, *especially* if they’re bigger than you. it’s easier to get your hand around one finger and snap it",2
5068,sh96f4,osirisrebel,"Yeah, if you can grab any of the fingers, wrap your first 3 fingers around the bottom 2/3 of the attackers finger (your grip should end at the bottom of the 2nd bendy knuckle) grip hard and use your thumb to push the fingers tip to the side. 

With a good enough push, it'll break, but just a little pressure this way is still quite painful.

The only thing is not to depend on one thing as a stand alone technique, the more you can have in your bag of tricks, the better your chances.",2

I honestly want to give you a big old hug, look you deep in the eyes, and tell you that you are worthy of all the beauty and love life has to offer. If you ever get to a dark place again, do me a favor. Get a picture of yourself when you were little, one of those pics where you were adorable with a big cheesy grin that shows unabashed joy. Put that picture on the corner of your bathroom mirror. Anytime you start with self-critical thoughts (I'm worthless, I don't deserve happiness, or any of the dark things an addict says to themselves when they are feeling down) look at that picture. Would you say those things to that little happy kid? You are still that little kid inside, and what you say to yourself, good or bad, you are saying to him. Talk that little kid up good! Tell that little kid what he's REALLY worth- priceless.",13

5433,v7bcp1,Amorette93,"*i remember this feeling*. There's nothing like opening that first box of things you were able to afford for your place. I remember crying when I opened up my new set of stainless steel pots (tip: do not ever purchase aluminum or non-stick pans. They wear out and will need to be replaced within 5-10 years. This means you will spend considerably more money replacing them than if you would have if you got cast iron or stainless. For stainless to be non-stick, you must heat it up to ripping heat and then pour oil on it. This will close the pores of the pan and make it less sticky. You can often find stainless and cast iron that need just a little bit of love in thrift stores. Please feel free to private message me for more details on how to restore older cookware if needed. It should be noted that if you have a hard time affording dark vegetables and leafy greens that you should do your best to obtain a cast iron to cook as much as you can in as it greatly increases the serum levels of iron in your body which is incredibly important for menstruating woman if you are menstruating). Then came the curtains, a cover for an old ratty couch, and the towels. Oh, the towels!!  New and soft 🥹 

Reminder to everyone: universal basic income fixes this problem so that no one ever has to cry over a box of basic necessities for survival. The only way for universal income to enter the United States is with the active pressure of as many citizens as possible. Please consider contacting politicians or signing petitions about universal income, And VOTE locally.",278

Buying my own cheap food, setting up a thrift store lamp with a handmade shade of parchment paper, finally getting my cat back from his temporary home and going to sleep that first night with him purring on my bed... And locking my front door and knowing I was safe. No one could get me. No one would yell at me. It was magical. I'm so happy for you and I do understand. All of these things, small and simple, they are YOURS. You can use them however you like, and no one will be there to judge, criticize, punish, or take them from you. Of course that's thrilling. Of course that's amazing. Revel in it to your heart's content.

and thank you for sharing all of that!

I've gotten so used to getting by, i forgot what it's like to not think like that

thank you for caring and speaking up. I've been advocating for universal income and healthcare too. necessities and essentials shouldn't be luxuries. many countries already have universal income and nearly eradicated homelessness through it, especially after the pandemic hit

What a sweet message, and it's true- I love everyday waking up feeling so excited and grateful for the little things I once took for granted. Laundry day is my favorite day. Sometime I just watch the washer turning lol or stare at the clean floors and countertop. I can't explain it, it just makes me so happy and peaceful. Thank you for celebrating with me! I love this subreddit, I know i always find love and kindness here like I've always looked for  


That would be so sweet and I would absolutely love that thank you! Thank you for bing a part of my journey and helping on the way.

5609,v7bcp1,Amorette93,"Every time!! Unlike cast iron which ""seasons"" by oils undergoing a polymerase chain reaction that creates an anti-stick coating at high heat, Stainless doesn't do this. It shouldn't because the pores contract and expand at different temps, which would result in an uneven cooking surface.

Bonus info: 

 The **most** nonstick pan is a well seasoned cast iron pan. To season a new (it will say preseasoned if it's brand new. Ignore it.) Pan, preheat your oven to 350. Get crisco (though many cast iron enthusiasts choose different oils, this is a good high temp beginner, cheap oil) and a paper towel and spread a *thin* layer of crisco,then buff well with the towel until the oil looks smooth and shiny. Pop into oven (it's fine if it's not totally preheated) and let bake for an hour. Turn off oven and let pan cool inside. Repeat this process three times. This pan will now have eggs glide around. You also need to preheat, but tbh you should be preheating anything that isn't Teflon non-stick. We think we shouldn't cuz of Teflon lol. Teflon makes poison when you do that 🤮. Do not wash cash iron with soap, unless you want to go through that seasoning process again. Use hot water, a Scrub Daddy/Scrub Sponge and baking soda or salt to buff out food. Place wet pan on stove and turn on until it's dry or dry well with paper towels. Spread a thin layer of crisco for protection and itd clean and ready to store and use. That last layer of Crisco events any areas that may have missed polymerizing from resting in which case you wouldn't need to refinish the entire cast iron 😮‍💨 if you use your cast iron frequently with oil, you will not need to reseason it ever but if you don't use it frequently you might want to re-season it if it gets less non stick. You can use any and all tools including metal with them. 

To reseason and restore cast iron found at garage sales, estate sales, rummage sales, and thrift stores, message me.",28

And the first time you get to tell some other young woman the same thing, and get to slip her some money and tell her she’ll be ok, you’ll cry and go and open the box again.

To never worry again and really know that everything is better than okay now and I can take it all in without fear of losing it. I feel that more and more lately but there's still a part of me that wonders sometimes if it's too good to be true. But i know it's not. I'm living it and the past is in the past.   


I think I'm gonna make a point to have a little box like this. Because I want to have that experience often.   


 I'm honestly so happy for you reading this though. I'm so happy you know what that feels like and get to experience it often. I'm so happy that my post about dancing around in front of my first mirror will bring you back to your little box and remind you how far you've come and how proud of you should be of everything you went through to have a better life. You deserve to celebrate yourself too every time you open your little box and see another young woman on this path.

I'm so happy that my little post reflected in so many people and brought them some joy and excitement to live too. This was one of the most surprising but loving and supportive experiences I've had.   
I took a screenshot of your message and saved it as my desktop background. This is why I keep going and keep staying grateful and positive. There's so much more to life than all the pain. And it's such privilege to celebrate it with wonderful people like you and everyone else who commented on here. I never thought it would get so much support, but it just added to my happiness. I never actually thought I could be this happy. At least before I escaped. It's incredible to be here now, and be overjoyed by the little things and all the love I've gotten. These message do heal some trauma, at least the fear that I'd never know what a mom's love would feel like. I'm so glad I do now.

5638,vao43v,SandwichMiddle4059,"I made it one whole year today and I'm over the moon proud of myself. 

 I would like to share my story a little bit though. 
My drug journey started on a trip around Halloween to my long distance (now ex) girlfriends place. She had picked me up and we had a 7 hour drive back to her place. On the drive she asked me if I'd like to do some drugs this week. Now I'd never done anything more than smoke weed by this point but I was curious so I said ""sure!"" We end up doing some pressed psilocybin, that she called ""silly caps"". These made her trip much like one would expect, but I got nothing other than super sad on them, and didn't really enjoy the experience.  

After that a few months later she was in my hometown to visit and on that week she had brought more silly caps and a couple of presses of Molly. The silly caps gave the same reaction as last time and I didn't enjoy it, but the Molly had me feeling better than I ever had before and I loved that feeling. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I found a local connect for lsd and ""Molly"" (quotes here are important and I'll explain in a bit). After that I spent probably 6-8 months just fucked at every opportunity that I had. The days not eating acid were spent swallowing ""Molly"", and staying up waaay to late alone in my room. 

Until one day I decided to stop swallowing the ""Molly"" and snorting it bc it worked faster and felt better. I did this for maybe a month or two idk the exact time, those days are really blurry in my memory. 

Eventually I was like I should but a test kit and be a little safer with my consumption. I had already finished 1g of ""Molly"" and had bought another gram. I test it and it's methamphetamine, and probably had been the entire time I had been doing ""Molly"" locally. I got scared and I knew how addictive meth could be, but by that point it was too late, I was hooked and couldn't stop. 

I binged for three days, till my body ran out of dopamine and each subsequent hit wasn't doing anything for me. No sleep barely any food, and no clue how I got through a day of work in the middle of it. 

But I ended up at this girl's house that I had been talking to for a while, I confessed what was going on and how powerless I felt to stop and I asked her to flush the rest of the crystal I had. We went to bed together that night, and she helped me get to work the next day and through the withdrawals and recovery from partying over the coming weeks. She loved me at my lowest and for that I'm always going to be grateful. 

In the subsequent year after that night, I haven't had anything harder than weed at all. And have turned down the opportunity on two occasions to do anything stronger, one was an old dealer hitting me up saying he had LSD and ""Molly"" and an acquaintance offering me a Xanax. So I feel like if I could be strong in those moments I can continue to be strong as time goes by. 

Good luck to everyone else doing the sober thing, I believe in all of us, and thanks for reading and letting me get this off my chest.",239

When I was about 22 I was at my mother's ex-husbands house (he was my father growing up) drinking alone in the spare bedroom.

My best friend who I hadn't seen or heard from in a few months (this was normal) showed up and confessed to me that she had been shooting Roxicets.

Next thing I know(after an hour of talking) she is sticking me with a needle (consented to).

I continued doing this for about 6 months and then at the end of that time frame I lost 4 friends in 2 days to fentynal overdoses.

I went cold turkey for about 6 months and then relapsed. Went cold turkey again for another few months and then relapsed again. I went about 2 years clean and then got addicted to popping Roxicets for a few months.

I've now been clean going on 8 years.",3

I’m glad you took the step to test those drugs because sadly sometimes they get contaminated or mixed with other crap. My sweet younger cousin died of a meth OD a month ago along with heart damage from prolonged stimulant use. We were besties and talked daily, went to school together, all that jazz. The call from my mom destroyed me and I had to book it back home ASAP. Most people had no idea because it’s an easy one to hide and I do not want to see someone else succumb to this drug, it eats at your soul and takes everything from you.

I also want you to know that it’s OK if you slip up, shit happens and I won’t judge you for it. ❤️ But please reach out to someone close to you if you need help. You’re loved more than you know.

5726,vao43v,alpinedaddy1623,"The acid and shrooms (shrooms more than acid) arent the issue but I definitely understand just wanting to stay away from all hard drugs, ive never done meth but I wanted to for a really long time, I do acid and shrooms and they help me more than make things worst for me imo but they still can be abused and overdone, more than 1-2 times a month max and even then its pushing it, also good on you for not doing xanax, its really addictive and hard to stop and I was and am still into it. Alot of drugs arent what they say they are, alot of xanax and meth are cut with fentanyl which can easily kill you, acid you only have to worry about Nbomes because that is lethal if you take too much wheras acid is completely safe (physically). Most molly isnt molly isnt molly at all, which this site  has alot of test of street drugs and you can see that over the past few years there is about a 25 percent chance what you get is real, few years ago it was 50 and before that it was like 12, it depends on whose selling and manufacturing it and how long it takes for them to be caught and seized which when that does happen people start to make fake pills to trick people like you who dont know what to look for and just get that euphoric rush that everyone was talking about so they assumed it was molly, molly is also an amphetamine in its own sense to there are probably many people like you who had no idea what to expect or that you could even test it at home and confirm what it is, I believe certain drugs have their purpose and can be great tools when used properly but when abused it becomes an issue. Meth was used in ww2 for soldiers to get energy and stay awake and if it did that safely without the long term effects or addiction then it would probably still be used today, psychedelics are legal/decriminalized in many places in the world and is starting to become decriminalized here, Molly has been used in psychotherapy and has been seen to help cure depression (when its actually pure 100% molly), ketamine (horse tranquilizer) has been shown to help people who suffer with depression and ptsd (again when its ketamine and not cut with meth). As someone who suffers from addiction themselves I wish you the best and hope you keep on with your hard work, it can be extremely difficult especially when you let your world start falling down.",-8

I understand what drug addictions like and am the youngest of 3 older drug addicts and a drug addict dad, all are sober now (as far as I know) but it still shows through and I still have lots of trust issues cuz of it and dont really like my family (mom either cuz she pretended like it didnt happen and about how I dont have any clue the type of stuff she had to go through and im just overreacting.

Id like to be able to be sober and achieve the same things that he did but some days I honestly dont know if I could live without them, ive come to rely on weed, alcohol and xanax and dont know what id do without them, Shrooms and acid are the only 2 that I can genuinely say I have no shame in doing becuase they literally saved my life (at least I feel like they did), something changed the day I did them and I became happier, more optimistic, looked at things from another perspective (and yet still get to extremely depressive states). Obviously im not going to have the same views as him an was just trying to inform him how drugs can be used for genuinely good purposes but they also do cross a line eventually and many people have a hard time knowing where that line is.

5740,vao43v,tuliprox,"Absolutely, same for me as well. I tried 3 different therapists (one was cool, but ive since moved away) and several different antidepressant meds for my depression/anxiety/likely undiagnosed ADHD, and truly and honestly, shrooms have helped me so much more.

Obviously everyone is different and has different reactions to different chemicals, but shrooms have definitely helped my mental health immensely, as it has you, and many others as well.

Ive had a couple therapeutic LSD trips, but I have had some bad trips on LSD and i always feel ""hungover"" in a way the next day. With shrooms, i feel SO much love and emotion in general, and even though I have had a few ""bad"" trips on shrooms, none of them were close to how bad my bad LSD trips were, and I truly feel as though ive learned things from my ""bad"" shroom trips as well.

Sorry, i could talk about shrooms/fungi forever lol. They really helped me change my life and helped me to start retraining/rewiring my brain into healthier thoughts/behaviors and i will be forever grateful.",1
5741,vao43v,alpinedaddy1623,"I would say the ""bad trips"" I had were all shroom trips but all my bad trips I've learned from the most so to me they were actually good. Acid is more of a party drug imo and is alot more physical than emotional, I like acid with others and shrooms by myself. I wish I could find a meaning for why they do what they do like so many other people can but I just know they've helped me and kinda made me happier.",2
5742,vao43v,tuliprox,"Yeah i agree about acid being more of a party drug and being more physical. I just hate the vasoconstriction i get from acid. I don't start feeling it til the the beginning-middle of the comedown tho. And then the next day my body is sore af.

With shrooms i feel so refreshed the next day i love it haha. Ive been on a break from acid for a few years; was doing it a bit too often (like once every 2-3 weeks for a month or so, and then like once a month/every other month or so for like 6 mos) which may have played a factor in my bad trips on it. 

I think a lot of it for me is also i think i really dont like how the comedown feels on acid toward the end of the trip, and i think i get freaked out by my dreams/nightmares starting when i try to finally go to sleep at the end, and/or i hate the feeling of being Soooo sleepy but not being able to sleep cause acid. Cause any time that ive started drinking alcohol or took a quarter bar of xanax near the end of my acid trip when i start feeling all... Bad trippy lol idk how to explain it like just severe anxiety and really negative intrusive thoughts and shit, both the alcohol and xanax (separate occasions) helped IMMENSELY. Not encouraging anyone to do this, ive just found that it helps me in that situation.

But i also prefer to go out and do things and socialize with people on acid, while on shrooms i prefer to only be with my husband. If we had a close friend that was kindhearted and we enjoyed spending time with and trusted and who liked tripping too, then I would also enjoy shroom tripping with my husband and our described nonexistent friend sometimes as well tho.

I have definitely found meaning in shrooms/fungi. Acid, like I agreed, feels like more of a party drug tho.",2
5743,vao43v,alpinedaddy1623,"Xanax has helped me but I like it too much, it helps my anxiety and allows me to talk to people (especially women) and open up much more, alcohol does the same thing but it impairs me more, I have and do combine them just try to keep it at a minimum cuz it is dangerous. I've tripped with some close friends and some of them were awesome and we connected and opened up and others they kinda showed their true colors (one was an emotionally and semi physically abusive (intimidation tactics) to my best friend who is still with him. Ik why she's with him which is why i try to be supportive of her but its hard sometimes, especially with how trauma bonded she is and how much she tells herself everything's ok, but thats a whole other story.",2

I guess I'm lucky my parents aren't like yours but if it happened to me and I won a million dollars after taxes, I'd probably sit them down, tell them I'd pay the invoice but in exchange, cut all ties with them because they treated me like they raised me while expecting to get paid for it someday. That's not love and parents are expected to provide for their children, it's a societal norm that establishes an investment into the future. Of course, they might have done this because money is really tight for them but they essentially sold their relationship with you in exchange for their own comfort.

It’s a very difficult situation, OP, and I am sorry you have to go through this. And by “difficult situation”, I mean in terms of navigating the relationship moving forward now that this has happened. What isn’t difficult is knowing you should not pay them a single penny, even though it sounds like you originally were going to share some. Trust me, it will never end if you give them anything. You will forever become a human ATM and the resentment you feel will only get worse. 

For something like this, my advice would be to make sure you are firm and non-emotional in your response, making clear you’re not paying them and it is not something up for further discussion. Cutting it off at the pass will likely lead them to blow up, probably stop speaking to you for at least a little while, and perhaps even cause them to paint you out to be some sort of monster to other friends and family members. All of that is still preferable to paying them anything and forever feeling indebted. (Besides, the second they tell anyone they tried to invoice you for your childhood and you wouldn’t pay, it’s them that will be the obvious monster and not you.) Internet hugs to you!",6
5785,t71chq,demimondatron,"Just in case you weren’t aware, this is called financial abuse. 

Children don’t owe their parents for being raised. You didn’t choose to be born; they chose to be parents. You didn’t force the responsibility on them. They made the choice and *they are responsible for the consequences of their choices.* They’re adults and they should start acting like it. 

You are not obligated to pay this, legally or emotionally. If she didn’t have a pre-existing agreement with you that any of these things would be given to you on the grounds you repay her, then she has no legal standing. No sane lawyer would represent her, and any sane judge would laugh her out of the courtroom, if not denounce her audacity. 

Remember: you are allowed to be your own person and live your own life. Good parents don’t birth children for obligation.

5790,t71chq,sardonicoperasinger,"When I clicked this, I seriously thought your mom was playing a prank on you -- it was unthinkable to me that your parents would invoice you like this! When I realized it was real, and saw all the comments that are rightfully angry about her request, I agreed with them. I still do.

But... I had another thought when I saw the note about retirement. I'm in my late 20s, and personally I worry a lot about my parents in the future if/when they retire, because due to some setbacks and their unique situation (trying not to go into too many personal details!), I'm not sure they have saved enough, even though they've worked all their lives, and are still working.

They'd never ask me for money, however, out of fear of limiting my ability to develop my own career/life *in any way.* But to me, this is part of the issue. They were thrifty so that they could give me all the opportunities I've had -- much more than they did growing up --  and at times paid for me when they could have saved (i.e. at university, they paid more so I could do less workstudy and focus on schoolwork; later I realized that my peers whose parents earned much more did not, and felt guilty about it). So I actually wish they would be open with me about their finances and the gap between what they have and what they need to live comfortably when they do retire. If it turned out that they needed a lot more help than I can help with, it's still possible for me to change careers (love my job now but know I can earn more doing smth I like less), but I'm pretty sure it's bc they're worried I'll do that that they don't tell me. Although it's so touching that they always want to maximize rather than limit my freedom to choose how I live my life in the way I find happiest, I simply wouldn't be happy seeing them short on money in retirement or unable to retire and not being able to help. So thinking in terms of my family, if it were really an issue of retirement budgeting, and I could afford it, I'd help out in a heartbeat.

You say you are 28, and this invoice covers the last seven years, so from you being 21 up to now. So we're not quite talking ""costs of bringing up a minor"" here but ""costs of a young adult living at home"".

Don't get me wrong - I have kids of my own, some of them being adults, too, and while I would never write them such a ridiculous invoice - I do expect them to contribute financially to our household, like rent and food, BUT only because they have a financial income.

And we had a talk that was clearly labeled as such, ""Talk about contributing financially"", and I give them a roundup of our costs each month. In a way we are more like room mates sharing a flat - with the special perk that I cook and do more of the chores. 

I do this because I want to prepare them for the moment they make enough money to move out. To be used to the need to pay money for rent, to budget, to have a look into the monthly costs of living. 

So, to make this short: I \*\*could\*\* understand your parents wanting to contribute financially to the costs of living, but to just spring this ridiculous invoice at you... is pitiful, at the least. I don't know if you ever negotiated about you contributing, if you had some sort of income or not, if these amounts were something out of the ordinary. But I'd say:

If there was no earlier negotiation about you paying them back for anything on this list, this is ridiculous and shameful and you should NOT pay them. Cause, as already said, it will open the flood gates.

It is good on you that you wanted to gift them some part of the money anyway. Maybe you still feel like it, maybe you want to re-label that money as ""reimbursement"" for their general generosity.

5867,t71chq,Patt_McKrotch,"I learned someone from this aweful man. He would make promises to his employees (raises or bonuses for unmoral and unethical deeds) and they would do it. They would come asking for payment and he would reply,

""Did you get it in writing?""

See, he would promise verbally, which in the state we lived in did not constitute a legal agreement. He could promise anything, but he never signed any paper or made offers in writing, so it wasn't legally binding. They couldn't take him to court because there's no legal contact (plus because of the content of the request, they'd likely be fined or jailed, but that's beside the point).

This man likely falls into the clinical diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, so I hate that I learned this valuable legal and business trick from him. In the world of money, if you want a promise kept (payment for a loan, services, or product) you must sign a contract before the exchange of goods.

I'm betting your mom didn't have you sign a contract 2003 (when the invoice began), 2014 (when the interest began), or now upon request of repayment. Perhaps she typed up an agreement for just the loan, but I didn't see that mentioned anywhere. Even if she did, a minor cannot legally sign this kind of contact. The parent cannot approve the signature of such document if they're the other party and I doubt she got you a legal representative and did it in front of a notary.

She wants to play hardball? Put on you pads and hit back. ""I see you are interested in payment, may I see the contract where I legally agreed to pay this back?"" 

Seeing as this is family, it could be difficult to get over emotions but this document isn't being considerate of yours, so just a view point to consider. Playing hardball with anyone is tough but it's harder with your parents. You may want to try other routes but keep this logic in your pack pocket if things escalate.



Note: I'm not a lawyer, in the justice field, or in the financial field at all. This is simply stuff I've learned through life experiences and is not adequate legal/financial advice, just an relatable life lesson I've learned.

My parents were good to me and they’re long gone now, but I still have some regrets. I wouldn’t want them to dominate my life, I just want them to make me a better parent and grandparent.  Take the long view!  A psych** professional can really do that.

I tried to work, go to collage, etc.; and had issues with health where I couldn't last. My parents helped me financially often for that reason. I ended up married with my daughters on the way, and I got disability due to my disease and inability to work. My mother wanted me to pay her back for things she paid for to help me as I struggled to be on my own. It was my father that stepped in and stopped her. My father told her it was their duty to help me in need. I had a family now to think of and care for. And I should use my pack pay for my family, not to pay them back anything. I also want to add my father was making 100K- 80K roughly a year, and my mother was making 25k- 60K in the time frame of my help. Dad was working upper management in a company over transportation section till the business side collapsed and then he went to help run a smaller transportation company. Mother was college educated and went from a private sector rehab counselor job, to drug prevention with a government agency. And she wanted me to pay back rent for 3-4 months, and help with other bills in that time period. Along with ""other"" things....

&#x200B;

I suggest to you two things. One, if your parents are in need of help, do so. But not in the amount ""mother"" is asking. Second, talk with both parents. Father might not know nothing. And if so, he could be very mad over this. Also I would suggest saying you have no issue helping out, but when it comes to paying things back for raising you as ""mother"" is demanding is out of the question. And as such is also extremally hurtful to think your parents want money back for being your parents. But also state you have no issue with helping out since you want to if needed, but not because it is being demanded or required.",1
6035,t71chq,AdDry725,"OP— here is an idea for a sassy reply (if you feel like being sassy).  Reply with a bill for charging them for care for when they are elderly. 

If they view taking care of a dependent family member as a financial loan—then let them have it.  Let them know you won’t take care of them, unless they pay you. 

(Except if you do that, that is fair. What they did to you is a million times worse.  You were a CHILD.  Parents are supposed to pay the expenses to take care of their children. That’s the law.  It’s also the only morally correct thing to do.  You didn’t sign up for these expenses— they did.  If they didn’t want these expenses, they shouldn’t have had a kid.)

Taking care of these horrible excuses for “parents” in their old age is being too merciful.  Clearly these monsters don’t view a family relationship as family, they view it as business.  (Worse: non-consensual business they’re enforcing on a child that they brought into the world. The kid never signed up for these expenses.)

If these people view “taking care of a dependent family member person” as a business transaction—then business transactions they shall indeed have.

I would charge them if they ask me to take care of them in their elderly years.

You charged me rent, food, utilities, care, etc, for when I was a child and unable to work, you expect to get paid for taking care of me when I was able to work.  Fair is fair.  I expect to get paid for taking care of you, when you are unable to work.

Except you requesting to charge them money to take care of family is 100x nicer and more legal, because at least it is legal to give loans and financial contracts to adults.

You cannot do that to a child.  Especially without consent.  It’s like kidnapping someone, holding them hostage for 18 years, and then expecting them to pay all the expenses acquired during that time frame they were there against their will.  Like, ummmm, I didn’t ask to be here.",1

Anyway. 

You deserved to have parents who love you unconditionally. Love is not just a contract. Parents are not supposed to get something back at the end of the day. As a mom you give and you give and the only thing you ask for in return is love. Not money. The only parents who ever expect things back from their child are abusing and selfish. 

It sounds like your wife and her parents are wonderful people. I hope you can meet up with them soon and share with them how all of this is making you feel. I really really hope they can, with time, become like parents to you. Because I know in my soul you deserve better. 

Speak to a lawyer with your wife present. An initial consultation should not be too expensive. Having some professional advice will also help you feel a bit more solid about this. You are not going to pay one cent of that. You don't owe them anything. If they are going to treat you like a cash cow they don't even deserve your attention. 

It's sad, because if they hadn't done this, maybe you would have bought them nice gifts at Christmas time. Maybe you could have bought a holiday for them in return. Now they will get nothing. Their greed and disrespect for you is palpable. 

Hope you are getting lots of hugs at the moment. Make sure to hold them for 15 seconds for your body to register it properly. It's okay to cry about this, because you've been betrayed. It's okay to laugh about this, because it's ridiculous. It's okay to be angry about this, because they don't have the right. It's okay to be embarrassed about this, it's a little humiliating.

There is a silver lining here to consider:  she just defined your relationship as a transaction.  It’s no different from when you go to a store and pay for a good or service.  When you receive a faulty product or a bad service, you are well within your rights to refuse payment.  It’s also helpful to remember that we do not generally invite the salespeople, checkout attendants Or waitstaff (or anyone else involved in some commercial transaction) into our homes, into our personal lives, into our holidays, etc. and we don’t really think twice about it (or even feel guilty about it for that matter).

As sad as it it…and it truly is…this is a gift.  She clearly defined the relationship for you.  Please believe her when she tells you that she’s nothing more than the person on the other side of a financial transaction.  And then refuse payment for awful service.

Tell her if you have to pay her this now, you’ll have no option but to put them in a “Home” later (retirement home, old people facility where you abandon your parents).

Regardless of any truth to this, it might make her shut the fuck up a little bit. The standard rules for paying back your parents are as follows: you change my diapers, I change yours; unless you suck. From this point on, you have the upper hand. Don’t let your parents forget that.

No one, no matter how much money the kid ends up having, and how poor the parents end up being, no kid **owes** their parents a single penny for raising them. If a parent and child has a good relationship, and the kid comes into a large sum of money, a reasonable person would assume that the kid would *gift* them some money, but it certainly wouldn't be *owed* to them.


Another reason not to give them anything now is this:

>My attorney says if I pay a single dollar, I am accepting the bill.


I can't imagine a judge looking at someone and telling them *""Hey remember when you were a baby and needed diapers? Remember all those clothes and shoes you needed growing up? Remember all the soap and water you needed to take baths as a kid? Remember all those birthday and Christmas presents your parents got you throughout your life? Guess what son, every cent your parents spent on you growing up, now you owe that back to them!""* I know IANAL, but I just can't imagine anyone in their right mind thinking that's right.

I’m worried about her. Even if you paid this, it wouldn’t stop there. She would guilt you into buying things for her and then nothing from you would ever be a true heartfelt gift to her, but just an obligation. It would deprive the giver and receiver of the true joy in doing good for others.

Thought… the most gracious one I can muster in response to her not deserving anything from you anyway, but especially after this..
if you were going to give her a larger sum than what is on this sheet anyway, then perhaps you can gift it to her with a carefully worded letter where you tell her this was the amount that you were planning to give to her anyway. The invoice was pitiful and you’re worried about her mental health and your relationship, which you had hoped was built on love that didn’t revolve around keeping a financial score. But this (the original amount you intended to give her) will be the only money you will give her because you can see that the $ has gotten in the way of having a healthy relationship. You will love her and still spend time as you did before, but you will never grant her any requests for money or gifts. And your gift is not in any way a response to her asking you for $, because it took all your will not to deny her so much as a penny after she let money become more important than your relationship. The joy of the gift you wanted to give was gone the moment she made it a demand instead.

Edit: I’ve definitely heard that getting $ makes a lot of people around you go crazy. Maybe be careful who you tell. Hoping for a better result and sorry she was like that

Last Edit: I said the joy of the gift was gone the moment she made it a demand.. but really, the more I think about it, generosity is it’s own gift despite whether or not the receiver deserves it. It was so kind of you to want to give to her in the first place. NOTHING can undo the goodness of giving from a gracious heart. You rock.",45

If these people view “taking care of a dependent family member person” as a business transaction—then business transactions they shall indeed have. 

I would charge them if they ask me to take care of them in their elderly years. 

You charged me rent, food, utilities, care, etc, for when I was a child and unable to work, you expect to get paid for taking care of me when I was able to work.  Fair is fair.  I expect to get paid for taking care of you, when you are unable to work.

Except you requesting to charge them money to take care of family is 100x nicer and more legal, because at least it is legal to give loans and financial contracts to adults.  

You cannot do that to a child.  Especially without consent.  It’s like kidnapping someone, holding them hostage for 18 years, and then expecting them to pay all the expenses acquired during that time frame they were there against their will.  Like, ummmm, I didn’t ask to be here.",2

Minors are not required to ""pay back"" the costs of living to their parents once they grow up and become adults.

-One sheet has a blacked out expense for 25k but it is dated 2015.  Between the sheets there's like 40k on here that is explicitly dated between late 2014 and 2016.

-There's not enough there to figure everything out from the interest, but there's some information there (I'm ignoring 2014 since OP says the interest wasn't running for part of that year and I don't know exactly what that means).  from 2015 to 2019 it grows each year by an about the amount that was the total in 2015, which is not very much compared to the size of the loan.  This indicates that the amount is not growing primarily due to compounding interest but due to growth in the principle.  If the principle is generated before 2014 and the interest rate is low then the total interest wouldn't change that much year to year.  If the interest rate is high enough to grow the total loan that much year to year then the amount from 2015 would have been much larger.

-There is another one of these itemized sheets under the first sheet has the same ledger layout with date - item - amount.  So there's definitely more of that.

Worst case scenario: he wrecked a $2k car as a teenager and his parents bought him another one, asked his parents to buy him computers throughout his childhood and college years, started a business, which failed, stayed rent free while in college, was unemployed after college for a while, his parents paid for the wedding, maybe a down payment on a house too.

Most parents who pay for all that don’t ask for it back in an invoice. If they ask for some money, it’ll be as a “hey son could you help us out with our mortgage, your dad is retired now.”

6346,t71chq,,"Op stated that these where charges for parents raising him til 18. However I took a look into his profile and he is 28. Meaning he turned 18 10 years ago which would mean it was 2012. However, the last page says interest started 2014 when he was 20(of legal age and that’s when money was given/borrowed). Which means these aren’t charges for the cost of raising him but after he turned 18.   Second picture date 10/10 google, 10/10 tickets, 10/10 gas, 10/10 squarespace, 10/10 squarespace (which has zero to do with raising a child but everything to do with a business) 3rd page car 1 and 2   2457 computer #2 1400 and last page car 1 and 2 charges for repairs tickets car rental( which again can’t happen before the age of 18 as OP states) a charge under fall 2014 when OP would’ve been 20 not under 18 and spring 2015 where op would’ve been 21( still not 18) and the interest on the loans each year. 2014 was when the interest began So it looks like either parents took out a loan or are charging him interest on a loan they gave him. But either way he was not given a bill charging him for the cost of being raised til he was 18 as he has stated and I personally believe based on him lying and trying to paint this as a completely different situation he had his parents loan him money and never paid it back and they’re asking because they need it.

Also, if this was really from your childhood - and there were charges listed on a daily basis - there should be hundreds of itemized amounts. I would also expect things insurance, medical care, clothes, etc.

I would also expect them to include costs you incurred while in college. 

Sorry, this doesn't make sense as a list of items spent to raise a child. This looks like things your parents bought and paid for when you were an adult. 

Whether you agreed to pay them back for these things or not, I cannot say, but I don't believe these are for childhood expenses.",4

Parents gave me dad’s car; I paid for half as that was (or I thought) the deal. Deer jumped on that car, hence the “repair” line item. Got another car after that one died that I thought was gifted to me ~$1,700.

I got a computer at 16. Started a website to learn about web design (SquareSpace and there is another in there that wasn’t included). Worked as a graphic artist until college.

Went to college, they only paid dorm fees and a single fraternity dues fee as I was still working at the time.

They did not pay for the wedding, ring, anything of that sort.

6417,t71chq,fairylightmeloncholy,"so.. i'm on the fence here. yes, OP was an adult and his parents were not obligated to cover his expenses in college- but they did. and if it wasn't communicated as a loan, and at the time given as a gift, and appreciated as a gift, then it's the parent's problem, not OP's. you can't agree to something you don't know about, and shifting from 'i'm taking care of you' to 'this was a loan' only because he came into money is gross as fuck.

as an adult i've lived with family when i've been struggling. they haven't charged me rent, and they've fed me. if, 5 years later i came into money and they DEMANDED an unagreed upon amount of rent to be paid to them, with an arbitrary amount of interest stacked on top, i'd likely not  have a relationship with them after that. our relationship benefited from the help that they offered, so to change that when it's convenient.. fuck that. just as i didn't demand or expect the help when i was struggling (i merely accepted when offered), they shouldn't demand or expect repayment. 

my mother helped greatly in my purchase of my laptop to go to college. as a gift to help me and my life. if i graduated and she sent me a bill, i'd feel violated and betrayed. 

i feel like we're missing some important details in this, but i def give the benefit of the doubt to OP. like, who tf expects to be paying for their boy scout fees as an adult?! with interest?!",9

OP already stated there was no earlier negotiation, no indication that they would ever be expected to pay for anything on this list (except I think OP said one car thing), that their parents were abusive growing up, and we already have the *huge red flag* of this going back to OP being nine years old. Your whole ""Well I can see your parents side *if*"" point is clearly already moot by your own admission, so you even going down that path when talking to an abuse victim who is clearly really, really hurting right now is kind of... not the most empathetic choice. A person in a situation like this needs support, not ""I can see your parents side under circumstances that are clearly not relevant to this situation,"" regardless of whether or not you added caveats like the one above.

It's a long-term goal and those take dedication, courage, soul-searching, and faith. In the end, you did it, and look how you are glowing! Absolutely beautiful.

My dear, there will probably be times in which you feel like giving up again. Remember the sheer fact that you completed this goal. You are stronger than you know. And also remember that the cost must be measured and weighed against the benefit. The cost includes recovery. Take the time and resources you need to recover. If you don't read another book for ten years, that is just fine. Support your mental health and find tools for resilience. Do what you need to do. You deserve all the best, and I mean that. It's not about the degree. It's about what YOU need for a happy life. Go out there and enjoy it.",1

6825,wk3azc,bookworthy,"My first birthday without my mom was so hard. I tried to think of a way to cut through the heaviness. It had only been 6 weeks since her passing, and my friends and family knew I was struggling, so I tried to be strong.   
I said to a few of them, “This us the first birthday my mom isn’t here for. I mean, she was there when I was *born*.”   
Some of them got it and some didn’t.   
But since my mom has a tricky sense of humor, I thought she’d approve. And she’d probably say, “Well, duuuh!”  

I won’t say happy birthday because to me it looks like there are some tears gathering, despite your smile. I will say that I hope your birthday can bring you memories of better times.",2

6882,wk3azc,Striking-Tangerine83,"Aww poor baby :'( I'm so sorry, that's a really tough one. 
There should be a PSA urging parents to make voice recordings of these kinds of things for their children to listen to when they are gone. My great-auntie used to make up a poem for all of us on our birthdays and I really miss that. It was the most special part of the day. 
Voices are just so important. 

I'm sorry you are missing that comfort today.
It's really special that your office was decorated for you, though! I'm sure your mom would be happy to know that someone was trying to honor you and make your day special. And I'm sure she was so proud of you.
XOXO

You were not someone else who is now gone. You have only become more you and I wish these kinds of parents could see that. You have not been replaced by someone else, you have just become a better version of yourself. A happier one, a more complete one, a you that you can feel good about. All we do in life is trying to grow, to better ourselves, to become more of the person we want to be. Sometimes it’s just a small thing like giving up smoking, taking up a hobby, removing toxic friends. Sometimes it’s a big thing like changing your appearance. But inside… you are always the same person. And I love every part of you. Son or daughter, it doesn’t matter. You’re family. You’re perfect.",14

7028,v61p6k,justletmereadalready,"Mom here: You look adorable!  

Also, I am guessing you only recently announced your true gender, so your mother probably just needs some time.  I speak from experience when I say it is so strange wrapping your head around finding out your child is not the gender assigned at birth and likely has a new name to go with the new pronouns.  Eventually your mother will figure out she hasn't lost a son while gaining a daughter and that you are the same person you have always been.

Of course, some parents have the sense to keep their struggles to themselves and not burden their child with them.  But that awkward silence says she is still processing.  Hopefully she will find a therapist or someone supportive of the LGBTQ+ community to talk to and be able to be the supportive parent you need again soon.  She will come around and there will be fun mother-daughter shopping trips in the future.

In the meantime, you have the moms on here to send you love and support.",38

When my first kid came out it took me a little while to understand just because I really didn't know anything. My daughter looked at me and said, ""It is still me, Mom. I am the same person"". It was then that I realized that I didn't know my kid as well as I thought I did but when I saw her flourish and blossom and come into her own it made all the difference in the world to me.

Keep doing you babe! All my years have taught me that we need to be true to who we are and not to deny that trying to make other people happy. I am very proud of you.",4

We talk a lot, and she’s even called me by my name a few times. I love her, but some days I just… need that same excitement she used to show me when I shared things I was proud of, like my grades or the gift I found for her birthday.

I wish - so, so much - that I could convince her and my dad to go to therapy, but they continually insist they’re making fine progress by themselves. Maybe one day she’ll be able to use my pronouns or say my name without hesitating beforehand. Maybe one day she’ll be ok calling me her daughter.

Wherever you fall on the spectrum between the two—go from there. Can you keep it up like this? Consider, too, do you want to have your child growing up watching her continually misgendering you and failing to have the bare minimum of respect for you?

7303,v61p6k,RasputinsButtBeard,"Have you actually looked it up? Being trans isn't a mental illness-- gender dysphoria is a mental illness that *can* occur in trans folks, but it can be alleviated and isn't an intrinsic, permanent aspect of being trans. 

Again, you need to [do your research.](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/) Here's over 50 peer-reviewed studies demonstrating that allowing trans people to transition and providing them with social support has great benefits for their wellbeing and quality of life.

[Conversion therapy doubles a trans person's risk of attempting suicide.](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-conversion-therapy-associated-severe-psychological-distress-n1052416) (**EDIT:** Sorry, *more* than doubles. And for trans kids, it increases the rate by 4x. But sure, you're looking out for people's best interests) So trying to force people to *stop* being trans sure isn't helping anyone. 

And speaking of suicide, the oft-touted attempt statistic used to slander trans people as inherently mentally ill is linked tremendously to instances of [rejection, abuse, discrimination, and violence.](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/suicidality-transgender-adults/)

It's not killing them with kindness, because trans people kill themselves because of people like you. If you can look at all of this and still feel determined to stick your head in the sand and deny reality, then you're beyond any help I or anyone else can offer you.",3
7304,v61p6k,HeavyPedal2204,It is not.,1
7305,v61p6k,RasputinsButtBeard,"????????

Okay. Let's walk through this, I wanna really dissect this thermonuclear take you just put down. So, let me get this straight--

Being trans was once deemed a mental illness, but as time went on, we realized that therapeutic/psychiatric interventions to cure people of being trans [didn't work and consistently did more harm than good](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-conversion-therapy-associated-severe-psychological-distress-n1052416), increasing the suicide attempt rate by more than double in trans adults, and quadrupling it in trans kids. 

Similarly, we realized that the high suicide attempt rate that was so often touted to justify pathologizing trans people is [a more external issue than internal, as it's linked heavily to instances of discrimination, abuse, hate, rejection, violence, etc.](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/suicidality-transgender-adults/)  

And furthermore, studies done on how transition and social support impact trans people [could not have been more clear in overwhelmingly demonstrating that medical transition and acceptance provide a substantial increase in quality of life.](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/) Altogether, evidence was clear that being trans is an innate quality in a person, an unchangeable aspect of who they are. The classification was updated accordingly, and so currently only gender *dysphoria* is considered a mental illness, one that *can* occur in trans people, but that can be alleviated. The best treatment outcome--per the studies linked above--comes about when trans people are allowed to live as their authentic selves. The dysphoria is treated, not their identity.

--And so in regards to your point: You believe that because this entire process occurred, that means that it by default actually *is* a mental illness, because..?

Because you say so? Do you think that because they were wrong in the past and changed as they got more information, that they must obviously just be wrong again? Have you been doing some revolutionary studies on the side that the rest of us just aren't aware of that'll completely shake up decades of intensive research by experts in the medical, sociological, and psychological fields? The consensus is very clear, so I'm sure the world of medicine (And more) would be astounded to hear your game-changing findings.

Gosh, I don't know why I didn't think about things like this before. Just because something is disproven, doesn't mean it's disproven! Good lord, the sky is the limit! Quickly, we should reexamine humorism; just because we realized germs exist doesn't mean they *actually* exist, and so just because we've determined there's no scientific basis for the theories behind humorism, that doesn't mean it isn't real!

..My God, the wandering wombs! We've been letting them run rampant all these years! Bring out the supplies for scent therapy, we have to cure the womenfolk of their ills! And we really should get back to lobotomizing the poor fools in the asylum.. Goodness knows that may truly be the only cure, because y'know, it just sorta *feels like it.*

✨Facts don't care about your feelings.✨ So unless you've got some actual, properly sourced facts to counter all of this, you might wanna go back to your echo chamber to be sure your pwecious feewings don't get hurt any further by reality. 🥺",1

7313,v61p6k,HeavyPedal2204,And science has disproved it as one. So no. It isn’t.,1
7314,v61p6k,RasputinsButtBeard,"That might've been because it was nonsensical and incoherent. Charitably, it's an inane, enlightened centrist catch-22. 

>""if you think it isn't a mental illness cuz it was only one in the past before we learned more about the subject, then you can't say that what we learned actually disproves the original classification! It changed before, so it could change again!"" 

-is a complete non-argument. It ignores the entire concept of scientific progress and the mechanisms with which we're able to more accurately understand ourselves and the world around us over time. 

The increasing understanding we have regarding trans people isn't something that came about in a bubble; our understandings of psychology, sociology, medicine, etc, have all improved over time, and with that we've been able to make strides in further examining and understanding an innumerable amount of subjects, and trans people are just one of them. Our capacity for research is ever-compounding, and so I feel like my response was pretty reasonable. 

If you find reason to doubt the current scientific consensus as a layman because it used to be different and could theoretically change back (Despite not having any evidence to justify shrugging off the veracity of the countless studies that have been done in recent years), then that same logic can be applied to quite literally everything we understand about our reality. We disproved the idea that lobotomies are the best treatment for psychiatric disorders, have decades of research demonstrating that other treatment methods have better outcomes, but by your logic, that isn't proof: our understanding changed in the past, so it could change again, and thus we might as well not take a side either way.

Given all you had to say was ""no lol, you got it wrong!"" without any actual explanation as to what I apparently misunderstood, and the fact that you neither provided any counters to the sources I linked backing up my point, nor any reliably sourced facts to back up *your* argument (That I'd asked you directly for), I'm kinda getting the impression that I both wasn't really that far off, and that you never actually *had* any material cause to doubt the idea that being trans isn't a mental illness. And if that's the case, it's pretty silly of you to have tried acting like there's an argument to be made without having done any research on the subject. 😊

I try to correct misinformation when I come across it, but I'm not interested in playing tit-for-tat with people who can't even bother pretending they're arguing in good faith. Unless you have some relevant, accredited sources to back up your notion that scientific progress regarding trans people means nothing, don't expect any further responses from me.",3

If you are looking to put even more meaning behind your event planning, where I am (Cincinnati) I have a friend that does event planning but she specializes in doing events for Non Profits. If you are great with a budget and ready to flex that creativity, you can help raise a lot of money for charity by helping them put on a thoughtful and fun event.
ETA: she does charge. We have had that talk a lot since I too work for many arts organizations. It can feel wrong to charge a non profit, but you need to eat as well and your gifts will help them raise more money than a boring party. You are worth it.",3

It doesn't matter how old we are- we always yearn for parental figures. And to have that, in a way that's safe and secure, is such a beautiful thing. 

I wish all of you the absolute best, and I think it's incredibly thoughtful of you to consider the joy it'd bring them to experience choosing a name together. As a new parent, I can say it is a big deal. All of you sound like great humans. ❤️❤️✌️",2

7578,v45sha,seafish83,"This is awesome. I understand the desire to change your middle name. My middle name was also my mother’s first name (and my grandmother’s middle name). When I got married. My maiden last name became my middle name (because it is my father’s last name and he eventually got his act together and realized all the shit my mom put my brother and I through-they got divorced), and I took my husband’s last name. It was a wonderful feeling not to be tied to her that way anymore. I can’t explain it. She’s still around, but we are almost no contact, and I don’t think she even knows I did that.",2

So by changing my middle and last name I lose my bio fathers last name and lose my bio mothers first name.........now I get my Dad’s last name and my middle name is a name him and Mom chose specifically for me, and they got to experience naming a child together.

I feel the need to explain that (as well as add another comment that practically has no punctuation whatsoever*this*) rather than have you think that I've never heard of a comma or period . (or, you know, just going back and, idk, fixing it? LOL)

Part of me wants to decline and be independent but part of me knows I’ll shut down and seclude myself, so it’s calming to know my Mom and Dad are willing to take care of me for a few days until I get my emotions regulated again.

Just because I’m getting adopted doesn’t mean my trauma and insecurities are manically healed. I’m still gonna struggle sometimes but I’ll find a different community for support",1
7828,v45sha,setanddrift,I'd imagine all the emotions would be pretty overwhelming. Crying is a good way to deal with it. And now you have a family to hug you and dry your tears!!,7

7830,v45sha,alto2,"Your dad in particular seems to be pretty well tuned in to you, so yeah, I think they’ll be able to figure out a lot without you even saying anything (not that communication isn’t always important, of course, but when words fail, I think they’ll be pretty clueful). I wouldn’t worry about that too much.

If you have a favorite form of exercise, it might not be a bad idea to really get a good workout in tomorrow to help your body release some of the energy of the last few days. But it can also be helpful just listen to your body’s signals. If you’re tired, rest. If you’re amped up, find a way to use that energy. If you’re hungry, eat…if you’re not, don’t force yourself. Same with sleep. And don’t judge it. Your body knows what it needs even when your brain has no clue. 

Journaling could be interesting, too, if that feels right—getting all those emotions out on paper helps them feel more like something that’s a part of us, but not all of us, if that makes sense. But that’s enough of me spitballing. You’ll do what feels right and this weird OMG WHAT JUST HAPPENED phase will work it’s way through. 😊",1

7836,v45sha,No-Introduction6087,"Momma of 4 here, chosen and biological, and fellow survivor of abusive home so get feeling like a bother. The reality is there is nothing that would mean more to me as my young adult’s chosen mom than to get to be trusted to be there for her. She struggles with feeling unworthy/not asking for help too and when I find out she was hurting and didn’t reach out to me, i feel like she doesn’t want us, I’m not a good enough mom, and wonder what I could have done more to show her that we mean what we say and she is worth it. Kids come to their parents rooms when they need comfort in the middle of the night and a normal loving parent delights to be their safe place. They have said they want you to stay with them so they can support you. Believe them. Going to her shows her that you view her as mom and you believe her words that she loves you. This honors her. If you’re still up, consider gently going to your mom and doing your best to tell her. You could write it down on a sticky note and give to her through tears if it’s too hard to say. “Mom, can you hold my hand while I fall asleep?” Or “can I sleep on the floor beside your bed tonight to feel safe?” Don’t feel embarrassed of asking for care. You are never too old for that. You are worth it and always have been (should have gotten this as a little girl too- cue all the mixed emotions 😩)  And they sound worthy of the role of being fully your parents. Much love to you  💕💜",7

7839,v45sha,,"I ended up falling asleep before you posted this. They noticed I’m a little not myself this morning when I came downstairs. 

Mom Immediately asked me if I was having second thoughts, I told her I had 0% second thoughts and that I feel like I’m overwhelmed with 48 hours of a lot of extreme emotions and just want to settle myself.

She was in the middle of finishing cooking breakfast and Dad was waiting for coffee to finish so he came and sat on the couch with me and put an arm around me and let my lean against him for a while. 

He asked why I didn’t wake them up and I said I didn’t want to bother them, Dad assured me the point of me staying here a couple days is so I have 24/7 access for them to help me through this.",8
7840,v45sha,,That’s a good point,2
7841,v45sha,No-Introduction6087,Yay for communicating that so well to them! That is well said. I celebrate your courage and self awareness to explain that clearly to them and also communicate your need to settle/center. Communicating like that is so important because it puts their own insecurities at ease and helps them know how to care for you. I am proud of you! You are so brave.,2

I told her she didn’t have to do that, but she insisted that if I need to lay low for a few days and settle my emotions then for right now we’re just going to enjoy the three of us and have a few calm days",2
7844,v45sha,,"It definitely feels like a long 48 hours, I’m glad Dad suggested My dog and I stay at their house a few more days and lay low and let them take care of me while I work through some emotions. I think him and Mom are afraid the roller coaster I’ve been on is going to get to me and I’ll crash emotionally.

7846,v45sha,,Yea there’s definitely lots of emotions and when we left the lawyers office Dad noticed I was quiet so that’s when he suggested I let them take care of me for a few days so I can just exist and work through emotions and not be alone (I tend to shut down emotionally if I’m alone too much then it takes them a week or two to help me get back to normal),3

They do the same with their other kids, even at their other kids ages is not uncommon for one of them to hangout for a day or two when having a tough emotional time. Even their spouses and kids come to stay with them. 

My parents naturally have caregiver personalities so the thrive off all of us letting them take care of us in different ways",1

I said, “Hi Sweetheart,” and hubs said,”hey hon!” Then I asked her to walk to the bathroom with me… but some of the staff and i helped her with a safe exit out of the back door (not a public exit) and the bouncer walked her to her car. We had never met her and never saw her again",7

When I was 13 and taking an evening stroll in my neighborhood, a woman literally begged to give me a ride home out of fear and concern that I would get attacked or abducted. She claimed that she had been attacked recently and was afraid for my safety.

I got so scared, I tried to go to different stores but he was always 20 feet behind me, he took pictures of me and I totally panicked! I saw a mom with her school aged kid and ran to her, told her that he was following and taking pics of me (this was before cell phones were popular, he legit had a disposable Kodak) she grabbed me with both arms and told me I was going to be ok and I was her daughter now.

They were walking in patterns that didn’t make sense, would go down the same aisle as me or the teen girls and pretend to look at something then put it back, walked past way too close multiple times, etc. I had enough of them circling us and called my bf (who luckily works in a building two minutes from the store) to come walk me and our daughter out to the car. Traffickers also commonly target women with young children as they have their back turned putting them in the car seat. After calling him I approached the girls and told them I’m not sure who the men were after but something was very wrong with the situation and they needed to be escorted to their car.

7964,t921z8,izzgo,"I'm sorry to hear that. 

If some creep is following you and/or harassing you in public, odds are pretty danged good that whoever you might approach for help is not a creep (because most people are not creeps). Also, if someone approaches you for help, unless you're being asked to do something risky to yourself, most likely you're in no danger.",4
7965,t921z8,Chateaudelait,This mom can help you - two sharp punches to the throat.  I always loved that line from Clueless about the shovel and I doubt anyone would miss you.,6
7966,t921z8,bellYllub,"I don’t know, I think most women are so conscious of creeps in public that if *anyone* came up to them, regardless of who they are, and loudly pretended “Hey, how are you, long time no see!” followed by a quiet “Help, this weirdo is following me! Can you help me out?” … yeah, almost every woman would catch on quickly and immediately take you under their wing and try to get you away from the situation you’re in.

I’ve done this exact thing for multiple people over the years. The moment someone I don’t know approaches me, wild eyed and frantic and goes “Hey!! It’s been so long!” I immediately know to play along and get them as far away from the person targeting them as I can.

For many women, harassment is just part of life and we’re usually willing to help out anyone that feels unsafe.

***Edited to add:*** My husband has been with me a few of those times and he’s since become so aware of creepy behaviour that he’s actually stepped in without being asked a couple of times when he’s seen someone that’s clearly uncomfortable. He stops and goes “Omg, how are you, not seen you for a while!”

Both times the victim immediately responded with the kind of “Oh wow, hi! I’m great, how are you?”

The creeps have immediately backed off because another man is a threat.

Sucks that it has to be that way but whether man/woman/whoever, we can all help combat those evil bastards!",3

7974,siy7nj,CapnHatchmo,"I've been struggling with addiction for a long time, and the realization that every step (however small it might be) counts has been a great epiphany for me. Like, even if I don't make it through a whole month sober, there are still the days during that month that I *was* sober, and those count.

A similar mentality can, and, I think, should, be applied to many situations in life. Maybe you didn't clean the whole house like you planned, but you got a load of laundry run and that's something. Maybe you didn't meet a deadline at work, but you learned more about how to deal with that type of issue next time.

Every step is progress, and all progress is valid.",111

The real questions:

What are you doing for shoes? How about gold heels? With your height and your hair color gold might pop nicely?

What about accessories? Big dangle statement earrings? The bodice has such lovely detail and compliments your decolatge (sp?) that I recommend no necklace.",2

Enjoy the day! Try to take a few moments to just stop and look around. It flies by and pictures barely do it justice so alone, with your partner during the ceremony, with your partner at the reception....just pause and soak it in. All your love for each other, the love of everyone in attendance, it can be overwhelming but can also be missed if you're too caught up in the plans/movement of the day.",2

8291,va98uk,CallMeCleverClogs,"You look lovely! I know you are going to have an amazing day!  I am not sure what sort of shoe you plan on, but I do recommend something comfy even if you have to change into them - my friend hand beaded a pair of Keds for me and I was so grateful to get out of my high heels. 

Seconding times a million the folks saying EAT - and I will add hydrate like mad to that also. Navigating the restroom in a gown kind of sucks but dehydration and headaches are worse, love, I promise. 

If I was coming, I would have a little zipper pouch of tylenol, needle and thread, safety pins, concealer/powder, spare lipstick, hairspray, bobby pins, and a couple band aids to keep nearby, just in case. (I know, I am THAT mom)  Maybe someone close to you and your wife can sub in my neurotic self and make an emergency kit for an just in cases, for my peace of mind. Hahaha. ENJOY YOUR DAY!",2

8683,va98uk,WolfCola4,"One thing we're doing is putting the maid of honour and best man on guard duty - people have good intentions and want to come up to congratulate you, but you need a chance to eat some food in peace! This is the most expensive meal you're likely to have if you're paying for the guests, you need a chance to enjoy it! MOH and best man can gently redirect people to come back during the dancing.",5

When I got married the venue had their own event planner who guarded our table when it was time for food and made sure no one came up to us. She even boxed up the leftovers!

Also pack a travel size of tylenol or advil, even happy events can bring on stress headaches!❤️",2

My mother insisted I be a good host and speak to every single person there (300+) then it was time for cake and toasts and dances. I wound up in a McDonald’s drive thru in my wedding gown @ 2am. Explaining mustard stains to the dry cleaner was hilarious. 

Second time I knew better, I sat and ate and enjoyed my new husband. 

Your guest can wait while y’all eat and enjoy some downtime. Don’t be like me all hangry at the end of the night. This is you and your wife’s day. Eat that food you’re paying so much for!",57

8727,va98uk,kirinspeaks,Yay!,2
8728,va98uk,Vegetable-Shock,She was actually a friend of the family and her gift to me was cleaning and preserving my dress. When I brought it in she looked at me and deadpan said “I should have gotten you the blender” before she cracked up!  We had the entire store laughing when I re-enacted my mom dragging me around to meet her friends who I’d never seen before and would never meet again.,22
8729,va98uk,Vegetable-Shock,"This was back when Netflix was dvds in little red paper envelopes. (Just aged myself hard lol) So it was more like scarfing a qtr pounder, speeding down I10 while singing along to The Flaming Lips, and trying to sneak my now ex-husband’s fries. 

This was over 10 years ago but the girl in the window (she’s the GM now) still likes to tell the story of the late night bride who gave everyone on shift a $20 bill unpinned from her (my) veil as a tip, but only after they hummed the wedding March that I conducted with a French fry.  I was extremely tipsy from the whole no food but many toasts situation lol. 

It’s the only part of my first wedding I like to talk about haha. Almost everything else was a comedy of errors. From being 45 min late, not having enough  chairs, and the DJ going rouge. But the piece de resistance was my uncle standing in front of the video camera so it looks like I was saying my vows to a giant ass. Which as it turned out was very prophetic lol.",8
8730,w34mb3,asghettimonster,"Kiddo, you have a great therapist. And if you keep on keepin on with drawing, you will be a great artist. Never, ever, ever give up, and never, ever, ever rely on one person's judgement of you xo from a granny",137
8731,w34mb3,Simply_Gabriele,"You have an eye for composition and strong positive/negative space. Many ""good"" amateur artists lack that, so don't let that old nagging voice in whatsoever. Keep it up, don't ever be afraid to explore new horizons, you're doing amazing.",63
8732,w34mb3,PenguinZombie321,"Anyone can draw. Not everyone can draw well, but that shouldn’t stop anyone from having fun. That said, you clearly have talent and if this is something you enjoy doing, nurture it. 

I think there’s probably a lot that your birth person has said that you shouldn’t believe. You can draw. What else was she wrong about? 

Btw I think #3 is my favorite",159
8733,w34mb3,sweetart1372,"You, my little duckling, are an ARTIST.  And you have been since the day you picked up a pencil.  My personal favorite is the first one.  I personally know how difficult portraiture can be and I think your work is amazing.  Keep up the fantastic work!",41

8738,w34mb3,MotherRainbow,"Your drawings are so lovely! I know it’s hard, but try not to worry about the people who rag on things you enjoy. Talent is something that grows when it os nurtured, and I’m so glad your therapist is encouraging you to nurture your own talent.",7
8739,w34mb3,babamum,Egg donor was either jealous or didn't appreciate  art. Or both!,4
8740,w34mb3,CNDRock16,You have a gift! Explore it!!!,4
8741,w34mb3,CAPTCHA_is_hard,"Oh wow, I'm so glad you listened to your therapist! You obviously have talent. I'm an artist and I can say that you have a good eye for values -  the contrast between light and dark areas. And I like your composition of shapes. 

Seems like you were drawing your emotions? I feel that coming through in them.

Anyway, I wish you luck on your therapy journey toward healing and peace. And I hope you have a ton of fun on your artistic journey as well. It can be a lifelong love affair if you let to be :)",5
8742,w34mb3,mpierre,"What's up with them and saying their kids can't draw?

When I was 8 perhaps, I began tracing ships and trains. I liked those big vehicles. Oh, and some planes.

She insisted that tracing was not drawing and that I was cheating and wasting my time.

And yet, I was getting used to the feeling of the pencil on the paper, and how things work. I was fucking EIGHT.

After too much criticism, I just stopped.

I guess I should trace again, for fun, and see if it can lead somwhere, because your drawings, are REALLY cool.",4
8743,w34mb3,part-time-unicorn,I really like the second one. It captures something i cant communicate with words but really relate to,4

8751,w34mb3,Moon_Mistress,These are wonderful! Anyone telling someone they cannot make art well is entirely missing the point of art.,2
8752,w34mb3,GrizeldaLovesCats,"This is amazing. You have real talent and should use it to make yourself happy and to express yourself. Ignore your birth person because they are clearly an idiot. It is a great life policy to not listen to what idiots say about you. Their opinions, stupid as they are, are not your business. So ignore them. We had to do that with my FIL regarding my Hub's art. FIL had almost no impact on our life and now? I don't even speak to him. He literally isn't worth the cost of a phone call on my unlimited everything plan.",2

8759,w34mb3,snugglebug72,Birth people can be our biggest roadblocks to happiness,2
8760,w34mb3,boxcarsewing," I’m an art teacher, so I’m very highly qualified to say:

1. This is art, and it’s wonderful.
2. You are an artist, and fighting through criticism has only made your art more poignant for it (like, idk, this kinda unknown artist named VAN GOGH, who was ridiculed for his work while alive).
3. Your birth person can go sit in syrup.

I’m so proud of you!!",2
8761,w34mb3,RugelBeta,"Honey, I make my living as a professional illustrator. I can draw. YOU CAN TOO. This is fabulous work.

My advice: keep drawing, keep doodling. It doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be done. That's how we improve. And you are starting at a higher level than I did.

Pro tip: keep some of your early work so you can compare yourself to it -- never to other artists, but to yourself. You will be amazed at how you grow.",2
8762,w34mb3,aviva1234,I'm a highly trained artist and I'm telling you that you're good.,1

8766,w34mb3,JustSteph80,"Hey sib, I think you're really talented!
I especially like #2, it reminds me of how I felt when I first started therapy & started untangling the mess in my head. My head still isn't as orderly as I'd like it, but thank you for the reminder of how far I've come. ❤️

Keep going on your healing journey; I promise it's worth it.",1
8767,w34mb3,jennabunnykins,Sibling here! You have a lot of the basics down and a really keen eye for shading and detail. Keep practising— you are only going to get better and better from here!!,1

8769,w34mb3,NewSpark92,"These are beautiful sweetheart. But, maybe more importantly, they're so expressive. Practice makes perfect, sure, but the creative flare, the deep emotions they instill, that's all you. It was always inside of you. I am so happy to see it grow.",1
8770,w34mb3,joyAunr,"I see a ton of art on reddit, i must say I like yours the most, I feel like there's life behind theses drawings.",1
8771,w34mb3,KLR01001,I *really* like your artwork. Just because someone says something about you doesn’t make it true. This is a great example. You’re gonna do so great in life!,1

8775,w34mb3,queentropical,"What beautiful pictures. All three of my daughters are artists like you… a good friend of mine recently learned how to draw and actually has the talent, as well. I love it when people discover and pursue art. I wish I could say that I can’t imagine a mother who would stifle and shut down their own child’s talent, but sadly I can. Please keep drawing, you’re incredibly good at it.",1

8783,w34mb3,astrovixen,"Non birth mother here saying you keep going my dear, and you let go of all that hurt in your heart. It's a weight that does not serve you. These are beautiful, and you are loved. I'm so very proud of you.",1

8787,w34mb3,Rthrowaway6592,"Charcoal is one of my favourite mediums...it's so much fun! Seriously beautiful work...that first portrait is so gorgeous. Really good eye for expression and negative space. Your talent is natural, nuture it my little chicken ❤",1
8788,w34mb3,Squidwina,"That first one is so amazing. It has the “Mona Lisa effect” on me.  It makes me wonder who she is?  What she’s thinking?  What emotions are hidden behind her expression?

Plus, it’s simply a beautiful face. 

Do you mind if I print it out?",1
8789,w34mb3,damarafl,Your art is amazing! We have fallen into this weird trap of thinking we need to monetize our hobbies and we do not.,1
8790,w34mb3,ClimateCare7676,"All 4 of them are excellent. They seem to be made with charcoal, and I always felt like charcoal is a difficult but a very expressive media on its own. I love the little creature in the last picture. Whoever told you you can't draw is completely wrong. You have a real thing for art!",1

8806,w34mb3,CAPTCHA_is_hard,That's such a wise takeaway. I need to remember to get my emotions out more in the same way. Thanks for the reminder.,1
8807,w34mb3,coldbrewicedcoffeee,"Amazing!!! She was just jealous, but you are an artist and do not let anyone tell you otherwise!!!!",1
8808,w34mb3,Norpu01,"You certainly have the talent. If you want to improve: practice, take some lessons, and copy the masters and practice some more. Art is more about having fun and doing what you love.",1

8811,w34mb3,luberne,"I never felt so much strong feelings for some drawings, incredible!",2
8812,w34mb3,eland57,Wonderful! I’m an art therapist and I love to draw as well. It’s very grounding and meditating. My birth mother (rip) often laughed at my attempts even tho she was an artist herself. Some people like the power they feel when putting others down. Especially if they feel the person “needs” the encouragement.,1
8813,w34mb3,HookahMagician,"Thank you, granny!",30
8814,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thank you!,10
8815,w34mb3,HookahMagician,"Oh gosh, so many things that I shouldn't/don't believe anymore. We haven't spoken in years and breaking that tie was the best decision of my life. 

Therapy is really hard but rewarding. :)",88

8819,w34mb3,HookahMagician,"Thank you. 💙 I have a dissociative disorder and that is what it feels like when I dissociate. That is my therapists office that you can see really small in the clear part of the drawing. Underwater, far away, and noisy is how it feels for me when I dissociate.",10

8821,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thank you!,3
8822,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Possibly both. We'll never know now because she's not allowed to be a part of my life anymore.,9
8823,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thank you!,1
8824,w34mb3,HookahMagician,"Thanks :)

Yes, most of my stuff is actually abstract. I've always had a hard time expressing emotion because we didn't learn that skill as a kid. Discovering that I could express emotion using charcoal was a huge deal. I'm amazed how often just getting my emotions out of my head and on to paper can help me process what I'm feeling and then move past it rather than just getting caught in the same bed mental loop.",3
8825,w34mb3,HookahMagician,You should give a whirl again. :),3
8826,w34mb3,cwglazier,Yes you should try again. I kinda put up stuff for while too but I still have sketchbooks and other things I have done. I treated myself to some good watercolor paper and some brushes etc just to play with. I also love charcoal or pencils that have the different grades of shade and darkness.,1
8827,w34mb3,cwglazier,Me too,1
8828,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thank you :),2

8835,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thanks :) I haven't been on speaking terms with birth person in years and that was the best decision I ever made in my life.,2
8836,w34mb3,HookahMagician,"Oh gosh, I started with my therapist because she specializes in dissociative disorders thinking the art therapy stuff wasn't going to apply to me. Glad she does art therapy because who knows when I would have tried this out otherwise. Thank you!",3
8837,w34mb3,cwglazier,Agreed.,1
8838,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thank you!,2

8855,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thanks.,1
8856,w34mb3,HookahMagician,"Thank you! Yeah, he was pretty great. :) I'm taking an oil painting class from him right now and we'll just say that charcoal drawing is clearly more my thing. Lol. I can't mix colors to save my life. Love charcoal though so I'm not upset about it.",2
8857,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Maybe? Most of my other stuff is on the abstract side and feels a lot more personal and scary for sharing just because it's all emotion around trauma.,2
8858,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thank you. 💙,1
8859,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thank you! 💙,1
8860,w34mb3,HookahMagician,"Not at all, that warms my heart to know someone likes it that much. 💙",2
8861,w34mb3,HookahMagician,I don't. I wouldn't even know where to start on trying to do that.,2
8862,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thank you! 💙,1
8863,w34mb3,HookahMagician,"I actually have no idea who she is. Lol. We used a picture in the charcoal drawing class as a prompt so she's a stranger to me. 

I don't mind if you print it out.",2
8864,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Amen to that. Once you have monetized something it stops being a hobby.,1
8865,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thank you!,2

8867,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Thank you!,1
8868,w34mb3,interstellargalaxy,Great therapist for suggesting it but YOU gave her a listen and a try. Kudos to you,10
8869,w34mb3,cwglazier,"I wondered what the center of the pic was. I could see a bookcase and someone slumped over in a chair with what might be a refrigerator, lol. I like that one alot.",2
8870,w34mb3,ThePurplePoet,"I was literally so drawn to that picture because it spoke to me as someone with a dissociative disorder (derealization). Seeing this comment makes so much sense! Not only is your art good as far as lines and appearances, but it definitely invokes the feelings that you're intending to portray.",2
8871,w34mb3,swordsmithy,I love the third one! Let us know if you ever start selling these!,1
8872,w34mb3,Privileged_Interface,Sound like a narcissist. And afraid that you might be more talented or successful than her.,3
8873,w34mb3,babamum,I'm pleased to hear it.,1
8874,w34mb3,cwglazier,It doesn't matter. You just have to unlearn some of the damage that she has passed on to you.,1
8875,w34mb3,cwglazier,I can totally see that. Sometimes you start on one thing and then realize throughout the process that you are showing something else.,1
8876,w34mb3,mpierre,"After writing that. I began watching how to draw on your computer. I am more discouraged than anything, but hey, I have a plane book, I could start with that.

All of the tutorials were about drawing people, and honestly, I never tried.",4
8877,w34mb3,cwglazier,Agreed. Art is such a release and you can draw/paint any damn thing you want to.,2
8878,w34mb3,GrizeldaLovesCats,"I have always been appreciative that my inlaws were just not interested in Hubs or our family. They wanted to trot us out like show ponies when it benefited their image at church and ignore us the rest of the time. Also, Hubs was the scapegoat. So if I didn't mention contacting FIL, Hubs wasn't going to contact him. We were happier when I didn't mention it.",2
8879,w34mb3,cwglazier,Keep trying it out. It doesn't matter if it is a masterpiece but it's deffinatly a good way to express yourself.,1
8880,w34mb3,cwglazier,"Having someone there to teach values and highlights in painting is a great thing. I used to love Bob Ross immensely. I did okay but the tips my teacher gave me about adding in a color that I just wouldn't have thought of made my paintings so much better. Nothing wrong with black, whites and Grey either.",1
8881,w34mb3,galqbar,"I understand, no problem. You *can* draw and thanks for sharing.",1
8882,w34mb3,Squidwina,"That makes it even more amazing. You were able to bring so much life to her.  

Please keep drawing.  You’re so talented and creative.",1
8883,w34mb3,cwglazier,"Some therapist are actually useful. I had to do some for court and it felt like punishment rather than something to help me. A couple have truly been helpful and more so when they encourage you. And yes, you did this for yourself.",3
8884,w34mb3,HookahMagician,I think what you're seeing as possibly a refrigerator are the windows in her office.,5
8885,w34mb3,HookahMagician,"Running theory by myself and some siblings is a bad case of Borderline Personality Disorder. There's nothing wrong with mental illness, but not getting help is the real problem. Total black and white on everything and a constant shifting of what she thinks is truth and reality. 

Mostly now I pity her. Deep down I'm sure she understands how abusive she was to all of us and she has to live with that knowledge and the pain of slowly losing all of her family as we one by one cut contact. I can never remember her being genuinely happy. I may have a bunch of shit left to work through thanks to her, but at least I don't have to carry the burdens that she does. What a horrible, miserable life she has and she has only herself to blame for that.",8
8886,w34mb3,coldbrewicedcoffeee,Yes!!! I was thinking the same thing.,1
8887,w34mb3,HookahMagician,I found a class at a local art place. The price wasn't too bad and it was amazing having somewhere there that could I could watch in real time and get advice when things weren't working the way that I expected.,3
8888,w34mb3,cwglazier,People are hard to draw. Start with some basic shapes and shading again maybe.,1
8889,w34mb3,cwglazier,Possibly but I did like to look in there and see what was in the center. I like that one alot.,2
8890,w34mb3,Privileged_Interface,"And some might say..""But that's your mother."".  
  
How you and your siblings were treated. That's not a family. At least you have some peace now, and less stress.",2
8891,w34mb3,mpierre,"Oh... I am not there yet... but it's not a bad idea.

My plane book is too complex, but I just recalled that I bought drawing book lessons for my kid so they wouldn't have those problems.

I'll start with that!",3
8892,w34mb3,cwglazier,"My art teacher was my favorite teacher,  no surprise there. She actually gave me a little pin/award that said I was learning techniques and using them in my art. Apparently other teachers were surprised at this since I was doing basic work in some of their classes.",1
8893,w34mb3,HookahMagician,Keep us updated on how it goes. :),2
8894,w34mb3,cwglazier,Good idea and learning together could be a great experience.,1

Don’t you dare feel bad for a minute that you need to take care of yourself.  Don’t feel bad that you don’t have superhuman powers to be everywhere 24/7 for her, and don’t feel bad that you can’t avoid sleeping, eating, work, school, pooping, visiting your own friends, self care, fine alone, and whatever else you need as a human to exist and be healthy. 

It is important to let yourself have breaks, for mental health and physical health.  It is important to take care of your own life needs too honey.  Even if you care for her more than your own self, think of it like this: you’re less good for her, if you are tired/stressed/sick/weak/drained/fried by not taking care of yourself. 

Although you shouldn’t care for her more than you care for yourself. You should care for her equally to yourself and love yourself equal to how you love her.  Because you’re both two beautiful human beings made in God’s image worthy equally of love and care.  Don’t view yourself as less worthy of care than her—that can accidentally become a toxic mentality with caregivers.  Over-martyrdom. 

You are also an equal human being who is worth comfort, safety, warm bed, sleep, good food, etc.  You’re just as important to take care of as she is.  Don’t put yourself as less important than her.  You’re both equal humans. ❤️

So you’re helping 2 beautiful good humans (her and you) by taking care of yourself. 

Just explain to her why you cannot stay.  That you’re only human, and human beings cannot do everything.  That you need to go home and rest and stuff.  And explain that it doesn’t mean you love her any less—it just means your human brain and human body has limits.",1

9006,waippe,Undrende_fremdeles,"I agree.

Not because it has to be a secret that it can be heard, but because this is another way to show respect for another person.

There are plenty of times where we are experiencing something, but do not want to talk about it, or want to love on from it. Other people can ask ""everything okay? You seem upset"", but you just say it's fine, nothing special.

As long as it isn't passive aggressive or you're clammed up but actually want to talk about it, then letting someone else move past whatever it was is a sign of respect. Letting them not pull whatever it was with them for the rest of the day, but leave it behind so to speak.

If you get the sense she would be genuinely upset that you can hear it, then maybe let her know that you can hear her talk to her Ellie. I would lie about being able to understand it (if I did) since it was obviously not meant for my ears, though.

If it is a way to keep tabs of her in a way you otherwise won't be able to, but need to, then don't say anything at all.

Adults keep tabs on kids without letting on all the time. Then we adjust our lives in small ways here and there based on everything we know, day to day.

Same goes for telling family members about their own kids if you've had them over. Particularly if it's something they would maybe like to be made aware of. Be it something troublesome, or something awesome :)",65

If you have an Ikea near you, they have little wooden beds in the kids section, play food, and **so many stufties**. Though she might not be into going to IKEA if crowds are an issue, I assume crowds would enhance anxiety.

 I would put a pair of old-fashioned toy telephones on the shopping list as well. And a play grocery store, and some menus for the tea party. (My kids had a lot of toys, lol) 

I am not sure what her diagnosis is, this site is interesting if you haven't seen it already: https://www.selectivemutism.org/how-to-help-child-with-selective-mutism/

Also, you might consider placing an Apple Airtag inside Ellie. And an note/phone number inside her outfits.

9019,waippe,sixthandelm,"I think in this case (from reading OP’s other post) her sister/cousin is refusing to speak because she’s been traumatized by a specific past event or events, which is a delicate situation. Her talking will only happen if she’s very comfortable in her surroundings and people, and getting excited will remove any relaxed feelings she had that allowed her to speak in the first place. 

Yours (unless they’ve witnessed something traumatizing) sound like it is likely due to their temperament or a physical or neurological reason. Many kids with mild autism (mild autism is not a good name, you either have it or you don’t, but I mean autism where they don’t need much help like what used to be called Asperger’s), speech impediments or hearing complications start talking late. My SIL’s child had problems with his Eustachian tubes in his ears not draining and he could hear but it was muffled. He didn’t start talking until he had tubes put in that kept them open, and now he speaks and hears normally. If it’s temperament it might be something like ODD or a personality disorder that makes them defiant or unable to stay calm enough to talk instead of scream. In all these cases the reason isn’t life threatening but it can be serious or set them back if it’s not followed up or treated, so it’s good that you’re getting it looked into.",1

Thank you for responding. I really do appreciate the advice. Not everyone would know to get them help because of the stories I've heard that people told me ""he's fine. Mine didn't start talking until he was 4 and now he won't shut up"" the earlier you can get kids help, the better.",17

You know they're well aware of what you want them to do, but will they do it? Nope. 

And the yelling and screaming. It's not all out of anger. He yells and screams when he's excited. He'll say ""oooooh"" a lot. He's tried saying a few things but he doesn't keep trying to and stops when you try to encourage him to talk with a big smile on his face.",8

Taken things away. Repeatedly told him every time why he was in trouble and what he did. ""We don't scream. Inside voice. Quiet""

I haven't had this much trouble with my 5 year old at all. I'm at a loss right now. He would walk off/run towards the road constantly but fortunately he's quit that for the most part.

If you take your eyes off him for a minute, he can disappear and roam around the surrounding area as if he doesn't understand there's a problem and that he's in trouble for doing so. Hes been in trouble for that kind of thing numerous times. I can't tell if he's just not getting it or he is and he doesn't care. If he's too smart for his own good. 

The kinds of things he likes to watch are educational like number blocks, letter and word shows, cocomelon sometimes, and the magic schoolbus, storybots.  As a baby he constantly took in his surroundings. Very low maintenence. Didn't have to be constantly entertained. Never had trouble teaching him to go to bed and fall asleep on his own. He's very observant. With how many times he's watched shows about numbers, letters and words. It wouldn't surprise me if he knew how to count from 1-20 at least. He's gotten excited when I've written his name and said each letter, making me think he's smarter than what he's willing to show. He's constantly going. I can't get him to sit down and pay attention for a project or listen. I set stuff up around him and he immediately wants to play in it. 

Like I was trying to plant a flower bulb with him as a fun little project that could be his flower. He was only interested in playing in the dirt and water. 

When we take him in the pool at my parents, we put floaties on before he walks out of their house. He has no fear of the water. He'll jump in. He doesn't seem to jump whenever there isn't someone standing there going to catch him but I wouldn't rely on that of course from a 3 year old. 

I don't know if this stuff is just a phase or what. So I'm hoping to get some answers about how to handle him when he gets evaluated.",3
9031,waippe,ObjectiveOne3868,Whata that if you don't mind my asking?,2
9032,waippe,Undrende_fremdeles,"A phase is something that comes and goes, this seems more permanent. Could very likely be that he is on the autism spectrum. It's not just a flat slider from nothing to a lot, but... A spectrum :p Like the full colour spectrum. All sorts of different behaviours may or may not be present.

Smiling when you say things could be as basic as ""I knew that would happen! I get the pattern here! It happened again! I'm understanding cause and effect!!"" and have nothing to do with spite.

Toddlers are very often in a world that makes no sense, and so seeing they can affect the world and have it respond in predictable ways, and they can predict those ways is a common reason for smiling.

Like kids seeing that every time they touch the stereo, parent says ""no"". Kid predicts it, tries touching the stereo (or whatever), parent says ""no"", kid is happy they got it right and will repeat it many times over. That isn't spite, that is a sign of healthy cognitive development.

This is likely very familiar from raising the oldest?

So when you see something is different about this, I believe you.

It is also a human instinct to smile and chuckle when nervous or scared.

I only truly realised when I saw a nature documentary about primates a few years back. They use smiling as a social de-escalation tool. It means they are very uncomfortable and would like for the tension to drop.

They looked exactly like a child or teenager being scolded, and smiling or chuckling while they hold your eyes and look away every so often. Keeping track of the other one's emotional state.

It just suddenly made sense that we do this too! We've taken this social tool much further though, and use it not just a remedy against discomfort, but all the way into showing and enhancing joy.

But apparently we also still have an instinct to do this when uncomfortable.

Could it be he has that type of response?

Because that looks very much like malicious spite if you don't know anything else. But a child that young will very rarely be that kind of evil.

My ex is abusive, and the actual, malignant, malicious spiteful joy they exhibit then is actually somewhat similar to nervous, deeply uncomfortable ""smiling"" visually speaking, though context makes all the difference.

I do hope you'll get more answers as soon as he is seen by specialists. They'll hopefully also know where to point you for more help with his other issues.

You have an older child. Do NOT automatically believe anyone that tells you that ""all kids are different"" as if you don't already know that.

While you can't always make other people understand, you *know* what kids are like. And you have the ""power"" of raising an older child and are aware of how they and their peers vary in development already. 

Believe yourself when you say something else is going on here. I believe you. 

My oldest had a health issue from before she was a month old that wasn't helped until they were 3-4 years old. I said so the whole time. I have younger siblings, I have nieces and nephews, I have helped raise stepchildren from a young age. But I was a mother *myself* for the first time and so my worries were dismissed. Norway, Europe here so not even a case of lack of money or anything as all healthcare is 100% free for pregnancy related issues, and for kids until the age of 18.",2
9033,waippe,pippypup,"Here’s the definition for you from asha.org

Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a neurological childhood (pediatric) speech sound disorder in which the precision and consistency of movements underlying speech are impaired in the absence of neuromuscular deficits (e.g. abnormal reflexes, abnormal tone).",3
9034,waippe,ObjectiveOne3868,"Thank you. I'm happy to be getting him evaluated because as far as I know, he just doesn't want to. But especially if that is the case, then I'll at least be able to get help for him.",2
9035,waippe,catgirl320,"Hi. I work with children with disabilities. Good job on recognizing that he needs an eval. For now, try to let go of the thinking that he doesn't want to or he's doing things on purpose to push your buttons. It's more that he is doing things like smiling because in that moment he's getting your attention and he enjoys that. 

Look up positive behavior techniques. It's basically doing the reverse of what a lot of parents do, which is give more attention to negative behaviors. So you put more of your energy to teaching and reinforcing the behaviors you want. It's a starting point for now until you are able to work with whatever therapists can best support your son. 

You're doing great. You recognized that kiddo might need some extra help and you got the process started. It might take some extra work but it is really rewarding once you see their skills increase.",2
9036,waippe,ObjectiveOne3868,"Thank you so much for the support and kind words. I greatly appreciate your input. I will try that and hopefully that will work better with him. I know every child is different so one way works for one but may not work for the other. I'm looking forward to getting him some help. My other son's speech therapist texted me and said I can put him into headstart. I thought kids had to be potty trained for headstart which is why I wasn't going to.  Kids take a lot of work and patience but every sacrifice we make is worth it all. Like people say, days are long but the years are short.",1

9050,yatpys,bestdays12,"Welcome to the Mom club! Ya done good little duckling! 
Some advice- you will hear about how crying it out is so dangerous…and it is not a great method, but shaken baby syndrome is worse. If you need to there is no shame in changing the diaper, feeding, burping and setting the baby down in their safe space and walking away for a few minutes. Drink some water, wash your face, he’ll sit on the floor and cry beside them. But when you reach your limit, take a breather and go back cool calm and collected. Good Moms know their limits. Learn them now because your limits will be tested from now until eternity… but there’s also so so so much love.  
Dancing them to sleep is better than crying them to sleep. On fussy nights put some music on low and dance baby to sleep. Music you enjoy will inherently help keep you calm and relaxed.

When you get home make yourself a snack station with water and easy snacks near by. Meals might be a daunting task some days. Some nutrition is better than no nutrition. 
Sleep when the baby sleeps is nonsense, but be ok with doing the bare minimum of stuff sometimes. Wash your hair in the sink if you need to. Eat off paper plates. Whatever makes your life easier to free up more time for rest, do it. 

You got this love. You’re going to do great! Xo",12

We are all so proud of you. You’ve taken the world on ur shoulders and had the strength to make it your world. Sending so much love mama, make sure you take care of urself <3

9189,yatpys,ann-kalina,"I absolutely loved this comment. To some, a mother suddenly stops being a human being with weaknesses, flaws or feelings. They have this impossible to reach expectations about how motherhood should be. I mean, my bff got nasty criticism for.. Painting her nails (???.

9193,yatpys,Minimum_Ad6769,"We’re doing good, thanks for asking. Unfortunately it’s not as easy as I thought it would be for the last name, it looks like her dad can claim her as his daughter without me so he can have rights on her and unfortunately he plans on doing so. He wants her to have both last names or he will fill for it.. Her name is Sophia.",2

What a beautiful name!",1
9203,yatpys,Adventurous_Stick_46,"You can also lead him to believe that you gave her both last names and not give her his name. It will at least delay him filing. But I doubt he will file, he is just using the threat to get what he wants",1

9205,yatpys,Anne_Atreptic,Ok. Make sure you rest and don't overwork yourself.,79
9206,yatpys,Minimum_Ad6769,"Even if I don’t give her his last name, he just has to go to the city hall to claim her and have rights on her, maybe he has done it already.. his last name is just for ego but just by claiming her he gots rights on her..",2
9207,yatpys,fatmominalittlecar,Exactly my thought!!  What a lil squishy nugget.  I can smell perfection from here!,17
9208,yatpys,Adventurous_Stick_46,"Well then, in that case definitely don't give her his last name!!!
And even if he does get some rights to her, it won't last long, if you use what he has done against him.",1

9267,v177qc,TheZoomingMonkey,"Not a mom, more of a sister :) 

I work with fine jewelry so I just have some fyi's about your new beauty! 

Colored stones although stunning, are not meant to last on rings. They are not as strong as diamonds, hence why they are not promoted with most everyday wear rings. Don't be surprised if your stones start to lose those sharp facets, crack, or eventually break - it's the natural parts of wearing a colored stone on your hand. You may have to replace some stones over the long years to keep your piece looking fresh and nice! You can help this by *trying* not to sleep with it on or not wearing it while working with your hands. But life is life and rings can always be fixed. Enjoy your new ring, I love that citrine on the side!",2

9319,v177qc,marvin_the_marfan,"the ring came with those colours already originally i got this ring because i am a very rainbow person, but it shows of my lgbtq side as well. then i realized that it has red, purple and blue in it. red is one of my fave colours, so is purple and blue is my partners fave colour. i now i feel even more than ever that it is just meant to be my ring, and he is meant to be my partner. i love him so much, he saw the ring before i did in the shop and new that if i saw it i would i have to have it.",2
9320,v177qc,marvin_the_marfan,"thank you, i really appreciate the advice. we got insurance with the ring and part of it is that they will check it once a year for any issues if they find an issue they will send it off to be fixed plus they clean it up on site so it will be super sparkly when i get it back after inspection.",1

I can’t say enough good things about wearing a tiara, and I’m delighted that you plan to wear yours. 

There may be hiccups on your wedding day, that does sometimes happen what with logistics and all. I encourage you to relax and go with the flow; at the end of that special day, you’ll still be married to the love of your life. 

I second the other mom who wants pictures.",17

As a MfM I have to ask. Have you two discussed and agreed upon important things like finances, children, which way the toilet paper rolls, household duties equally split, and so on? Will you both work or will one stay at home if kids are a part of your future? Would the stay at home parent still have equal say in finances and responsibilities as the one who works? Surprisingly, a lot of people get married without knowing what their partner thinks of these things. Just remember in all situations baby, people tell you who they are. When they do, believe them.

Depression is so much more than just being sad, it can feel like your drowning and just trying to survive some days is exhausting. So the fact that you did the dishes is freaking HUGE. That is such a big deal. 
I've had days where I really wanted to get out of bed and do a small chore but my depression was too much, and even if I wanted to do something the task seemed impossible, so you not only thought of the dishes but you got yourself up and did them, and did them well by the looks of it!

I’m happy for the relief that you must be feeling, because you know I hate seeing you suffer. I wish I could be there for you on your down days, but know that even on the days we don’t see each other in person, I’m always in your heart, & with you in spirit standing right beside rooting you on, or holding your head when you just need to cry, or just sitting quietly with you when you just need to know you’re not alone…I hope this made you feel a little better- and don’t you ever forget that you are worth it, you are loved & you are important… love you, kiddo! Keep on, keeping on!",2
9361,v8ns0z,Caightie2,"Sis, those are big wins and I'm so proud of you. I struggle to get household chores done too, especially when my mental health is declining. 

One person who helped me is [KC Davis](https://www.strugglecare.com/), she teachings that cleanliness is morally neutral and we shouldn't shame or punish ourselves when we struggle to care for ourselves and our living space. 

KC has plenty of tips and tricks to help your house work for you especially during bouts of depression. 

If you scroll down to the bottom of her website, you'll find links to her social media. She's on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok, so you can see her posts on whatever platform you prefer.

""LET WHATEVER YOU DO TODAY BE ENOUGH""

I suffer from debilitating depression & anxiety so I KNOW how it takes control & how life altering it can be but, I'M SO VERY PROUD OF YOU not only for doing the dishes but for pushing through another day!!!

Just a suggestion- Do something for YOU every day like go for a 10-15 minute walk & take in that Vitamin D, watch a funny movie you love, listen to your favorite upbeat songs, volunteer for an animal rescue group (knowing I make a difference in my own small way always lifts my spirits).

I make my bed EVERY SINGLE DAY no matter how much I'm suffering because I've accomplished something. 

You don't know me BUT there are lots of people, myself included that care about you, believe in you, are here for you, have so much empathy for you, wish you all the best, think you're so incredibly brave, are so proud of you, know exactly what you're going through, can relate to ALL of it & love you 💗!!!

If one of my kids was battling depression and they did the dishes or made the bed or got up long enough to take a shower that day, I'd be so proud of them for fighting. It's hard to fight depression because it makes your brain lie to you. My advice: try to do one thing a day. Just one thing. No zero days. Keep up the hard work. You're worth it.

Your birth giver doesn't deserve to be called a mother if she can choose an abuser over her daughter, although it's hard you are so much better of without her in your life. She is the one missing out not you, she is going to miss seeing her wonderful daughter walking down the Isle to become a wife but you aren't missing anything, you are going to have the most amazing day and you will be so busy celebrating with your husband and guests that you won't even think about her.

If you need to give yourself some time on the morning of your wedding day to have a cry and miss he then do so but then you go get married and have your chosen family beside you. 

There is one thing you can thank her for and that is  showing you what not to do as a parent. You will be a great mother if you decide to have children and they will be lucky to have you.

I also wanted to add that I realized at my own wedding, when I had so little people show up for “me”, that my husbands family (his mom & dad are divorced so it was his dads side of the family), sat on “my side” of the church to make it more evened out on both sides, and that even though it was his family, they were also there to support me as well.

It’s nice to know that you can choose, you can put your family first. Your mom picked and she made a terrible mistake, and she will  rue the day she did. But you can live happily, by your own rules, and know that you’ll ALWAYS put your own family first above everything.

Cats can be really great with cuddles and it feels amazing when they lay down on you and purr. Do you know cats would purr to help themselves heal?

This is the family you deserve to have. Their kindness is not a blessing or a favor. This is how you are supposed to be treated. Kindness, understanding, and respect is an unconditional right we are given at birth. They are special people but they are not unsual. 

I had trouble adjusting to this when I finally found a family that was kind to me. So use this as a model of how you should treat others and know that you have always been worthy of this.",3

I am so very happy that you were placed in a good home. I am a social worker that works in child welfare. We have gotten a lot better about weeding out the bad homes from the good ones, but some still slip threw the cracks. 
I'm not sure what your situation is. If your slated for reunification  with your bio-parents or if you're going to be in the system and available for adoption someday... but here is what I would advise. Be honest.  When you can talk to your foster parents, you tell them how very happy you are, all the things you told us, tell them. And let them know that you want to stay in their home for as long as possible. I hope it all works out for you. Keep studying hard, I'm so proud of you!!!",2

I am old, but as a kid I didn’t get things from my parents— they had 6 other kids and it wasn’t too easy back then. Now my husband &kids like to give me gifts, but I recall the empty feeling of not having a “typical” birthday experience with gifts and all that.
You have been blessed with a wonderful foster family. It’s okay if you take time to accept your good fortune. It’s called a blessing. The powers that be have looked on you & said “that child deserves better.”  Now you can choose to pass on any good fortune you can — help others. Go forth and do good. It will make someone else’s life better. Even if it’s a small thing. Compliment someone. Throw some change in a beggar’s cup. Help someone when you see they need it. 🦋♥️🍀♥️🦋

9891,xg9ucl,ShellsFeathersFur,"OP, I'm so happy that you are in a place with good people!

Throwing in my two cents about cats - the absolute best way to make friends with them is to *not touch them* and give them a comfy place to curl up. I look after toddlers and the first thing I do when I start my shift is fold up a blanket for the cat and then invite them to sit on it (pat it while the cat is watching). The cat knows that the blanket is their space and I won't let the toddler near it, so the cat feels safe.

As far as not touching them, every cat has their own preferences. Most cats get overstimulated at some point by being petted and people can be really bad at noticing when that is happening, which is one of the reasons cats go from ""I like this"" to biting to make it stop. So I suggest not petting a cat unless they pet you, like rubbing their cheek against you. And then you can pet their head three times, until you know what the cat likes. If the cat wants more attention, they will ask.

Bottom line, don't go into their space and give them a comfy place to people-watch and they will love you.",25
9892,xg9ucl,noodlepartipoodle,"I am deathly allergic to cats if I touch my face after petting one, and it's ridiculous how they swarm me and jump on me and fight with each other for my attention. I just have to wash my hands really, really well after petting them and then change my clothes and wash those heartily as well. I can testify to the hate-love attraction.",9

I forgot to mention this in the post but my foster mom and her dad go to the farmers market every Saturday to sell stuff and my younger foster sister and I go with them and they let us sell stuff so we make bracelets or soap or candles or lemonade or whatever else we can think of and we split whatever we make. One time we each got $100 after we paid for the supplies. The only downside is we have to leave the house at 5 in the morning but we always stop for donuts and my foster mom makes us coffee on Saturdays. It’s a lot of fun.",14

9900,xg9ucl,DreamCrusher914,"That cat can tell. I bet it would just snuggle you all day if you let it. Cats are quirky.

I had a friend come over once who did not like cats. My cat, a stray that I bottle fed from when she was 2 weeks old so she was what they call a “bottle brat,” sensed he didn’t like cats and proceeded to get comfy on his lap. When she started purring my friend was a bit freaked out. He had never heard a cat purr. I was like, “she’s purring, she likes you!” He sat the rest of the visit petting her head. 

But I get it. My daughter is deathly terrified of dogs, so you should absolutely not have to be around them if you are scared of them.",172

9907,xg9ucl,BrownCatWithAWhite,"Just want to throw in that cats don‘t do this because they want to be an ass. 

Starring at them and being „too much“ is very impolite in a cat’s world. So if you don‘t like cats and avoid them the cat thinks you are just very polite and well behaved lol. Which means they tend to find you sympathetic.

Secondly most cats are really sensible and notice when you are feeling distressed. If they come to you and start purring they might just want to take care of you and calm you down. 

Nevertheless it‘s still completely fine to not like cats and avoid them :)",102

She also used to not like our cats, and would only pet them as they walked away from her (I guess she didn’t like their faces, I don’t know), but now she’s all about our cat (the other cat from my story recently died, she was like 17).

10064,v3cmcm,Toirneach,"Beautiful, darling nibling! That's a daunting thing to do and you did such a nice job!

If it helps, Fake Internets Great-Aunt Toirneach learned a cool idea from TickyTok from DomesticBlisters. There are only 5 categories of STUFF that need to be dealt with when the clutter gets cluttery. Trash, Laundry, Dishes, Things that have a home, Things that don't have a home. Auntie finds it simpler, when she's overwhelmed, to just pick ONE category and do that ONE thing - grab a bag, pick up all the trash. Or sometimes all the trash I have the mental and physical energy to pick up. Is it 'totally clean'? Nope, but it's a hell of a lot better.

Your space looks clean and comfortable and functional for you. That's all a home needs to be, and you did it beautifully.",106
10065,v3cmcm,AggressiveChick,"Not a mom but a sister here and I'm so proud of you!

I've been there and know how it must feel to have your living room back! If you're prone to going back to the old state, that's alright, we all have good and bad days. As a tip, I always pick a day in my week to clean my apartment. Doesn't need to be super thorough, or if you feel like you can't do much, just clean a bit so it doesn't completely go back to its old state. And always take a piece of trash with you whenever you stand up and go somewhere in your apartment, e.g. the bathroom.

So proud of your hard work! <3",51

10158,v3cmcm,CAPTCHA_is_hard,"Nice work! I notice that when my house reaches a certain level of mess I feel overwhelmed and paralyzed by it and it can be hard to even attempt cleaning. But then once you start it can be kind of addictive. And then the end product feels SO GOOD! I think it's true what they say about a cluttered space leading to a cluttered mind. It causes stress if you're surrounded by stuff.

Anyway, I hope you're enjoying your clean space. I think it looks really nice the way you have things arranged! Now is a good time to invite people over when you're proud of how things look! 

Hope you're doing ok. I know that my mess builds up when I'm super busy with life (work, family, issues), OR when I'm super depressed and can't be bothered to move. I want you to know that whatever ails you, don't feel bad if you drop some of the balls you've been juggling. You're human and it's literally not possible to do everything. Just getting through the day is enough. Be kind and patient with yourself. It helps me to think ""if it were my friend, what would I say? Would I be hard on them? No? Then why do that to myself?""",2

It honestly taught me some real life skills (multi tasking, prioritizing, situational awareness, organization, etc) and gave me the confidence to learn to play violin as an adult (if I can heal a raid/bg using muscle memory built around using Grid/Clique and my Razor Naga, surely I can build muscle memory on a stringed instrument too).

10266,rk05xs,MrsJ88,"My mom was a single teen mom, so we had lots of ""bare"" Christmases. One of our traditions was making homemade cards and decorations from her company's used paper (think of the kind printed with the tabbed edges down the sides with perforations) that she would hoard throughout the year. Our gift to each other for many years was privacy with the crayons, scissors, tape, and as much of that paper as we needed to create our gifts. When I was five or six--just old enough to be trusted with those precious scissors--I made my mom a hideous jewelry box. She acted like it was the most amazing thing ever and actually used it, which made me feel like a hero. That crappy ""jewelry box"" still held pride of place on top of her dresser when she passed away. The thing is, I was always so excited to make her something special that it was years before I realized how poor we had been. And her paper gifts to me were priceless treasures. Even after she had earned her degrees and was killing it in her industry, we continued the hand-made paper gift tradition. Trust me, your kids are going to love these stuffies! Way to go!",3
10267,rk05xs,TheRealCeeBeeGee,"Lovely stuffies, very clever! So long as there’s love and laughter the kids won’t mind. Another fun thing they can do with you is cut snowflakes from old newspaper or wrapping off cuts, also use these to make paper chains like we did when I was a kid - lots of fun with safe craft scissors even for quite small kids. And a little treasure hunt (get one of those $2 packs of gold choc coins) , etc etc. when I was small, and my parents were stony broke, my favorite Xmas thing was the mandarin or clementine orange that would be at the very toe of our stockings!",3

Me at my current age 23 would also ABSOLUTELY love that, because I can tell money is right but my mom still put in the time to make me something she thought I’d love (and because it’s a cute toy). 

If your kids are interested in crafting you should have them design clothes or toys for the stuffies and then make them together. My mom used to make me dresses when I was a kid and she’d teach me how to make (really simplified) mini-me dresses and bags for my toys and I loved it. I felt like such a cool grown up hand stitching next to my mom on the sewing machine. We used to use old clothes or buy cheap fabric on sale and use that too so it wasn’t super expensive.",3

Yeah, I know when we were growing up it wasn't necessarily cool to have homemade gifts, but I think that's not necessarily the case nowadays. I think this could lead to something lasting and truly appreciated. 

I don't know if the kids are old enough to start learning how to sew, but for future gifts they can work with you to design clothes/accessories for these little lovies. They'll love being involved & it makes the toys that much more special.",3

10542,z8hvxl,pinktulips8989,"🤩 I was getting ready for dinner once, doing my hair and makeup, and my 4 year old godson was there just hanging out with me playing on the floor. When I was finished, I said “how do I look?!” And he looked at me and said “happy.” You look beautiful; even more-so because you also look super happy.",499
10543,z8hvxl,pieandlatteslover,You look incredible! You rock that dress and look absolutely beautiful. Your inner you shines through and you look happy. I hope you get to enjoy that happiness and have a wonderful night dear!,725
10544,z8hvxl,genderlessadventure,"I’m a trans person, I’ve been in the queer community for over 10 years now so I’d like to think I have a good “trans-dar” and I can honestly say I don’t think you have anything to worry about going out dressed like this. You “pass” extremely well and look absolutely gorgeous! 

Ps. Normally I wouldn’t bring up “passing” or tell someone “I couldn’t even tell” those comments can be taken offensively to trans people, I only said them in this context because OP is worried about their appearance and the potential of going out presenting differently than they usually do. I say them as a reassurance in this context but I wanted to clarify so that well-meaning cis people understand that you generally shouldn’t say those things to trans folks.",1211
10545,z8hvxl,ArbitraryContrarianX,"Hey kiddo,

I honestly don't know what you're worried about, unless it's that you look too much like your old mom.

I mean, I get it, you don't wanna look like me, you wanna be your own person, cool, I respect that, you do you.

But you totally look just like me when I was younger and more daring... Just sayin.

Love,
Mom

PS. How much will you hate me if I randomly show up in the front row of your show and scream ""that's my baby!!!"" at a volume that literally everyone within 5 blocks will hear? Cause that's pretty much already planned and happening, so I hope you won't hate me too much... Just sayin.",158

You pass. Just remember that. If someone is looking at you and you feel uncomfortable, that's just your dysphoria. Accept that you're feeling dysphoric, remember the people looking at you are thinking whatever you want them to think.

If you think you're a fraud, then you'll think they think you're a fraud. If you think you're fierce, then you'll think they're thinking how fierce you are. 

Maybe some people are looking at you positively. Maybe some are looking at you negatively. Either way, until you feel confident and aren't dysphoric, does it really matter? No. It will matter later when you've gotten comfortable being the authentic you.",3

10961,z8hvxl,adventuresinnonsense,You look great! I initially thought you were just showing off your dress! You could get some press on nails with either an almond or stiletto shape to make your fingers/hands look more slender. If you wanted to add a little more force to your waist you could use some light shapewear (you don't have to go as far as a corset). To be honest though all of these are just extra touches that you can do *if* you want to. You look great as-is!,1

11060,z8hvxl,glaciercold,You're gorgeous too,1
11061,z8hvxl,chopstewey,"Hi! Also a woman of trans experience!

The tricky thing when it comes to complimenting someone that's trans by saying stuff like:
-I couldn't even tell you were trans!
-you look better in a dress than *I* do!
-how are you more feminine than me?

Is that those all have a hidden bias behind them that implies that cis is better than trans.

-I couldn't even tell you were trans!
Also says ""if I could tell, that would be worse."" 
-you look better in a dress than *I* do!
Also says ""you're not *supposed* to. Because you're trans."" 
-how are you more feminine than me?
Also says ""I expect y'all to be Mannish brutes.""

Now most of us understand that these things aren't said with the intention of hurting us, but still, that unspoken thing lingers a lot longer than the compliment does. It's just a reflection of the unspoken bias that people still have against us even while supporting us. We're still viewed as lesser, just constantly trying to achieve the ""cisness"" we can never have.

It's much easier to just, like, *compliment us*. Like any other woman. Our shoes or our nails or our eye makeup or whatever. You don't need to make your compliments about how well we're pulling off ""woman"". Because we just *are* women.",768

11104,z8hvxl,autotuned_voicemails,"So two years ago I was in a pretty tough spot in life, I won’t get into it but I wasn’t great. Then I got pregnant, and my parents were…let’s say less than supportive and less than thrilled. I completely cleaned up the moment I found out I was pregnant, but my parents still made my entire pregnancy miserable with their behavior. My daughter will be a year old a week from tomorrow and she is my world. She has only been out of my direct care for like 6 hours total her entire life, and even then she was with my fiancé (her dad). I am a fantastic mom. 

A few weeks ago I was visiting my parents and my dad said to me “you know, I’ve been wanting to say this to you, you’re doing a lot better than I thought you would.” I straight up looked at him and was like “that isn’t *nearly* the compliment you think it is. In fact, I would MUCH rather you have just kept that to yourself.” What he heard was “you’re a good mom”. What I heard was “man, I really thought you were gonna be the shittiest mother in the world (and spent 8 months all but telling you so) but I guess you really aren’t that bad!” So yea, not a compliment and I really do wish he would have just kept that to himself. 

Anyway, OP you look AMAZING! Those legs! (Imagine me putting in like 10 alternating heart & star eye emojis here.) And I lovvvvve peep toes, they’re my favorite shoes to wear!  And that dress is sexy af! I love it all! You’re beautiful and you look so happy and I’m so happy for you!",3

11109,z8hvxl,chopstewey,"""You're all set, buddy."" 

My goodness, the euphoria that comes with even a vaguely gendered term, right? Apologies to the non binary folk that get saddled with a false binary, but there's something so amazing about an unprompted ""this way, ladies"" at a restaurant that sends me. 

>That being said, I would also appreciate being told I pass, even if it is an implication that not passing would be worse. 

There's a lot of trans folk that do appreciate it, and in the times that someone hasn't clocked me, or has expressed shock when learning I'm trans, I admit it can feel good. I DO think, though, that's its an unhealthy goal for trans folk to aspire to, personal safety notwithstanding. It's like self identifying as less valid, for one, and it's also both subjective based on someone else's standards, and simply unattainable for some. The presumed inability to pass has caused so much pain to so many trans siblings, and I wish we all didn't feel forced into a cis standard of acceptable features. 
>feel both happy and sad at once, as it means they think i look masculine but could tell I'm not, if that makes any sense?

That's the crux right there, right? If passing is the goal, you either constantly get hints that you're failing, or you have to out yourself repeatedly to confirm. And if you DO pass, then you're just in another closet where you have to continuously lie about who you are/how you got to where you are.",12
11110,z8hvxl,genderlessadventure,"I too was raised extremely conservative and in what I now know to be a religious cult. My motto is always “we don’t know until we know” because even as a trans person myself I didn’t know any of this until it applied to my life and I learned it. 

There’s a huge difference between willful ignorance/purposely being harmful and just not knowing. Always keep learning to be a better ally but don’t shame yourself for not knowing something you’ve never had the opportunity to learn yet.",3
11111,z8hvxl,chopstewey,"Thank you for doing what you can to support your daughter!

If I had one piece of advice for parents that are trying to be supportive but struggle, it's this: don't let your fear dictate how you support them, because it will show through. They aren't afraid of being trans: rather, they're ecstatic at the possibility of an authentic life. What they're scared of is the societal aversion to trans folk (especially these days). If you show them fear at who they are, rather than excitement at their joy, then you're proving their fear correct.

Embrace her womanhood, include her in yours. Celebrate her truth. She's got the capacity to be happier than you've ever imagined, but she needs to *feel* that you want that for her.

Keep at it, Mom. You've got this.

Edit: a word",7
11112,z8hvxl,chopstewey,"Absolutely. My response was based on the person above me, who was reflecting on something another trans person said to OP.

OP is valid no matter where their journey takes them. No implication meant from me that there's a gender incongruence. Sometimes a dress is too gorgeous not to wear.",6
11113,z8hvxl,Sophiacd11,"The difference for me is that I identify as male and live as male currently. Crossdressing is temporary where at the end of the day, the makeup and clothes come off and I go back to identifying as male. Now transgender is an umbrella term which doesn’t technically mean that someone is transitioning. For me personally, I am considering transition and the best way for me to explore that is to present this way and see how it make me feel. Most people associate the term transgender with people who do transition however and that would be the difference",17

Just to add 2 cents: u/analystnerd, please remember that the goal isn’t for you to say everything perfectly; the goal is to have a relationship where your daughter feels safe enough to give you feedback on your words/actions, and believes that you will proactively take on board her feedback. This is a huge, huge skill for people to learn — how to say “this hurt me because X; please do Y next time.” Aim for creating time & space for those dialogues & that level of trust. It will help her see what healthy relationships should look like, and help her practice advocating for herself in her intimate relationships down the road.",6

Yes, she always looks so happy when I go with her to buy nail polish or when I cut her growing hair into a cute layered style so it looks good while growing out. I still feel like I’m messing up somehow but you’re right, it’s just the fear of society. But she doesn’t care when I’m with her and excited with her. I never realized that was what she needs to most. Seriously, thank you both! This comment had me bawling.",3
11126,z8hvxl,Goth-Llama,"Agreed.

Crossdressing is a fetish one engages in for sexual expression and enjoyment and typically is separate from gender identity.

I've been close with many crossdressers and it's been fun to help them make the transformation in private without the burden of PC social constraints honestly. As someone on the Autistic Spectrum, respecting the rights and feelings of everyone (not just the LGBT+ community) can be a lot to deal with on top of the other things that make me socially awkward, always having to check in and be sure I am aware of, reading, respecting and affirming other's choices, beliefs and identities (we all have many identities in many areas of our lives). It can be exhausting to be social.

This makes me relate to my crossdressing friends in a foundational manner because they are risking a lot to put on a ""face"" and as an Aspie, we often also must mask to fit in and scan people's faces to measure their reactions to know how to respond to everything and so every choice is fraught with uncertainty. I wish the potential consequences weren't such a great risk, otherwise I might view it as exciting rather than anxiety producing.",0
11127,z8hvxl,Goth-Llama,"Excellent breakdown. Non-binary people CAN be transgender but aren't necessarily and vice versa. 

Crossdressing CAN be a vehicle on the way to the journey of a transition but it doesn't have to be.

11225,yjg3t2,Ok_Nebula5568,"Agreed!

(Also, is there actually a universe where floofy toe beans are alarming? If so, that's honestly kind of heartbreaking.)",25
11226,yjg3t2,Kvanantw,"This is really nice to hear. I picked Kay because it was my mom's middle name and the name she would have given me, which I thought was a sweet gesture (despite how my parents are very religious conservatives) but my mom was just mad I was changing it at all. 

And yeah, my judge was really nice too! As a trans person, I always feel like I have to go to new places with my guard up, and it was SUCH a nice surprise that he seemed real happy for me.",36

11230,yjg3t2,Kvanantw,"not even kidding tho, I got another cat (not her, I've had her for a while and she's my best buddy) as a surprise gift like three weeks ago. I am officially cat lady.",7

11235,yjg3t2,Kvanantw,Thanks! I'll go join right now. I can always use more of this in my life.,3
11236,yjg3t2,Kvanantw,"yeah, she had to fight to get on camera too! (it was a video call) She doesn't let me do anything without her, we're thick as thieves. Been through a lot together.",2
11237,yjg3t2,Kvanantw,are you getting the name change anytime soon? it was actually much easier than I expected (although I did have my city's trans foundation guiding me through it). Super fast too! But now I got a lot of phone calls to make to update my name.,2
11238,yjg3t2,Kvanantw,"I'm a girl <3 And thanks! It's a family middle name, and the one member of my blood family I have contact with is my cousin named Lindsey Jeane. She went out of her way to look after me when I got sick, my immediate family left, and I was in a bad way. It just seemed fitting!",2

11242,yjg3t2,Kvanantw,"this made me feel real nice. It's been a process, learning to do makeup the way I want (I have hand tremors, so it's tough sometimes) but I'm getting better. Drawing lessons as a kid helped. Plus, I never left my emo phase so style is real easy <3",1

11246,yjg3t2,EMSthunder,"Reading this comment, I felt compelled to tell you that I’m proud of you for shedding something that doesn’t represent the person you are or want to be. It’s always been interesting that they call it a “family name” when those that are attached to it can be harmful. I hope your day in court is everything you want it to be. When we changed my son’s name it felt magical to free him from the line he towed by carrying that name. I hope your cut to your line is nothing less than empowering. ❤️",2

I don’t have siblings and I don’t have a relationship with any of my family members by choice (though their actions forced me to make that tough decision).

I hear you on the family front. I had to cut communications with all but one family member. I do have a sister biologically, but I haven't been in touch with her for years and whenever I see her from across the street (she lives one town over) I can feel myself start panicking.

11370,tze0av,ArbitraryContrarianX,"Hey, kiddo. I've been there. I don't think I ever told you this, but when I was almost 19, I illegally rented my first apartment for 3 months just to get me through the summer between freshman and sophomore year of college without having to live in my parents' house again.

I shared a one-bedroom apartment with a college friend, and we both slept on air mattresses that were about one inch thick, with a bunch of blankets piled on top of them so we couldn't feel the floor so much. The air mattresses had to be reinflated every couple of days. They were also the closest thing to furniture we had in that house.

Sometimes, having a place that is *yours* where nobody gets to make decisions without you is enough to justify sleeping on the floor.",18

Ask around at work and see if anyone is doing a spring clean and getting rid of stuff.

There is this app called NextDoor that you may want to look into. It’s limited to your immediate neighborhood but there are a lot of people there(depending on the neighborhood) who sell/give away the stuff they don’t need for cheap prices. You have to get verified I think so there are no scammers either. 
If you are so interested, check it out to furnish your apartment for much cheaper cost. It helped my brother out a lot when he got a new place. 

Anyway, a big congrats to you!",3

Furniture is overrated anyways. I've lived on my own for over 12 years and all I have are 4 book shelves, a foldable plant shelf, a kayak in the livingroom, a bedroom side table, a tv stand/cat hammock, and a box spring and mattress on the floor. If you gotta move stuff yourself, it sucks to have a lot of things. But if you want stuff people get rid of nice free stuff all the time. Tables and stuff, might just need cleaning. Congrats on getting free.",2

I’m getting rid of my couch and loveseat this month when I buy my friends couch and loveseat… and my current couch is really comfy to sleep on. When I moved into my first house I slept on the floor for a few weeks then my roommate moved in and brought a couch and I slept on that until I could afford a mattress on the floor. :),2

11425,tze0av,TootsNYC,"That looks so peaceful without any furniture or stuff. When I moved out on my own I told all kinds of people, at work, friends, etc. I remember being so surprised how many people were saying things like “I have a table under my bed that I keep meaning to get rid of. Would you like it? The legs screw on.“ or “my dad is on my case to get my twin bed from college out of his garage. I’ll give it to you if you have any way to drive over to his place and get it.“

11439,tze0av,AmyInCO,"congratulations!. That's awesome. 

You'd be surprised what you can get for free off FB marketplace. My motherly advice would be that if there is one thing worth saving up to get it's a new mattress. You can get the roll up memory foam kind from Amazon for around 200 for a twin. I've seen them for less. And you can get a metal bed frame for about 75. You're going to spend a lot of time in bed and you really don't want a used one! 

Also one good non-stick pot and frying pan. And a knife. All under $25. And Ross has some really good pots and pans for cheap.

Good luck!",2

Should you find yourself needing poutine immediately I’m happy to help as well as provide a safe space for you to rest after having poutine. Feel free to PM me for poutine if you’re in need. We still have many restaurants offering poutine though I’m not sure for how long. If you need to go to Canada to get poutine I’m happy to go with you because I believe everyone should have access to it as well.,3

As per Canadian customs, I can drive you around, wait for you to eat Fries, and provide a bed, Netflix, a cat (who may or may not be hospitable), and snacks while you recover from your Fries. My boyfriend is fluent in English and Dutch and can help you speak to servers or read menus or any other issues you may encounter.

I don't know how much restaurants charge non-residents for Fries here, but I know that all you have to do is walk into a restaurant and state clearly ""it is an emergency and I need Fries."" If you say ""it is an emergency,"" they have to feed you. They don't care why ""it is an emergency"" they just accept your claim that ""it is an emergency"" at face value and feed you, because ""it is an emergency"" and the Dutch understand that emergencies happen

I have experienced different kinds meals here, though not emergency Fries specifically.  The servers and hostesses seated me more quickly than restaurants in other countries, and the head chef made my food instead of the dishwasher. 10/10 service. Absolutely recommend.

Some of us can handle the consequences. Some of us ARE willing to risk lawsuit. Some of us are even lawyers. The reality is that the majority of people who are offering food will never actually have someone from out of state on their couch to get food. But these posts do have value outside of that. 

First, it serves as encouragement for those living out of state that there ARE options and there ARE people who care. If all these abortion networks are so silent, how the fuck are people supposed to find them? 

2) it’s a reminder for everyone in our own circles that our homes are safe spaces for them if they need this type of food.

*May the love of this man and this woman, their unity of spirit, grow deeper and stronger in the uncertainties and changes of life they will share.*

*Loving each other, may they love all persons. Trusting each other, may they learn to trust life.*

*May their love reach out to the love of all, that their lives may bless all whose lives they touch. May they find comfort together in shared hours of shadow, as well as in the bright sunshine of joy. May they be to each other both strong and gentle.*

*May all who follow their lives with interest and affection have cause to rejoice not alone in their happiness, but in their brave and generous living which makes life beautiful and significant.*",232

As in, do they know who wrote / spoke it, or was it some ""official"" blessing, etc.   It doesn't seem to have any direct religious references so it doesn't seem likely to be a traditional religious blessing.   I was just curious to know more as I am unfamiliar with any Irish traditions and really liked this quote.",13

Make sure you get a baby toothbrush and gently clean it every night with some hand soap and air dry, so it gets the residues off that could tarnish it and keep it sparkly. Also, shake it next to your ear about once a month, and if anything rattles, go take it in to get the prongs reset.",2

Sending you hugs. It’s hard to not share your loved ones with the ones who have gone before us. I suspect you’ll feel some pangs of grief as you go through planning, but maybe grief shows the presence of love without the physical presence of the person. Anyways, congratulations!",2

Your forever mother is incredibly proud too. She’s always near. Always listen to your intuition. It’s not only your subconscious, it’s  also your mother, the one that gave birth to you and her mother and so on. No matter your ups and downs you’ve, she’s the one that knows you best and loves you most. Listen. 

You’ll have a host of ancestral angels with you on your wedding day, and your mother right there with you, as always.

Congratulations beloved.",2

12060,udvu27,ohgodnonotthesun,"Congratulations!  That ring is stunning! Enjoy being engaged and don't get caught up in minute wedding details that don't really matter.  Be flexible and laugh about anything that doesn't go as planned, it makes for great stories later on!  We were raided by the police and a dozen other things went awry.  I still get told years later how fun it was.",1
12061,udvu27,WhySoManyOstriches,That ring is just as gorgeous as the hand it’s on. I am so happy for you!! PS- If you want to do Thanksgiving or Xmas at his parents- No worries! Let’s just either have lunch before you leave or do a “Kings Night” dinner when you get home so I can hear all about it! I bet they’re lovely!,1

Let me say this is one of those key moments a mom would think to and wish for her daughter.  I'm so happy you are fulfilling it.  Now don't forget about us when uts time for the dress shopping  😉",16
12066,udvu27,bellYllub,"Congratulations! I’m so happy for you! Your ring is stunning!

My engagement ring is similarly shaped and just in case you don’t know, search for a “wishbone” wedding ring. It will fit around your engagement ring instead of butting awkwardly against it!

I’m so ridiculously happy for you! I hope your marriage is all you could wish for! Lots of love and hugs! xxxx",11
12067,ufkhr3,Liseyloop123,Sorry for your loss 💜,249
12068,ufkhr3,themommesthingever,"Oh sweetheart, I’m so sorry. It must be so hard to loose both parents. Big mom sized hugs from me 💜",238
12069,ufkhr3,X23-22,"I doubt I’m old enough to be your mom, but I just want you to know you are infinitely loved and supported. Anything you may be feeling right now in response to him dying is completely valid, and please for me, do a kindness to yourself and let yourself feel those things. The pain may never go away, and the loss unforgettable, but one day you will be able to remember him past the pain you felt when he died and will be able to look back on your favorite moments together and a happiness will accompany your grief. I don’t know what religion you are, but regardless i hope you find comfort in the fact that it is proven that energy never dies. At this very moment the energy that gave your father life is giving itself to all corners of the universe as you read this. One day you too will be a part of that universe, as will your mom no matter where she is now. One day you will all be together again",201
12070,ufkhr3,eatitwithaspoon,"that's a very kind way to put it.  very well stated. 💜

i'm so sorry your dad died.  you must be missing him fiercely, and worried about your mom on top of that.  this is a lot to bear.  do you have people around you?",63
12071,ufkhr3,marlipaige,"I’m so sorry. That’s heartbreaking. My aunt and uncle were divorced for over a decade before she died. On her death bed he told her he never loved anyone else. Neither of them dated anyone until after she died. I think people assume if you aren’t together, it’s because you don’t love one another.  But that’s not always the case.",51
12072,ufkhr3,somuchyarn10,"I'm so sorry for your loss,  may his memory be a blessing.",34
12073,ufkhr3,LibertarianHottie,That is a wonderful picture of you with him! I pray for you to be able to cherish the time you had together,24
12074,ufkhr3,denimuprising,Oh baby... I'm so sorry. I'm thinking of you and I know it doesn't help right now and I know you wish someone would just wrap you in a big mum hug and I promise I wish I could wrap you in that big mum hug and make it all feel better for a little bit.,13
12075,ufkhr3,curiouslyinclined,"Sending you all the support and love to help you through this difficult time.  Please remember to take care of yourself, eat and hydrate. Take care of your emotional and mental well-being too. I say this because ot was very hard for me to get out of the sadness fog when my mom passed.  I think your mom appreciates all that you did for your dad, even if she doesn't know yet.",11
12076,ufkhr3,georgepordgie,I'm so sorry. you done the right thing for him.,8
12077,ufkhr3,MamaSaurusCat,"As I've recently seen a similar thing happen close to me, this is quite emotional to read/see. I am so sorry. I wish I knew what to say, or how to help. I hope it doesn't offend you, but I'll pray for y'all tonight, for me it feels like the best I can offer aside from an internet hug of encouragement. It will be okay eventually, just hold on.

Edit:  Misspelling",8
12078,ufkhr3,ArbitraryContrarianX,"Hey kiddo,

I'm so sorry that we haven't been able to talk since I was deported, but I'm SO HAPPY that you got to stay in the country I chose for us. I know the situation isn't the best but at least you get to stay somewhere that you have a better chance, and that's what I wanted for you.

As for your dad, of course we were significant to each other, we gave each other you. More than anything, I'm sorry you're alone now. If I can't be with you, there's no one I'd rather you be with than your dad, and I'm so sorry for you that he's gone now too. But you are strong, and you'll make it work.

I wish you didn't have to be so strong, but I know you'll do your best, and you'll have the best opportunities where you are.

Love,
Mom

12092,ufkhr3,pleasemakemelol,I hope you are surrounded by people that you love and feel safe with. I’m so sorry and can be an available ear if ever you need one - I can relate in a couple ways. Let yourself feel everything now and take care of yourself.,3
12093,ufkhr3,CatCoughDrop,"I'm deeply sorry for your loss. I lost dad recently too and it's devastating. Mom and dad weren't together but we were always family. She visited the hospital with me when allowed and near the end he asked if she could help him shave instead of the nurses. 

I can't imagine losing both parents. While it's unfair, you're so strong. Lean on the people you have around you and be patient with yourself.",3

12104,ufkhr3,Gabby1410,"Hey pumpkin. I know things are tough right now, but you have this handled. Think of him often, remember everything he did, good or bad. Honour him for the real man that he was, and laugh about the silly things he did. That is how you will get through this. 

I am so sorry I can't be there. But you know that I am always with you. We both are there in everything that you do, and who you are. 

Remember how proud we are, and will be, of the things you do and will do in the future.",1

This sub shows family is more than blood and marriage - it is the people with whom you share love and support and kindness and happiness",5

I didn't get to say goodbye. I really wish I could have shown him an act of love like that before he passed.",4

12116,ufkhr3,marlipaige,"Even though they’d been divorced before she passed, on the “weddings before my own” memory table, I had my aunt and uncle’s wedding commemorated. They were still a couple who had a great bearing on my life and relationships. Just because they couldn’t live together didn’t mean they didn’t still love one another and raise a child together. 

She was a sweet, kind person. They just grew into very different people. And they fought. Living apart they got along great. They didn’t fight about little stupid things. They raised their daughter.",5

You don’t need to make up these arbitrary rules for yourself. There aren’t any rules.

When I realized this… it made it a little easier to get things done.

I would skip breakfast altogether because I didn’t want breakfast food. Screw it, nobody is gonna arrest me for eating pizza rolls at 6am instead of breakfast food. Especially when the alternative was that I eat nothing.

I didn’t have the energy to do laundry, dry, sort, fold, hang, put away…. Soon I realized that I could throw all the clothes in my hamper after drying and drape them over something at home instead of getting stressed about putting them away. 

Too depressed to even shower? Sitting on the shower floor worked just fine. Dishes? Get disposable plates and silverware. Not any energy to prepare food? Get stuff you don’t have to prepare. You can only sleep at odd hours? Fine. Sleep at odd hours then.

It wasn't until I was in my mid 20's, diagnosed with fibromyalgia, that I started to understand that I was doing more harm than good.

Make sure you're drinking lots of water!!

You're probably going to get so, so much unsolicited advice in the next few months, but if there is one thing to take to heart, please keep hydrated. Your body needs it more than ever, it's very hot right now, and I promise it's the one piece of advice that will not be bad no matter the circumstance of your pregnancy.

The fear of rejection stopped me from living as my true self for nearly ten years before I did anything about it. It’s scary as hell, but like you said, I know you can do it! <3

After the offer, we met in person and she finally remembered me (lol!) and my kind words years ago. We kind of bonded after that and I still hold deep respect for her in multiple regards.

You are allowed to only come out where it is safe, or where you will be celebrated, or never! or for any reason at all that is good enough for you. 

If you want, do something that connects you to the real you, like wearing under garments or a pin that only you can see, so that you have a tangible reminder of the truth. 

But you aren’t being hypocritical or betraying yourself if you aren’t out everywhere. Environments and people who are not safe have forfeited the right to be told the truth.",121

12649,vxeq3s,SockStinkQueen,"Question; why buzz your head? 

If it's to wear a wig, you don't need to. If it's to grow your hair out, just grow it out. 
When you use a decent wig cap (it's like a tight hair net) with your wig you don't need to cut your hair. 

Mine is shoulder length and I wear a wig cap and wig no problem. Is it easier with less hair? Probably but I'm not noticing much. 

As for ""good quality"", I advise just buying some cheap but good reviewed ones on Amazon. You can find a good* wig on Amazon for $15 (short wigs) to $25 (long wigs). Yes, there are more expensive ones as well. 

I mean, if you have a plan of action, don't think I'm trying to argue with you. I just find it easier for me to have a bunch of wigs in various colors and styles rather than one ""forever"" wig. ❤️



*looks nice, 'hair' realistic like rather than plastic looking, easy enough to brush and style.",29

But also, when you share something you made, it improves the world. It inspires others. It prompts more beauty and more creation. It soothes and comforts others. It lifts.

It's your highest, most pure self that is reaching out. There is not much in the world that is more important.

Keep creating. Keep painting. Keep summoning the courage to share what you create, knowing that it sends kind and inspiring ripples throughout the world. What you do *matters* -- much more than you think. Keep doing what you know to be right and good. And know that you are loved.",3

I was terrified, but since I'm in the middle of a continent, I have a hard time getting near any body of water with jellyfish in it. They intrigue and terrify me even today, but this drawing is so lovely. (ok, painting? My eyes are old). 

Thank you for checking in. I'm happy that you've had better times to keep you going and didn't need to check in so much, even though this week is a crapper. 

I really identified with the middle child in the Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day book that I read when my kids were little. (Maybe you know it?) Even after all the bad stuff happens to Alexander, and it's not just one bad day either, he says something like ""Some days are just like that, even in Australia"" (where he'd like to escape to). I hope you are feeling that feeling tonight. That some days are just like that but not all of them will be.

Yes,I’m guess the oceans and seas are like tears—even salty. 

I think jelly fish are beautiful creatures too—and such a bad reputation! I’ve never been stung once. The way the move and propel themselves in the sea is fascinating. 

Sea life is all so beautiful. I wish we’d all globally agree to take better care of the seas. That’s where life on this planet began, if I recall correctly. We do live on the Water Planet, and tears can be very healing. That’s what your psinting and your words made me remember. (I cried a lot this past week too. I miss my daughter.)",2

12810,xip3lg,RugelBeta,"Big hugs. If what follows is too much, ignore it. As a mom and grandma, I sometimes tend to go on and on...  ;)

 I had a mom when I was younger, but not a dad, and I had been much closer to my dad. Mom was overwhelmed and that made her cruel and she took terrible risks. I won't ever get over the dysfunction entirely, but there are some things that definitely helped. 

One was taping positive notes \*everywhere\*. Any place I knew I would see them. My desktop computer looked like it had fringe, there were so many scribbled Post-it notes taped to its edges. I taped encouraging notes to the bathroom mirror. When someone said something kind to me in email or online I printed it out and saved it in a Smile File. Sometimes I took out a few sentences and printed those separately in big, bold font and taped it up. 

It was all proof I wasn't a total fuck-up. That someone, somewhere believed in me.

The other big thing I did was to find my group. People who understood, at least somewhat, where I had been and where I was trying to get to. People who were trying to put good out into the world. People who gave me a chance because they didn't know me -- this was the early days of the internet -- and who helped inspire me and helped me do my best.

Some days that group and those affirmative notes were all I had. If you had asked the people around me they might have been surprised at how dark my thoughts were. But none of us really knows how rough our fellow humans have it, right? 

In my case I was hanging out with artists. My whole life, I had only known a couple other artists. This group was amazing. Their inspiration, resources, and encouragement helped to put my writing and art together. I summoned the courage to share what I created. Then I made books. Eventually the books sold. I could walk into a library or bookstore on the other side of the country (in some cases, in other countries...) and my books were there. People who I didn't know bought my work. It was AMAZING. It reminded me I had ideas worth sharing and the future was going to be better than the past.

A third thing helped: Through my artist friends I figured out I had ADHD. I was in my 40s... It suddenly gave me a framework for understanding my own dysfunction. I wasn't a bad person. I was just different from my mother and her expectations and the rules of the corporate world.

How are you different from the people around you? Maybe that is your strength. Maybe that is something to concentrate on and work with in a creative way. Maybe it pulls you up -- but it also pulls up others because you had the courage to try first.

We each have a different path. I don't know where your path has gone or where it will go, but I know this: None of us deserves to feel unloved. None of us was born to feel small and disposable. We all have strengths and abilities that can lift us, but that can also lift others.

If you can, get a doctor, therapist, advisor, old teacher, \*someone\* who can help guide you and help you make sense of the rough times. Sometimes just a few people's wisdom pieced together can explain a lot of what has been missing.

You are not alone. <3",2
12811,xip3lg,warkifiedchocobo,"-hugs- what happened? You don't have to answer, btw... I don't want to upset you, but i will give you a hug. Sea life is amazing. Do you have Netflix? There's a show on Netflix called Moving Art - there's 3 episodes that focus just on the sea - they're just tons of nature footage set to calm meditation music, no narrative. It's definitely a go to when I need to just feel feelings in a safe place. The ocean... water in general its the most peaceful and humbling... it is in my opinion the most purest vision of life and like going back to beginning.",2

&#x200B;

Daughter started college! I miss her, but she is on her own life adventure, that's all. I'm a passionate advocate of the philiospical stance that parents do not own their children--some behave like that--and I just want that sweet girl to have a happy life (and remember dear ole Ma every so often, of course ; )

&#x200B;

I also cried about some sadness that had been bottled up until I had time. Having a good cry can be very healing.

&#x200B;

Thank again so much for the netflix recommendation. I will check it out. But you'll promise to keep painting too? Of course you will, my love! And if you need to have a good cry, let the ocean tide out \[of your eyes\]. Water is one of the  most powerful forces on this planet. xoxo be well sweetheart.",2

My mom saw me as property and did very wrong things, so it's really nice to be reminded there are parents like you out there who encourage their children to be their own people. I hope letting out those tears has been soothing for you! I'll keep painting, just have had a rough time of many things lately, but I painted today so that's progress right? ❤️ thank you for your kindness and support, it means more than you know.",2

If one of these did not bring tears to your eyes or give you an inner thrill, then you haven't  found your dress yet. If all three did, the last consideration is comfort of movement.

I remember when I was trying on wedding dresses. I tried on about twenty, and then, I put **the one** on. I got overwhelmed and started crying, which surprised me because I am normally pretty unemotional, and I'm not one to care about clothes. That's how I knew which dress to get.",3
12880,r9vdbx,big_red__man,"Not a mom. I'm a guy that enjoys this sub for all the outpouring of love that it gives. My wife knows that I've cried more times than I'd like to admit because of things that I've read here. I don't ever comment here because I'm not a mom and it isn't my place to do so. This is an exception.

I used to be a banquet manager at a fancy-pants hotel and I've been in charge of more than 100 wedding receptions. I've seen a lot of things but there's one consistent thing that I tell everyone I know who is getting married. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE TIME TO EAT. It's going to be a long day. It's going to be a blur. Friends and family will all want to personally tell you how beautiful you are, congratulations, and maybe hand you an envelope of cash. You are going to receive so much love. It's going to be amazing. But make sure you eat.

I don't know the number of times that I've sent the staff out to clear plates and the bride and groom's plates haven't been touched. So we leave them and an hour later they still haven't been touched. The bride and groom are receiving so much love and attention and feel like its impolite to set up boundaries so they can eat the food that they spent so much time picking out. My advice is to have bridesmaids or groomsmen run point on it and deflect the well wishers for the 20 minutes that it takes to eat a plate of food.

It's important to eat on such an active, long day.

12881,r9vdbx,hackulator,"The first one looks amazing from the back but honestly from the front it I'm not a fan. You look great but the part around your arms seems off from the front.  I personally like the second one the best because I'm a fan of the satin finish and I don't love how you can see where your slips end in the back of the third one. To be clear I'm nit picking to give you an answer, you look great in all of them.",3
12882,r9vdbx,reeseinpeaces,"Oh my Ducking, you’re so beautiful!!  They all look fabulous on you!  The lacy one has lovely texture, and the satiny one has wonderful lines. You will be a beautiful bride in any of these. Best wishes and all the love.",3
12883,r9vdbx,jamsterella,"Congratulations!!
You’ll look beautiful in any one of these dresses.
Stunning 🤩",2
12884,r9vdbx,Fluffy-Designer,Either 2 or 3. The first one makes you look very square and does nothing for your amazing figure. You glow in the second one but the third flatters your figure the most.,2
12885,r9vdbx,Magnus826,I love the lace one!,2
12886,r9vdbx,LadyDpool,"I vote #1 or #3. The silk one looks like it fits all static-clingy, but there other two look like they did your body better. I love the elegance of the first, and the casual feel of the second.

12913,r9vdbx,GhostfaceKiliz,"Hey sis, to help pic out the dress...

Visualize your wedding day:

Your spouse to be is standing at the end of the aisle, and sees you at the other end.
Their smile grows larger and they start to tear up, seeing you coming closer.
You look gorgeous, and are feeling the most beautiful you've ever felt, walking to your beloved.

You glance down, to make sure you don't trip...

Now, picture what dress you're wearing and feel the best, and most beautiful in.

Pick that dress you see in your vision.


...now I want to know what one you chose. 😊",2

12921,r9vdbx,E_Francis,When is your wedding? I work in the bridal industry and all three dresses are absolutely stunning but each lends itself to a different season in my mind. My favorite of the three is the first one because I’ve seen thousands of bridal gowns but have never seen one like that! It’s breathtaking on you!,2

12931,r9vdbx,elitost,"oh my gosh they are all stunning on you! my favorites are 1 and 2. number 1 was my initial reaction with the unique neckline, but number 2 has gorgeous draping and makes you shine with the silk. i think I vote for number 2, but you look gorgeous in all of them. congrats! xo",2
12932,r9vdbx,justbrowzingthru,"You look great in all.  Can pull off all.

#2 has the Carolyn  Bessett Kennedy vibe. She wore a very similar dress.",2
12933,r9vdbx,PearlGoldfish46,"Not a mom but a sister, the second looks amazing on you!! The silk looks sooooo beautiful on you and makes you look like a princess. Plus the back of it shapes you very well. But no matter what dress you choose you’ll look perfect!",2

You are an amazing woman and I am so proud of you, my beautiful daughter. I wish every happiness for you.",2
12941,r9vdbx,catbymoonlight,I loveeee the second one! It's absolutely stunning and is a stand out dress! I really like the third one as well but I feel like you see this style more often. The first one doesn't look as comfortable to wear because of the restricted arm movement but I also feel it doesn't flatter your beautiful figure line the other two dresses.,2
12942,r9vdbx,psychicamnesia,"I love the 3rd on you, but really you should pick ghe one that you can see yourself in on your wedding. Imagine yourself there and pick the one that feels right. Congrats on your wedding hun!!!!",2

12944,r9vdbx,edgar_allan,"Hey sis, I love the first one because I love the look of the smooth silhouette with the dramatic off-shoulder; I also like the lace detail on the third one. Ultimately it's whatever you feel COMFORTABLE and HAPPY in!",2

12953,r9vdbx,absolutelymassiverat,"The second one suits you beautifully, I love it!!",2
12954,r9vdbx,BirdSnotBreakfast,Number 3 fits you so well and you look immaculate in that lace. It accentuates your figure while still being simple and flowing. It is a beautiful dress and makes you absolutely glow!,2
12955,r9vdbx,grmrsan,"All gorgeous,  but I'm  torn between first and last, they are both amazing. I think the lace one is stunning on you, but the first one is more elegant. The satin one is pretty, but it doesn't  lay quite right on you.",2

Of course, you look amazing in them all! You can't go wrong.",2
12962,r9vdbx,realistby,Number 2 and 3.,2
12963,r9vdbx,Kitsuneka,I really like the feel you give off with the first dress and the cut is wonderful on you. But choose the one you feel like wonderwoman in because this day will be amazing and you can handle anything and will feel like it. You will look amazing in any of these so ho with your heart.,2
12964,r9vdbx,neverenoughpurple,"I love the second and third the best. They're similar yet so different that it's really your personal preference. 

The first, you look fantastic in - don't get me wrong, you're one of the few who can pull off that style - but to me, it just isn't as wonderful as the other two.",2
12965,r9vdbx,laurdshoe,"3 stunning dresses and one STUNNER of a bride! You literally cannot go wrong! 
My vote though goes to #2….VERY Jacquelyn Bisset when she married JFK Jr. That wedding was long ago, but her dress was so elegant in it’s simplicity…and with the veil and the details on the back? I’ve never seen that kind of back before! 
PS…My girlfriend had a gorgeous lace dress. It was soft lace, but by the end of the evening, her arms were pretty irritated underneath from rubbing on it. 

Squeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!  I’m so excited for you!! Please keep us posted! 
So much love,

You are absolutely stunning!",2

12992,r9vdbx,-poiu-,"The second one, just based on the limited photos, seems to flatter you the most so I’d go with number 2. But each one is gorgeous and you look amazing in all three so if one of the others looks better or you like it better, go with it.

Edit: just saw you’re having a small wedding. So, I still definitely think number 2 because if you ever choose to, you could have it altered to make it wearable at another special occasion; vowel renewal, christening or whatever your traditions are.",2

13030,r9vdbx,The_Majestic_Dodo,"Oh my goodness- they’re all gorgeous. I really love the first one, you look positively regal!",2
13031,r9vdbx,freeingthesoul,"All the dresses are incredible, but as a veteran watcher of ""What Not to Wear"", I would go with the second one.  The higher waist lengthens your legs and does the most justice to your silhouette.  The first one has a lower waist, which shortens your legs and doesn't show your natural proportions.  The third dress is gorgeous, but it almost seems like you're swimming in lace.  It's a little too much for your frame.  Sounds like your intuition is leading you to the right one!",2
13032,r9vdbx,ivfmumma_tryme,"Wow you look amazing I love them all 

I would personally choose 2 but you go with what you want",2
13033,r9vdbx,berrybleach,"Number 2 looks sooooooo good on you 😭 you’re the bride of dreams! Number 3 is maybe more classic and I agree with the other commenters- the lace is stunning! But ultimately I like n. 2 better, I think it compliments your figure perfectly and it’s an unique style. 

Which is your favourite?
Wishing you all the love and happiness in the world 🤍",2

13083,r9vdbx,wifelost,You look stunning in all three and your joy is simply radiating.

13121,r9vdbx,littlebitofspice,"Love them all!  Don't just think about the ceremony though, think about the entire day.  Will you be comfortable in one more than another while dancing, eating, etc.?

You'll be stunning no matter which one you pick, but in my experience, being comfortable at the end of a long day is something to consider.

Congratulations to you!

EtA:. Do something fun like walk around the park or go out to dinner all dressed up (just read that you're having a small civil ceremony).  It's so much fun to have random people congratulate you and tell you how wonderful you look.  Source: Husband and I were married in Vegas and had a blast walking around all dressed up.",2

13129,r9vdbx,AmazingRise,"The silky one, definitely",2
13130,r9vdbx,honest-miss,"Okay, so, rule #1: No telling a bride which to pick! Instead, I'm going to ask you:

\- Which one gave you happy wiggles and dances? Because that's the one that you're excited and having fun in.

\- When you imagine your photos, what kind of dress do you see in them? When you imagine dancing that night, which one can you see grooving and shaking in (dancing, I mean dancing :P) all night long? Which dress do you see your partner looking at as you walk down the aisle?

\- For a lot of people, this is the first and only Very, Very Formal dress they'll ever buy for themselves. Is it important to you that the dress be uniquely formal (something you'll never find off-rack under any circumstances)? If it is, pick the dress that lets you best live the fanciest day of your life in the fanciest duds of your life.

And a few practical considerations:

\- How much does it matter if someone will have to help you do things like pee? If the answer is ""a lot. That sounds horrible"" then go for whichever dress you can best manage on your own.

\- You have a few off-the-shoulder options: One thing to consider is how much you want to worry about your tater tots unexpectedly putting on a show. That's not to say it's likely to happen (these things are tailored to an inch of their life), but if you're a worrier it'll keep you distracted. And no one wants to worry about that stuff all night long.

\- Check the underarms. Are your arms rubbing on any kind of beaded or lace material? That can cause a lot of irritation through the day, so keep that in mind if it's something you don't want to deal with.",2
13131,r9vdbx,IolaBoylen,I like number one! Classy but also very chic,2
13132,r9vdbx,Bitter-Safe2910,Second for sure!!! it’s so unique.,2

13134,r9vdbx,Miscellaniac,"Hey sweetie! I remember trying on my wedding dress and the moment I saw it on I knew. It's such a special day

I personally would go with #3. The lace over lay is so so so pretty, and its such a classic bridal look that it would fit any sort of theme or not theme you might have. Also, your face is beaming in #3. The other two pictures you look kind of like you're picking produce at the store. Go with 3! 

Congratulations also on your big big day!",2
13135,r9vdbx,sumthingsumthingblah,"You could wear a potato sack and still be the most beautiful bride I have ever seen. I loved them all, though I think it’s between #2 and #3. But it’s your day. Which one makes you feel the most like a bride?",2

If i had to choose one anyways, I'd go with first.
It just.. fits perfectly.

Second doesn't really feel like you, that's the feeling it gives.

Third is really nice too, I like it, but doesn't give the ""THIS IS THE ONE"" vibes like the first.
Although your smile is the best in the third, my opinion aside maybe you should choose that one, after all you will wear it! :)


Regardless which one you choose, I'm happy for you, and wish you all the best in life! :)",2
13139,r9vdbx,KT_mama,"You should choose whichever one makes you feel like the best, most confident version of yourself. 

Personally, I like option 1. But that's because I always choose the cleanest (visually), sleekest look and I think the top of that one gives such classic, understated drama to the dress. All 3 look wonderful on you though so any of them would be a stunning choice.",2

13204,r9vdbx,nixiedust,Definitely 2. All 3 are nice but 2 fits you the best and is elegant and sexy. 1 puts all the focus on your shoulders and chest; 3 puts all the focus on the rear. 2 is just right!,2
13205,r9vdbx,nonsenseimsure,The 3rd one,2
13206,r9vdbx,SilverAnd_Cold,The last one looks amazing on you!,2
13207,r9vdbx,Saiomi,"You look wonderful in all of your dresses! Radiant! Which dress let's you dance the most comfortably? Which one is comfortable when you sit down? Which one is the dress that is going to let you enjoy your day with your husband, worry-free? That is the dress I would want you to have. All of those dresses are stunning on you, no question about that, but you're only going to be standing still and looking your best (like you were in the mirror) for some of the time. The rest of your day will be filled with movement, hugs, sitting and standing, getting dipped, dancing, and all sorts of movement. Get the dress that lets you move without worry. Get the dress that lets you give the best hugs!",2
13208,r9vdbx,UnicornBoned,The last one is my favorite. You look lovely.,2

13243,r9vdbx,maraskywhiner,"You’re gorgeous in all of them, but that third dress looks like it was made for you! You also seem much more at ease in it compared to the others.

At the end of the day though, wear what makes you feel the best, no matter what others say. I was married in sea green despite lots of family drama for my choice, and I still look back fondly on my wedding dress because it made me feel beautiful. All I want is for you to have the same feelings about your dress in 15-20 years.",2
13244,r9vdbx,Photomama16,You look absolutely beautiful in all 3. You are going to make a stunning bride! Which of the dresses do you feel the best in? That is the one that I would encourage you to choose.,2
13245,r9vdbx,desgoestoparis,"I adored the train on the second one! The neckline on that one isn’t my favorite, but you pulled it off beautifully!",2
13246,r9vdbx,emi_delaguerra,"Oh honey, they are all beautiful, just like you!

I like the first one best because of the button details, but all of them stunning, and any would be an excellent choice.",2
13247,r9vdbx,Sarfush,"Wow. You have the figure to pull any of these off, but have to agree no 3 is beautiful. Pretty and on the right side of sexy. Lace is a lovely design so balanced traditional with modern. 
I’d go dress shopping somewhere else and then come back and see how it feels to get back in to the dress. If you don’t want to take it off, it’s the one. 
Congratulations you will be the most stunning bride. I wish you much love and laughter in your life with your partner.",2
13248,r9vdbx,KimKarTRASHian09,All of them you look stunning in :),2

13251,r9vdbx,dolie55,#3,2
13252,r9vdbx,gardenofholliess,I'm probably bias because it looks very similar to the dress I wore to my ceremony but I say number 2!! I loved it when I wore it because it was so comfortable but still felt very romantic and glamorous.,2
13253,r9vdbx,CurrentSubstance,The second one looks beautiful on you. You look most elegant in that one.,2
13254,r9vdbx,bumfeldonia,Your face in the last one makes me think that's it.,2

13256,r9vdbx,bornkorn,Silk!!,2
13257,r9vdbx,whosgayisthis,I personally love the third dress. It enhances your figure and we can see your face looking at the dress. You look excited and immensely happy. You would look beautiful in any of them but I especially love the lace train,2
13258,r9vdbx,butterfly_guts,"It really depends on what theme you and your partner want. If you’re going for something more chic and formal, go for the first one. The second one is fun, sexy, and goes great with a more upbeat, dancing kind of energy. The third one is the best for a cozy, modest theme. It’s all up to you, darling! You look stunning no matter what you wear :) ❤️",2
13259,r9vdbx,9d9banangelas,Ok. Number 2 or number 3. You look stunning in them all!!! Congratulations!,2
13260,r9vdbx,Sewciopath17,3 is my favorite,2
13261,r9vdbx,corgi_freak,"All are lovely, but I prefer #2 by just a bit. You'd rock any of them though. 😁",2
13262,r9vdbx,kanguskong1,"All of these gowns fit you amazingly and seem as though they were designed for you by the designers!!! 
All of them are extremely lovely , I wish you could wear all three. 
Number two is sticking out so much to me , you look fabulous in all  three.",2
13263,r9vdbx,kn1ght1sh,"Hi! I think they all look great! My gf who has much more taste than I do says 1 seems more formal wedding while 2 and 3 seem slightly less so (not in a bad way!). I personally think 1 looks nicest. She agrees, with two as a second choice. She also thinks you look happiest in the first one, but only you can know that for sure!",2
13264,r9vdbx,okayisgood,Oh my god sis you look AMAZING!!! As someone that worked in bridal for two years I always longed for the brides I work with check them selves out the way you are in that 3rd picture. All three dresses are stunning and the smile you have in two and three is exactly the kind reaction you want. You can’t go wrong here but that second dress had you feeling some type of way and it shows! 🔥🙌🏻👰🏻‍♀️,2
13265,r9vdbx,Kimmicooka1114,"You are a beautiful bride! My personal favorite is number 2. I think it's the most flattering and the back is stunning. But whatever you choose my dear, you will be a gorgeous bride!",2

13273,r9vdbx,Bf56831747,"Speaking as a sister, you look phenomenal in all of em (that’s not helpful I know lol)",2
13274,r9vdbx,eliebellie," I LOVE #1 and # 2!  Need more pics! But as others have said, it's the one that makes YOU feel the best!",2
13275,r9vdbx,Kashmir2020Alex,I love the first one!!!,2
13276,r9vdbx,Minty-Hoe,the first one is stunning and unique but it's all up to how you feel in each dress and what you're going for,2

13278,r9vdbx,xandera007,"I think you look amazing in both 2 and 3.  My personal favorite is 2, but only because I'm not a fan of lace.  But the lace looked amazing on you, and if it felt right, then go for it.",2
13279,r9vdbx,vivahermione,"Another vote for number 3. You look stunning! Also, those lace roses are just beautiful. Congratulations, sis! 🤗",2
13280,r9vdbx,ColeeeB,"The first one is very classy-elegant. It is Stunning.
The back, more so than the front.
The 2nd one is very pretty - soft... more romantic... and the back with the veil is just Beautiful & lovely.
The third one is pretty...  but unless You feel like it is the dress — I would choose between 1 or 2.
Do you want more classy? Or... Romantic with a little sexy...?
You are absolutely gorgeous in all three, so, my dear, you CANNOT go wrong.
Which one do YOU feel the best and most comfortable in??  ❤️💖❤️",2
13281,r9vdbx,vkapadia,"I'm terrible at choosing, but all three are gorgeous!",2
13282,r9vdbx,soneg,"#3 for sure. On #1, the material looks too heavy and makes you look like you have no boobs. #2 style is nice but the material doesn't look as nice. #3 looks like it was made for you.",2
13283,r9vdbx,Tannaheta,"The texture of the third dress is my favourite, although all three are gorgeous. It'll come down to which one makes you feel the most comfortable.",2
13284,r9vdbx,mayat7,"You are so lovely in them all! Pick the one that makes you zing! with joy. In the photos, your delighted face in the lace dress suggests that's the one... Is it?",2

13297,r9vdbx,InitialShame8283,"Thank you!! Yes, I’m glad you picked up on them having distinctly different feelings. I’m very open to different styles and wanted to try many different vibes out. My fiancé and I are having a small City Hall ceremony so I kind of felt like the second one made the most sense because it’s unique and comfortable, while also not being too over the top. It’s interesting you talk about being brought to tears because I thought I would be for sure, but I wasn’t. I want to say it’s because my mom wasn’t there. But I’m not sure. Thank you so much for your support Auntie J 🤍🥰",110

13309,r9vdbx,InitialShame8283,"That’s true about the restriction in the arms. Although I will say, we’re having a small City Hall ceremony so I won’t have to worry about a crazy reception. I always thought I’d have a super planned out wedding but since parting ways with my family have come to realize I much prefer a ceremony that’s more about my fiancé and I. But I will still be planning plenty!! Lol thank you so much!!",75
13310,r9vdbx,InitialShame8283,Thank you!! 🤍🤍,20

I’m in a few wedding subreddits, so I’ve seen many people post about their City Hall weddings. Some people wear casual white dresses, some don’t bother with a wedding dress at all, and some wear dramatic over-the-top ball gowns! The decision really is up to you.",32

13358,r9vdbx,gingersnappie,I love the second one.  It has a very very classic look that is absolutely timeless.  They are all gorgeous and you are stunning!  Congratulations on your marriage and best wishes <3,2

13360,r9vdbx,PizzaCat625,"I came here to say the same thing! Love the old Hollywood vibes, and I feel like silk or silk-like materials have been really in style as of late. But, as everyone else stated before me, you look absolutely breathtaking in all 3 dresses!",4

13369,r9vdbx,nashamagirl99,That’s the answer then! Choose the second one.,12
13370,r9vdbx,dorothy_zbornak_esq,It’s mine too! You’re going to be a beautiful bride :) I wish you and your intended many happy years together,5

13373,r9vdbx,DominarBuckwheat,"I actually said ""good god"" in my head, this is *the* dress!",3
13374,r9vdbx,dot-zip,Was honestly surprised how far down I had to scroll to see votes for #2! Definitely my favorite both in material and silhouette. Congrats OP!!,3
13375,r9vdbx,the_cockodile_hunter,Agreed! It also looks the most comfortable and that's usually a big priority for me when dress shopping. ❤️ congratulations!!,2
13376,r9vdbx,XaciousT,"I love the lace in the third one like so many others, but it was number 2 that I like the best. You are beautiful, and it is a gorgeous dress. Unfortunately, we don't see your face in the pictures wearing that one to see what your reaction might be to it. Go with the one that makes your soul sing though.",9
13377,r9vdbx,yashqasw,"op, if you think the second one makes you feel the best, that's the dress for you!",4
13378,r9vdbx,brainonvacation78,"Ok then I'm giving you new advice: if you're doing a small ceremony and no reception, wear whichever one makes you feel like you'll never get the chance to wear a dress like that again. But, I do think the 2nd dress looks banging just a percentage more over the others but my 2nd pic (if function isn't a concern) is the 1st one. But you wear all 3 beautifully. Your fiance is lucky.",52
13379,r9vdbx,snpods,"If you want to hug any tall people, the sleeves on #1 will make that a challenge.  Whether it’s your groom or a good friend, just beware!  Signed, a 5’3” former bride with a 6’2” spouse",2

You’re going to be a gorgeous bride. Congratulations!",11
13381,r9vdbx,queefer_sutherland92,"The first one looked AHHHMAZING, and it’s not my style at all. There’s not many people in the world that could pull it off either — gotta have shoulders like yours. Truly stunning!!",3
13382,r9vdbx,sweetpotatopietime,"You look beautiful in all of them, but the 1st is least flattering to your figure. #2 and #3 are amazing though. Best wishes xoxo!!",1
13383,r9vdbx,FunkyMonkeyIsObvious,Of course! ❤️❤️❤️,3
13384,r9vdbx,Bawonga,"The second dress has a 1930s vibe, very chic, with beautiful flow and draping of the fabric! It reminds me a little of the wedding dress in the 1934 film, [*It Happened One Night*.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wedding+scene+in+It+Happened+One+Night&t=osx&iax=images&ia=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vogue.com%2Fphotos%2F5877409e71b368a625a0b658%2Fmaster%2Fw_400%252Cc_limit%2F13-it-happened-one-night.jpg) (without the veil)",13

13387,r9vdbx,yellowscarvesnodots,I think that’s your answer!  The advice that helped me most when picking a dress was: Which would you pick if your wedding was tomorrow? Somehow it helped me chose the dress that made me feel the best in my own skin if that makes sense.,3
13388,r9vdbx,JustCallMeBubbles,There you go! It’s gorgeous and so are you!!!,4

So happy for you and your wedding!",2
13391,r9vdbx,E_Francis,Fall is perfect and that’s the season I had in mind for that dress! Congratulations! You’re going to be a lovely bride.,2
13392,r9vdbx,laurdshoe,"Oh you so remind me of her in that dress. She was absolutely gorgeous, and you are no less beautiful! However, while you remind me of her in those pics, you truly do take every one of those dresses and put your own stamp on it.

13397,r9vdbx,TheOrigRayofSunshine,"I liked the first the best as well, but maybe I like the style more. The diagonal stitching in the front of number 2 gave me ocd. I’m not a huge fan of 3, but that seems to be on trend. 

1 seemed the most “timeless” to me.",5

13399,r9vdbx,TenMoon,"I'm going to piggyback on this comment to let OP consider some kind of reception in the future. If the couple decides to throw themselves a party, the second dress looks like it would be the easiest to dance in and would fit into the widest variety of venues.",9

Marriage is a slumber party with your best friend, and it just keeps going. 

You'll have hard times, but remember to say yes more than you say no, to think of three things you appreciate about your spouse every time you think about something that frustrates you, to never stop thinking of little ways to make each other happy, and to care more about being kind than about being right.",44

13411,xwiku8,_Volly,"My wife is a Jew. I'm an atheist. Been married 24 years. She is beside me as I type this. My brother didn't come to my wedding for he is a Christian minister and had ""issue"" with my wife and I. My retort was to tell him to fuck off. It is HIS choice to be offended. Again - His choice. I'm NOT responsible for his choices. He is. So, he can fuck off seeing how he doesn't like it. I couldn't care less. 

What I will say about you two is this: You need nobody's approval but your own when you get married. You are not hurting anyone, each of you are with who you love, and that is all that matters. 

Don't let anyone get between you two. What you two have is special and that is a wonderful thing.",9

The actual line is ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb,"" meaning the people you choose to be a part of your life are more important than those forced upon you.

A little wedding day advice from Grammy Rita: ""Eat. The. Food. You paid for the food, make sure you make time to eat it! It'll settle your nerves to have something solid in your stomach.""

Now some from your brother here:

A crochet hook can help if you have an outfit with small buttons. 
Do a bathroom trial run. Know how to extract yourself from your outfit before it's an emergency.  
Throw a small sewing kit in the bathroom at your venue. It'll save someone the embarrassment of a broken outfit.
Pack comfy socks and shoes for the next day. Your feet are probably gonna hurt from being on them all day. 
Have someone in your party with a granola bar or some nuts for you. If you're feeling headachy or crabby stop and have a bite. Same with water. 
Don't feel ""obligated"" to invite anybody. It's your day. Do what makes you happy. 

I could go on and on but you get the jist. Take care.",2
13434,xwiku8,steffie-flies,"u/Suspicious-Ganache93 Congratulations!

My advice is that rarely will the relationship ever be 50/50. Somedays it's 75/25, 60/40, even 100/0. 

Take it one day at a time, and on the days you can't make it through the day, take it an hour at a time, or even 60 seconds at a time. 

Remember it's always you and your spouse vs. a problem! 

Sometimes the solutions to issues won't come immediately, and you can't reach a neat and tidy compromise, but pick the choice that causes the least amount of damage to the partnership. 

And lastly, make sure to keep working on your friendship as a married couple. Keep your quirks and what makes you unique and make sure to celebrate those things about yourselves. Couples that can laugh together will last together. Good luck you two! ❤️",2

If I may offer some advice, I highly recommend premarital counselling. A lot of people think ""we don't have problems, why get premarital counselling?"" 
But it's not about fixing problems, it's about making sure you're both on the same page about everything, even things you might not have thought of, so there are less problems later in life (all marriages have problems, that's just life). I'm so glad hubby and I did it and I wish more people did.

All the best for your wedding and future. Love Mum.",1

Now, I don't know the next thing about relationships or marriage, and I don't really have as much lived experience as a lot of the people here, but here's what I think. I think that if you two really love each other and want to take this step, then go for it and don't pay too much mind to anyone who disagrees.

Unfortunately, some people don't know how to ""love"" without conditions and a lot of times it's because that's how they grew up. I'm sorry that y'all are dealing with unsupportive people, but don't let it steal your joy. Just know that love is a wonderful thing and that exciting things are in your future!

You wedding is your wedding. Don't let anyone force you to do anything or invite people that don't add to the joy of the day. That being said, the wedding day is just one day. Expect some disasters and roll with it.

50/50 doesn't work nearly as well as 100/100. Both partners should give more than 50%.

You will have days that even though you love each other you won't like each other very much. This will pass.

Having some separate hobbies, interests, friends, alone time is healthy!

13541,xwiku8,DrAbsintheDirge,"How exciting!  Isn't it great to learn about a different culture from a dearly loved one?  You look so happy.  It makes me feel all warm and gooey inside.  My dear children, remember apologized easily and often.  Things we do and say in moments of frustration and confusion can hurt our partners.  Sometimes the way we see situations can differ greatly from them.  

If we see that we've hurt them, it can be easy to get rooted in the feeling that, ""I didn't do anything wrong.""  Defensiveness isn't helpful.  You may feel that, and that is human and okay. 

But think a bit about the fact that the one you love was hurt or angered.  You are not responsible for their feelings, but you should care about their pain.  And you both should want to explore how you communicate, and what is behind the taking of offense/feeling of defensiveness.  Your different experiences have gotten you to this moment.  Learning about how that history has shaped your hidden wounds together will help you grow together.  

Congratulations and best wishes.",1

Since they speak both French and English, but primarily English, she told me once that they use the more formal word for you (vous) rather than the less formal (tu). Why? She told me that it’s because her grandmother had told her that one should always speak to one’s spouses as though that spouse is a just little bit better than oneself. 

I love that. So you can sort of “fight” over which of you is better, and maybe it’ll work for you like it did for my old friends.",2

13646,wv0wt5,Youre_ARealJerk,"You know what’s something that brings me absolute pure joy? Those moments when my son is 100% being himself. When he’s engrossed in something he finds interesting. When he’s SO excited about something he can’t get his words out. When he’s dressed up as Spider-Man and truly feeling like a hero for a moment. I often have moments that trigger the thought “that few seconds was the REAL (kids name) shining through. I wish everyone else in the world knew (kids name) the way I know him” and feeling like I know him and can see the real him shine through each day brings me so much joy. 

And this picture gave me those same mom feelings - you’re being 100% you in this brief moment and as a mom it makes me so purely happy to get to witness it - to witness YOU. 

This pic is a few hours old already, so I hope you had an amazing day! ♥️",2

I'm glad my daughter and my mom had each other to share fashionista stuff with though...bc they were both disappointed with my lack of interest in the whole thing...lol

I appreciate beauty, and respect other people's interest in makeup, clothes etc...it just really hasn't been my jam since like high school, and I'm cool with that ;) 
That was the only brief stage in my life when I had any interest in fashion/makeup at all (it was probably peer pressure...lol) So my mom was disappointed when I was little bc I hated being dressed up like a doll...and my daughter was disappointed later on bc I was useless with fashion insight or makeup skills, though I happily bought her all of the girly clothes and accessories, nail polish, makeup etc that she wanted when she expressed her interest 💜

That's a great attitude overall though...that it's never too late to learn and grow to achieve your goals and dreams! 🌸💖🌸",1

13965,wqsvwi,Tired-a55-momma,"I don’t know if you ever watched Doctor Who. But my absolute favorite episode is called Vincent and the Doctor. They go back in time and meet Vincent Van Gogh. Later, they talk to the curator of a museum. They ask him where Van Gogh rates in the history of art, and his quote has always spoken so strongly to my heart. 

“Well... um... big question, but, to me Van Gogh is the finest painter of them all. Certainly the most popular, great painter of all time. The most beloved, his command of colour most magnificent. He transformed the pain of his tormented life into ecstatic beauty. Pain is easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world, no one had ever done it before. Perhaps no one ever will again. To my mind, that strange, wild man who roamed the fields of Provence was not only the world's greatest artist, but also one of the greatest men who ever lived”

I’m a patron of a group called the Feminist Sticker Club. Every month they choose an artistic contribution that focuses on women’s issues and print it on a sticker for their patrons, I’ve received some beautiful artwork on stickers from them. This is the type of artwork they prioritize, if you feel so inclined you may want to submit your work. Sending you all the good energy and joy to fill your heart, you deserve it and more ❤️",3

I'm sorry for everything you've been through sweetie, but look what you created from that pain, proof you're stronger and should be proud of yourself.",2
14042,wqsvwi,MatchaMatchsticks,You should talk to a gallery or other place locally for maybe a small collection? Something to consider as a therapy or way of release! Maybe Collab with other artists?,2

14045,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,Thank you so much 🥹,24

14047,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"That means so much to me, thank you.",40
14048,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"Wow, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. That's absolutely horrible, nobody deserves to feel like she feels. I hope you have found peace, too. ❤️

I was 13. And it was 13 years ago now. I was groomed and raped by a man for about 6 months. Part of me thought it would never stop, I kept silent for 9 years. Now I've been in therapy for many years, the healing never ends, but making this piece has changed me. 

I'm glad I could evoke some emotions for you. All I want is to help people, however I can. 🙏 Xoxo",22
14049,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"Thank you so much. Bahaha the hand looking like shit was not on purpose but I definitely connect to that meaning! Love it. 

The mouth missing was for 9 years of silence. I was only a child. The pink aura is my childlike spirit, dwindling away. There's so much in this piece that has meaning to me, I'm so glad everyone is able to see the meanings too. 

It's been 13 years now, tons of therapy, and I've never been better. Thank you for your well wishes ❤️",22
14050,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"Thank you so much. It has been 13 years since the assault, I was only a child. I have been in therapy for many many years now, working on finding the right medication too. I'm doing MUCH better than I ever have before. Finally healing. Much love to you as well, thank you for everything you do xoxo",7
14051,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"Thank you so much. I'm glad you can see the feelings, I just wanted others to be able to connect to it too!",2
14052,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"I'm so sorry you had to deal with this too. No one should have this burden. 

I mostly wanted to share it here because my sister told me many people would be able to relate to it. I think that's very true, and if I can help or inspire other people's healing, that would help my healing too. Gotta spread that love.",3
14053,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"Wow, thank you so much 😭 I just don't want anyone else to feel this way. Hearing all the other stories just breaks my heart, but we will rise up, and create things unimaginable. I wouldn't be who I am today if it wasn't for my past. ❤️",3
14054,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"So glad you could connect with it. Sharing the healing vibes with you, sib 🙏",3
14055,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"That's a great idea! I do love working with clay. Thank you so much, I'm so sorry you had to go through what you did. We don't deserve it. ❤️",3
14056,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"I actually wanted it to look provocative in a sexual way at first glance. Then you realize a young girl is being assaulted. Her pink aura (childlike spirit) dwindling away as she sleeps bound to her adult captor. I think I'll call it ""groomed"". 

So thank you, that's exactly how I wanted it to come out ❤️",8
14057,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,I love you too!! You guys are all the best. I'm so overwhelmed with support 😭❤️,3

14063,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"Thank you so much ❤️ if someone is willing to steal it, that means it meant something to them. As long as I can evoke emotions and inspire others with this piece, I don't care much who shares it. Unless I can sue them for a lot of money, in that case, I'm comin for ya 😈",3
14064,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,Thank you so much friend 🥹,2

14066,wqsvwi,IdPreferNotT0,"Very cathartic!! I couldn't even handle all the emotions coming up, very empowering. It's been 13 years since the assault, and I've been in therapy a long time, but this was something that no amount of therapy could help with. I always want hugs, so thank you so much ❤️",1

14083,wqsvwi,human_chew_toy,"You can say you're not an artist all you want, but you created something beautiful from a painful life experience. If you look at any artist, you'll find the same. You are just as valid as they are, even if you don't have a huge backlog of work.",23

You have expressed yourself quite beautifully and I hope that you continue to use this creative outlet, and to develop your skills moving forward. You have a natural talent and it would be a shame not to use it. I also know that it was intimidating to share your work for the first time, but look at all that you have accomplished. I’m so proud of you! Please share your future work. Moms love to watch people grow and develop.",8
14087,wqsvwi,Syntherion,"I think what you just described is I’m fact what makes you an artist. You may never paint again, but your explanation makes me think this isn’t the last time we’ll hear from you",3
14088,wqsvwi,jbeezcrazy,What are you talking about? Of course you’re an artist. Your painting is incredible . I got the meaning immediately. Not many people are to express what their thinking artistically. Two thumbs up!,3
14089,wqsvwi,LindaBitz,You’re wrong. You are definitely an artist.,2
14090,wqsvwi,greatballsofmeow,If you make art then you’re an artist! You don’t have to be Picasso for it to count.,2

14092,wqsvwi,NoVaFlipFlops,"You're welcome. Your mom would be proud, too. I'm a mom so I think I should know.",7
14093,wqsvwi,PenelopeAliWatson,"Thank you ❤️ I'm sorry you endured that, I'm glad you broke free. You are brave. You're also brave for allowing your mind to create this piece of powerful art. 

I'm doing better now. I was 16 at the time, I'll be 31 soon. I have an amazingly compassionate husband who has helped me heal. I go to therapy weekly and really push myself out of my comfort zone. 

I express myself through art, too. I sew and paint / sketch. My latest [piece](https://imgur.com/a/P9MHhj9) is about how great it felt to get my hair washed at the salon. It's the first time I'd enjoyed anything like that (relaxing and giving control to a stranger without freaking out inside) in years. I came home and created it a week or so ago. 

Hearing others stories of survival brings me hope. May we both keep healing 🌻❤️",17
14094,wqsvwi,,yes I noticed the pink cloud and it seemed hopeful - in some guided meditation they say to imagine yourself in pink (and/or green) light for healing.,3

You and i strongly resemble each other in profile, to the extent that this photo was kindof jarring. Now i just want to go try on dresses. My man warned me that he'll wear a tux if... and only if... he can rip the sleeves off. I do so wish my own mama was still here to field that condition. Hilarity would ensue.

You mentioned a NDE the comments.  Can you share what you saw?

If you don't want to, or it's traumatic or upsets you, absolutely do **not** feel obligated to reply.  The reason that I'm inordinately curious - I know one other person who had a NDE in a car accident.  Her main takeaway was that she was very calm and in zero pain from the 11 shoulder surgeries she'd endured up to that day.  As someone who is in chronic pain every single day of my life, that was...a welcome thing to hear, if that makes sense.  Again, no requirement to answer!",3

Of course it has affected you!! That is only natural and I hope that you have someone you trust that you can talk about that with. Your old honourary Mum here has died a few times myself when I was a teenager and then almost again last year. It DOES change you. 

You decide if it changes you for the better or for the worse. You can choose to live a grateful and full life or be too scared to take any risks or chances. I hope and trust you have chosen the former! I know I did! (Or at least somewhere in the middle!)

I’m so proud of how hard you fought to recover!! 

It wasn’t your time, you still had (and have) work to do here. You have so many who love you and are so glad you not only survived but thrived.
I’m so proud of you.
Love,
Mum 

PS I know you know this but lemme remind you just for my own peace of mind

♥️drive safely

🧡wear your seatbelt, yes even around to the corner store! YOU are PRECIOUS cargo!

💛don’t use your phone when you are driving (yes even at stop lights!) 

💚make sure you are clear headed and alert when you drive (no drinking/drugging when driving)

💙 don’t drive if you are upset/angry

💜 watch for pedestrians!

14284,u6bey1,lillyringlet,"As a fellow TBI sufferer check out the community, there is one on Reddit and they are very welcoming. It's a common thing to have issues with mental health, especially with certain brain injuries causing damage to parts of the brain dealing with emotion. 

I've found learning a new language is helping which is crazy. Not sure why but I'm finding it is helping with my emotions. I've heard others learnt an instrument or dived into learning to paint. 

Therapy though is great if you can talk to someone who specializes in brain injury patients. If not try an art therapist. It is really good apparently as it can help you work through things emotionally but also even if the verbal pathways are damaged.",6

14311,xv0s3w,JoMamma_80,"You both look amazing! Such a beautiful couple 🤍 

I’m so happy for you. 

I have a few bits of advice- I’ve been married for almost 19 years (together 25+) to my best friend since I was 15. 

It’s ok to go to bed mad! We always say I love you even if we’re angry, but sometimes it’s healthier to get a good night sleep, eat a healthy breakfast, get a cup of coffee, and *then* hash it out. It’s ok to take some time and space and come back when you know you can handle it. 

Marriage isn’t 50/50. It should be 100/100 with both giving your all the best that you can. Sometimes it will be 80/20 or 60/40- love and support the other and give extra when it’s needed. As long as you both do this, you’ll not get burned out 🤍🤍

Don’t forget to continue to date and have fun! 

I’m so so happy for you!",5

We definitely have to work on letting ourselves sleep if serious conversations happen into the night, but we both very much believe in the ever shifting divisions of support, and we’ve both been in both positions of giving and receiving.

Your parents are doing your brother a disservice as much as you by not expecting much from him. This type of favoritism makes it very hard for the children child to function as an adult independent of parents. In a weird way, they almost did you a favor. 

Remember you are an independent woman and can choose how much contact you want with your family. As your internet mom, I'm very proud of you",131

Build yourself a ♥️family of the heart♥️. They will be the support system and cheerleaders your sperm & blood sharing family is not.

You have done exceptionally well, and you take that money, and you save it, and as others have said, protect it from outsiders. It is yours, and yours alone. You earned it. 

Although I am lucky because my family is not like this, I also come from a culture where the males are treated like kings, and the girls are secondary. But let me tell you this; you are second best to NO ONE. You are amazing, and wonderful, and you never need to feel anything different.

And THEN to get such an impressive raise so early in your career? Wow! I'm doing a happy dance here in Alabama for you and your future! You are amazing and deserving of love and respect! 

I saw where you said you moving out would be a sign you're earning more money. 

I don't know much about real estate but may I suggest talking with your bank about the best accounts to save for a DOWN PAYMENT and what to expect from mortgage payments/insurance. That way you can plan your escape (bc, let's be honest, you're escaping a toxic life) and do it safely and relatively financially easy.


Please transfer all accounts to a bank where your parents do NOT have an account. I've read entirely too many stories about parents talking with the tellers and stealing ALL their child's money.

For all the reasons you posted and many more, you should make it a point to NOT discuss your income with your family or friends. It can only cause problems. If you make too little, you will be thought of as poor and pitied or looked down on. If you make too much, they will accuse you of being stuck up, not earning it honestly, or start asking you for money and expect you to pay because you are ""rich"".

They’ll also love a break from listening to Christine always bragging about her grandson Todd. The kid passed summer school. He didn’t cure cancer, Christine! 
I know you have always been careful with money, but I want you to make sure you buy yourself one nice thing! You worked hard for it and you deserve it. Do NOT feel guilty about it!

The world recognizes your hard work and skill.,2
14513,wu7dr2,Sofa_Queen,"Congratulations!  This mama is incredibly proud of you!

If you don't have a financial advisor, get one.  Preferably in a different town so loose lips don't get your salary told to your family.

If they ever ask you what you make, just sigh and say ""not enough"".  If they press you, just tell them an amount 1/4 of what you actually make.  *Just because they're family doesn't mean they are owed anything, including your salary.*

Now go life a happy life, put as much money away for retirement/vacations/fun stuff as you can.  Remember:  you don't owe anyone a cent just because they're family.",2

I would recommend you keep some in a savings account nobody knows about so you can have a down payment for your own place to live. You can then gradually go LC or NC. Nobody is entitled to your time, energy, love or money. 
If possible, dont get any bank statements sent to your family home.Sad as it is, I dont trust them. They clearly don't respect you.

The location is extremely sentimental to me because my grandparents, who have since passed, used to take me on vacation there as a kid. I'm BEYOND proud of my fiance because of all the thought he put into making it the best day of my life. I didn't include it in the pics but he also bought me a custom ring box with my name engraved and a custom sweatshirt that says ""Future Mrs. Warner""!!! Those special touches just elevated everything! He's amazing. <3",1

14844,w2qr6d,No_Lobster4141,Amazing advice! We try to practice all of those already in our relationship! I’m hoping to never stop. 🥰,6
14845,w2qr6d,bellYllub,"CONGRATULATIONS!!!! 🫶🏻 

I’ve been married for 12 years and my husband and I have been to hell and back multiple times! (I have a genetic disorder and have been so close to dying, so many times, that Doctors told my husband to plan my funeral on more than one occasion!)

From the time I started dating as a teen, my Mum drilled into me “If he doesn’t make you laugh out loud at least once a day, don’t stay with him!”

Even at our lowest moments, when it felt like the whole world was against us, we stood side by side and we found a way to laugh. Sometimes that even means laughing through tears!

Never stay with a man that doesn’t make you happy, you beautiful lady, he should be able to make you laugh, even during your darkest hours together.

Laughter really is the best medicine! My husband has me in fits of giggles multiple times every day and I know we can face any bad situation with humour! 

Happiness is the whole point of marriage in today’s world. If you’re not happy, it’s not worth it.

You will have those tears for sure, but if you can make each other laugh through them, you’ll be solid as a rock!

These pictures though, they make my heart swell. I know you can take on life together, you’re clearly made for each other. All I wish for you is that your marriage is as happy, healthy and secure as mine! I’m stupidly happy for you!!!! ❤️❤️❤️",4

We both wanted to say thank you so much for the advice and well wishes! He constantly makes me laugh even in the worse situations. I know that even as we get old and gray that he will still have his gorgeous blue eyes and amazing sense of humor. What more could I ask for in a life partner? I’ve never been more happy than when I’m with him. Never. 

We wish the best for you and your husband! What an incredible story and example of true love and loyalty! I hope you continue to make eachother as happy as you were when you first met. 💛",4

14860,w2qr6d,bellYllub,"Oh sweetheart, you made me cry too!!

You’re both so welcome and as I’m sure many others have said, you’re always welcome to come back here to share your happiness, your fears, your doubts and your tears, both of you! We want to know it all!!

Life won’t always be easy but these beautiful pictures tell a story of true love and a deep bond. If you stand shoulder to shoulder through it all, you’ll make it through anything life throws at the two of you!

I’m so glad that you can make each other laugh like that though, it really is the secret to a bloody amazing relationship!

Keep laughing, keep loving and *always* keep talking! Everything you face, if you face it together, you’ll be unbreakable. You may argue, you may not always know what to do in every situation but if you can talk about anything that crops up then you can figure it out between you in a way that leaves you both happy!

I’m proud of you both and crying tears of joy! Loving each other the way you do is special. My husband is still the most handsome man I’ve ever laid eyes on, even after many years together! It makes me so happy to hear your words, you clearly love each other deeply and I’m so happy for you both, I could burst!

I wish I could come and hug you both, you’re amazing!!

My story is special, I would not be alive without my husband fighting for me every step of the way!! I wish you both that same unbreakable bond for the rest of your lives.

All the love, hugs and kisses to you both! If ever you’re having a bad day… look back at these photos and remind yourselves what you’re battling for! You’re amazing, both of you. Again, CONGRATULATIONS!! I couldn’t be happier for you! ❤️❤️❤️",3

Youre better at this than i am. My take on makeup is black and dim and gothic and really bad. Seriously babe, you should see how gross my racoon eyes from the 90s and early 2000s go on my pale ass face.

Keep up the good work. Maybe one day soon you can give me a few pointers!!",1

My tip: the best time to experiment and practice with makeup is just before bed because you’re gonna wipe it all off anyway and no one is there to see you so there’s no pressure",1
15055,w9j0po,LunaLynnTheCellist,"Oh hey sis, it looks great gj! If I can drop one piece of potential advice, it would be maybe have the red cover more of the eyelid so it looks a bit more natural? Although you know me, I have like no experience, take it with a grain of salt🤷‍♀️",1

15065,w9j0po,Maleficent_Memory_60, Brow gel sounds good . My go to brow thing is a brow pencil. My eyebrow has some thinker spots and some thicker spots so i just pencil in where i want it to look fuller and that's it.  I have thick eyebrows. I once used a pencil and filled in my whole eyebrow i was looking at my eyebrow up close and not from a distance and when I looked at my eyebrows from a normal distance they looked so thick like Groucho thickness. :( They looked like look big giant black caterpillars. :( But not i know that is not the way for me. I think if i used the brow gel it might look the same for me.,3
15066,w9j0po,NefariousnessOk8037,I'm still learning at 33 and I use an old drag hack. Elmer's glue stick.  One pass over each brow and follow it with some eyeshadow.  Works magic.  I typically tint my brows to match my hair but I have also done rainbow and glitter!,2

She’s a lucky little girl and I bet she feels like a princess.",215
15255,vfzh85,desert_dame,"Wonderful job. Old time sewer here. Now for the finishing touch. Steam press the bodice. Use paper lining between iron and fabric. Don’t use shots of steam. Practice first so you don’t get pooling water or water drops on fabric. It will set the fabric, make the hemlines around the arms and neck uniform get rid of  the puckers in the neckline.  A nice crisp finish. 

Steam pressing with paper is a secret weapon with sewing.   I wouldn’t press the skirt. That’s more tricky. 

It’s a lovely project and one to be proud of.",102

15313,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,"Thank you 🥹 I had this sewing machine for almost 3 years now and couldn’t complete even one project. The lines were always wonky, I’d get easily discouraged. My last project turned out okay, but too small. It devastated me to be honest. I decided to try one last time before selling the machine. And it worked!",119
15314,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,"Thank you!!! I appreciate every one of your advices. I actually made a mistake with the hemlines around the neck and armholes, I had to cut into it like 3-4 times in order to be able to fold it properly without it being wonky due to it being circular. Now it kind of looks weird. I can PM you, maybe you can let me know what I can do to fix it.",32
15315,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,Ohhh I sure hope so!!! It’s a sign for me to keep it. Thank you very much for your kind words❤️,12
15316,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,"I’m honestly not talented at all. I’m the most average person ever. Everything I do is “alright”. I always wanted to do something for my children, something I never had when I was a kid. And I felt like sewing was the most bonding experience with my babies. I so far only have a daughter, and she’s going to be my little mannequin 😅

15323,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,Honestly it’s just easier to do it on babies since their waist and chest are literally the same size 😃 thank you very much 🥰❤️,3
15324,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,"I promise, if I get better at this I’ll make one for you and send it to you!",3
15325,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,Thank you so much! I’m honestly impressed that I didn’t set the whole desk on fire and didn’t sew my own finger onto the fabric. 🫠,1
15326,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,"Trust me, even though it’s frustrating and hard at times, YouTube helps a bunch. I have ADHD, it’s really difficult to concentrate and comprehend visuals like that, but if I can, you definitely can too! Somewhere deep inside of you there’s a talented seamstress waiting to be noticed ❤️❤️❤️",3
15327,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,"Thank you! Please, I’m just a very very beginner. It’s all YouTube and a thousand mistakes. If I can, anyone can too!",3
15328,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,Thank you very much 🌸,1
15329,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,"Would you believe if I said there wasn’t one? I measured my daughters armholes, chest and back, length and waistline and just drafted a basic bodice pattern. In the back pattern I just drew a straight line from the shoulder line down to the spine leaving around half an inch of seam allowance. When I cut the bodice I just snipped it in the middle to be able to overlap the back panels at the bottom making them look more sleek. The skirt is a simple full circle skirt! If you want I can pm you my bodice pattern for reference. 

Thank you so much for your compliment! I truly hope that you’ll be able to make the dress that is more beautiful than this one, and it’ll fit you like a on a princess❤️",6
15330,vfzh85,716bunnyma,"I needed to hear what you just said. I’m not the OP of course nor even a sewer, but there is great wisdom in your words. Thank you 🙏",2
15331,vfzh85,thimbled,SOOOO awesome that you stuck to it despite feeling discouraged! Your perseverance is admirable.,50
15332,vfzh85,Bearence,"I'm glad you kept trying! All those times you sucked were just practice for when you didn't. Or, as my mom says, ""the first one is the worst one"", meaning you can only ever get better at a skill. It looks like you got there in the end!",2
15333,vfzh85,desert_dame,"To properly sew a neckline or armhole. Several things. 
 .  Do a basting stitch slightly before the seam line along the curve. This stabilizes material especially silk.  Then sew the seam.  Then cut a few little triangles into seam side. And then carefully press out the seam. Another trick cut away half of one seam edge. Reduces bulk. Use an arm attachment on ironing board for best results. Use paper to not indent onto dress side if silk or satin. And then turn it out and in repress along the seam. It should lay nice and flat now.  If it sticks out curvy or wavy it’s because a basting stitch wasn’t used and you sewed too fast and stretched the material out. Hope this helps.",14
15334,vfzh85,desert_dame,Sure,7
15335,vfzh85,NonSecwitter,"Bro to sis... Don't ever call yourself average.

The love and effort are superior and the finished product is adorable... Makes you just want to pick her up and squeeze all the love into her!

Nicely done 🙂",14
15336,vfzh85,Wickedfrickin,"I cannot sew a stitch so when I see a lovely dress like that, that you made with your hands, it is absolutely a talent. Sometimes it can be hard to take a compliment, but this Mom wants you to accept that you are talented and go forth into the world considering yourself such, no more of this ""average"" business.",6
15337,vfzh85,tsophies,"I always say that anyone can sew, it's just construction with fabric. As you gain more experience, you'll get better at realising how the construction works. No -one knows how to build a brick wall in one day, they spend time building other walls and practicing. 

The dress is beautiful and a testament to your skills!

15339,vfzh85,Dark_Knight2000,"Little bro here. I know it’s tempting to see yourself as only average, but your kids certainly will not see it that way. The dress is fantastic and shows so much love and effort, they see you as this amazing, admirable, skilled, go-getter who makes them feel taken care of. Especially in a world where many moms don’t even try.

Also, you didn’t follow a template, you designed this dress. That’s objectively impressive, especially for your first time. This is just the start, there’s so much in store for you",2

I've done that and I've been sewing for years now. 10/10 do not recommend. Huge congrats on avoiding that.",1
15341,vfzh85,716bunnyma,"Ok so if I’m reading this right, 
you DESIGNED the dress!
Let that sink in. Well done!",3

15343,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,Thank you 🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️❤️,23
15344,vfzh85,Canttouchthisdudu,😨 oh. My God. I’m glad I didn’t. How did that happen to you and what did you do after that?,2
15345,vfzh85,716bunnyma,Thank you!,2
15346,vfzh85,EtainAingeal,"I was gathering a bodice with shirring elastic and paying too much attention to how it was gathering and not enough to where my extremities were (Side note:- i remember the possibility being mentioned in a sewing group and thinking, ""wow, how silly do you have to be, I can't imagine ever paying so little attention to where my fingers are while sewing""). Thankfully I had my hands rotated enough that the needle caught the side of the pad of my middle finger, rather than through a nail bed and I was using quite a light needle that broke so it didn't cause anywhere near as much damage as it could have. Still gave me a shock and plucking needle fragments out of my fingertip is something I hope to never have to repeat. If you're concerned about the possibility, they make finger guards to prevent you getting your fingers close enough to catch them.",2
15347,wq4pp7,NephMoreau,"Duckling, I am *so* proud of you! My own mother is an addict, and she’s never stayed clean, and watching her struggle means I have seen how difficult it is, and I could not be prouder of you!",468
15348,wq4pp7,i-havok,Hey kiddo - first of all - Bravo for sticking to your decision to stay clean. And second - this may come across as lame - but I think it was Mark Twain who wrote that the weakest of all weak things is a virtue that has not been tested in the fire. You are the person you are *because* you overcame addiction. You are stronger and better and wiser because of your journey. This is a true victory. This is exactly what life is about. Conquering weakness. Take a victory lap dearest and don't you dare doubt yourself or your value.,320
15349,wq4pp7,JennyLunetti,"Oh, hon, that's so hard! Yet you're doing so well! I'm proud of you. You're making good choices for yourself. There's nothing wrong with seeking support when you need it. That's exactly what healthy families do. They're there for you, though lots of times they don't know how to help until you ask. It's good that you tried to connect, sometimes knowing someone who got out makes a huge difference for someone recovering. You had no way of knowing that they weren't ready yet to be the sort of friend you deserve. It's possible they'll never get there. It's not your responsibility to change them or even to reach out to them in the future. It's your job to take care of you. To continue to make those good choices. I'm so glad you have a wonderful partner to stand with you. It's probably hard for them to consider how much it would hurt if you relapsed. A normal reaction to this from them will be panic, then relief mixed with coming down from the adrenaline response. That can be rough, but I'm sure they'll be there for you as they go through it. You can lean on each other because you have built a strong relationship. That's beautiful. Remember to give yourself credit for all the effort you have put into becoming a healthier, happier, person. You are doing really well. It's just extra hard today. You're going to get through this. Recognizing the spiral is the first step to stopping it.",79
15350,wq4pp7,ThaneOfCawdorrr,"OMG I AM SO PROUD OF YOU

You can't imagine how proud I am of you

I would jump up and down and dance around you and hug you if I was with you. 

Oh honey, you passed the HARDEST TEST EVER.  What a terrible ""friend"" the other person is.   He relapsed (if he ever was in recovery) so he wanted company in his misery.  Block him forever--he's not your friend.   But LOOK AT YOU.  You said NO.  

YOU ARE CLEAN and with the temptation right in front of you, you stayed clean. 

And please, please, don't feel shame at your former self.  You were in pain, you got into the trap, and you GOT OUT.   I think there's a lot that happened emotionally here, and your emotions are triggered.... but please don't feel anything except PROUD OF YOURSELF. 

If it helps, let me just share how I feel as a mom of a son who is struggling.  My own son is still in the mists of his addiction, has been for years now, and if he could just get clean.... and stay clean... and then resist temptation.... how happy I would be.  I wouldn't care for one second about the past.  The past would be past.  I wouldn't think ""he was undeserving,"" I would think ""I am so happy my son has his life back, I am so happy I have my son back.""  It's all I hope for.  

I am just so proud of you.",74
15351,wq4pp7,Wht-ever,I am a mom of a deceased child who died of a heroin overdose. I know first hand how difficult your struggle has been. But now you are doing awesome! You set boundaries for yourself and stuck with them. Good for you! The guilt and/or shame you feel is your brain lying to you. Don't believe it. You have nothing to be ashamed of and everything to be proud of. There are many mothers out there who wish our child had the strength and courage you do! Overcoming addiction is the hardest battle anyone can fight. And you did it! Keep it up!,212
15352,wq4pp7,LaCroix_Lime,I’m a mom and I want you to know that I’m proud of you. You must have such strength of character to overcome all you have in your life. It takes a lot of courage to face your demons and it seems as though you’ve walked away stronger.,44
15353,wq4pp7,toricoon,"You did great! We all have a past. A lot of people aren’t proud of everything they did. But you did what you can, you didn’t do it today. Staying clean is incredibly difficult and I’m proud of you.",31
15354,wq4pp7,tkm1026,"Oh I'm so proud of you darling. And yes, you are fishing for validation, and you SHOULD. This is how it works. None of us can be your real mom, but if we could this is exactly the kind of thing you could come to any one of us with and get the congratulations you deserve. 

You've come so far dearheart. You even let down your guard and assumed the best of your old friend, that was so brave. Him not being ready doesn't change how impressive -you- are. And you faced down that temptation, that temptation that got baked into your brain before you even knew better, and said no. 

You kept the person you've worked to become safe and well. You've saved us from a world dimmed by your absence. Thank you baby. Keep taking that great care of you. You are worth taking good care of..",32
15355,wq4pp7,eyesabovewater,"You are AWESOME!! So proud of you!!  Quick little story for that ""shame"" you feel... i work on a hospitial campus.  Looking out of the windows, the infamous methadone door.  You probably know .. the one that locks if you are late?  I would show my students that door.  Tell them...watch who goes in... not her, thats a grandma.. not him...he's one of the doctors... not her, shes pushing 3 little kids.... YES.  All of them.

Doesn't it feel good to stand up and make good decisions for yourself?  You faced something hard, and you did the right thing, and that is amazing!

I may not be your mom, but I am A Mom, and I am literally sitting here with a big smile on my face because of how well you did.",20

15359,wq4pp7,PollyPepperTree,That’s amazing!! Congrats. You should be so proud and confident rn.,15
15360,wq4pp7,sixthandelm,"That is some damn impressive shit. Fish all you want… you deserve all the praise you can reel in because you know what? The MAJORITY of those people turning up their noses at drug addicts or even former addicts have NEVER had to do anything as hard as what you did. I don’t care if they’ve had surgery or fought off a robber or even been in war (well, I do care, but I’m not as impressed as I am with what you did) because fighting willpower is harder than fighting any external enemy. Self doubt and shame make the fight unfair and you. Won. Anyways. 

Even if you fail in the future, you can remember this because I know it was damn hard. You’ll remember you did it once, you can do it again. 

And don’t you dare feel shame. You are a victim. I am filled with rage for the child you were and the people who hurt you, and I’m glad you clawed your way out so you broke the cycle and didn’t bring any kids you have it will have into your past hell. 

Stand tall, you are one hell of a fighter, even if you feel weak. Don’t believe that you are weak… that’s the enemy talking and he won’t win.",12
15361,wq4pp7,CharlotteLucasOP,"Big sis here, definitely proud of you for making the wise choice, hard as it can be. It’s okay to not be okay, it’s normal to feel a bit rattled by something like this. Seeing someone from that period of your life and seeing them struggle is probably bringing up memories or associations you haven’t touched in a while, and it’s gonna sting a bit. Be gentle with yourself!",10
15362,wq4pp7,SirPotatoKing,"Little brother here, I was also an addict. I’ve been clean for 9 months now. I’m proud of you for staying clean, you and I both know damn well it’s a real struggle staying clean and sober. I’m so glad you stuck to your guns and didn’t take the bait. I too feel shame at times for being a junkie but then I remember the progress I made. Keep being sober and keep going ❤️",10
15363,wq4pp7,Maamwithaplan,This is a huge deal. You should be so proud! That takes a lot to say no! I am proud of you!,9
15364,wq4pp7,Scout405,"You have grown to be a strong and resilient adult through the difficult choices you made to change and have a healthy life.  You were a child, at a very impressionable age, without the tools to resist becoming an addict—it was never a choice you made.  Far too many people are, sadly, unable to stop self-destructive patterns of behavior.  You are a success.  Hold onto who you are now.  Past mistakes do not define us as we move forward and enjoy a healthy life.  If your partner is upset because they're scared, please ask them to read all these comments.

You deserve your happiness that you've made, and so much more. Heroin has taken so much from your life, and it doesn't deserve any more of your time or energy. I love you, little duck. I know how difficult it can be, from watching family members and how it affected them. My inbox is open if you want to talk. Be kind to yourself. Big mom hugs, if you want them.",7

It’s clear by the way you write that you are super emotionally intelligent and committed every day to walk this path. Very, very well done!

Also… I may have to cop that idea of physically writing nice comments from redditors/online friends! I have a folder in my Photos where I put my “happies,” compliments/kind things that make me smile 🖤",3

15381,wq4pp7,PurpleMoomins,"Another mom checking in to tell you how proud I am! Im teary eyed here, reading your story. This is not small, don’t think like that! We are here for you! Anytime. 

Regarding your partner, I don’t know how long you’ve been with them, but if they haven’t been a part of this past and if drugs are not something they’ve had in their life one way or another, maybe they could benefit with reading up on addiction and sobriety, maybe even try to go to a group? I think it’s totally normal they’re freaking out a bit, they were just reminded of your past and it’s scary. You’ve lived with it your whole life, but I’m sure they just started imagining how things could go. That leads to some big feelings. Sobriety and addiction is complex. So they probably need hugs and maybe talk about it. Communication in any relationship is key, and I’m proud of you for telling your partner what happened.

Sending you love and hugs. Kisses from your very proud mother",3

I'm so sorry he did that. I'm so sorry you had to experience any of that. That shame you feel is for HIM, not a reflection of you. You stayed strong, you did what was right for you and the people you love. You did everything right.

I wish you could truly understand how proud we are of you. I wish that you were even a fraction as proud of yourself as we are. 

The real beauty of life lies in recognizing when you aren't honoring the gift of it, and then changing whatever you're doing to create that disrespect.

My husband is almost 20 years clean from meth now. I have faith in his sobriety, but he works in kitchens - where drugs are a big subculture.  I work in mental health, so I know how difficult the sobriety journey can be for folks. It’s always a worry in the back of my head that something can happen. We had one somewhat of a close call like yours and though it ended up like yours, a part of my brain wanted to go down the what if spiral. 

Just continue to be open and honest about your feelings with your partner, and you’re gonna be just fine.",2

I've been clean awhile myself and work a job where I need to clean up the premises in an area addicts come to get high. I've found myself staring at bags of drugs plenty of times and instead of taking the opportunity to put them in my pocket I take the opportunity to throw them away and even after years how difficult it can still feel to turn them away. You did the right thing and that is deserving of recognition!,2
15410,wq4pp7,asghettimonster,"Listen please.  You by yourself hour by hour, minute by minute, have achieved something so unthinkably difficult that most people never even try.  You got clean. THEN you also built a life, stayed clean, found a love,  and every second of all of that you've, in your head by yourself, made the right choices to remain clean and sober.  I'm crying here because you've earned respect..... your own.... for what you have DONE. and yet you feel ashamed that the things which brought you down happened.  Still crying with frustration here. 12 years old and it was done TO you.  You deserve respect.  You deserve to know that what you did to get clean and do every single damned day still, are respectable, admirable actions.  And they are FUCKING HARD. 
No not off the hook but you're not claiming that.  
Humility is necessary, accountability is required, strength of conviction is imperative. And. AND, acknowledging what has been achieved is vital,  because in the acknowledgement is an honoring of sponsors, family, friends, others on the same path and those walking next to them, deserve your re- thanks for the assist and that includes you. Not pride but acknowledgement of just how much it takes.  
Keep this granny's educated respect.  There is no more difficult road, and you are walking it.  Humble does not= unacknowledged.  Okay? I'm so behind you every step of the journey.  My spirit goes out to you.  Use it for good.  Granny hugs 🤗",2

Understand that you'll probably feel pretty shitty for a bit, because even victories are draining. But once that subsides, go ahead and savor the sense of accomplishment.

15492,wq4pp7,unbrielievable_huh,"Oh my little love, I am so very, very proud of you. For your resilience, for your honesty, for your strength - I have loved several addicts and please believe me when I tell you that all these things are hard-won, and you have to choose them every day. You *are* choosing them every day. 

I'm just thrilled that you have a partner who is proud of you, baby. Creating loving, supportive relationships takes an enormous amount of work, you know - please recognize that you have put in the work to get into a healthy relationship, too! If I were him (and I have been), I would be upset, too - not because you did anything wrong, but because someone I cared about was vulnerable to hurt, and is having a hard time. 

You know him best, but would you  consider talking to him and sharing that you're feeling vulnerable in your relationship with him and with yourself? Try to be present with him (and not the shame) - and trust that he knows his feelings best and is trying to be honest with you too.

You've probably heard this a million times, but I found the concept that addiction is ""cunning, baffling and powerful"" has really stuck with me and helped put things in perspective. You've experienced a great deal of trauma at a young age and it is absolutely textbook for shame to become a protective armour to help make sense of the ways that your caregivers/adults in your life have failed you, and to keep you physically and psychologically safe. 

You don't need this armour any more and you are learning to let it go, but it's a process, and usually a little messy, nothing you are doing wrong. Your feelings of shame and undeservingness are not true, but they are real, if that makes sense. Try to sit with them, notice them. Journaling on reddit and reflecting on other peoples' perspectives is an excellent strategy for self-care. You are so brilliant and resourceful! 

I love you, and I believe in you. And you deserve all the love in the world. <3",2

I’m really grateful to be sober. I don’t know if I’m proud because it feels like a gift but I am not down on myself for what I did. You can’t be. For some of us it actually saved our life at the time to live through the unbearable. Others it’s a genetic thing.

The proven answer from anyone in recovery is that you never are really over it completely. You could have given in. You could have convinced yourself that one more time wouldn't hurt....but you didn't. 

Whether conscious or not, you made the decision that it wasn't worth it. Your current life is worth more to you than chasing the high you used to find. Whatever your reasons for using in the past, you have more reasons not to now.

Be proud of yourself for the journey you're on and how far you've come. Appreciate your partner and try to understand that you are absolutely worthy of love and support. Your partner is probably upset because they are scared of the what ifs that could have changed both of your lives. Give yourself and them some grace.",2

That is in no way shameful whatsoever. It might feel that way because you regret that chapter but you have fought to be here where you are now. You have struggled and persevered. You do that every day you reject returning to that chapter. You deserve every bit of it and you deserve to be proud of yourself for not just building those future for yourself but protecting it. 

With your choice, you protected yourself, your partner, and who you will be. You have been honest, sought support, and are actively reflecting on your choices. Most people, addiction entirely aside, struggle to do that and do it wholely. You are doing so incredibly well and I am so proud of you. 

That chapter of your life does not define you. You don't deserve any less love or celebration just because it's a part of your life. You are a whole and valid human being who is actively writing goodness into existence with your choices and that's the most anyone can be asked to do. 

You deserve to be here.",2
15505,wq4pp7,youngtundra777,"Oh my goodness honey I am so, so proud of you for being strong! There's no shame in who you are, and 12 year old you would be so happy to see you doing the work!

Super proud of you!",2
15510,wq4pp7,BertxErnie,"Hey big sis, my dad died of an overdose several years ago because of “just one more time.” It would have meant the world to me if he were strong enough to turn away his addictions for me. 
And so the fact that you were strong enough to turn him away makes me really happy. I’m glad you’re still here, I’m proud of you and of your recovery, of your strength. You should feel nothing but pride in yourself. 

Thank you. 🤍",2

And you've done all the right things, reaching out to your partner for support in a difficult time and communicating openly and honestly. That is so admirable and honestly what I wish for everybody.

You are so strong and so confident, making your decision and sticking by it for more than ten years. The struggles you've been through and the good life you've made for yourself from that pain is more than proof enough that you deserve the support and love of all of us as well as your partner.

A lot of people don’t realize that small relapses are actually more likely to kill you, your body is no longer accustomed to the drugs so even if you do less than you used to you can still overdose.  So thank you for saying no and for still being here 💜",2
15521,wq4pp7,UniformWormhole,So fucking proud of you 🌸,2
15522,wq4pp7,lickyourwounds,I’m really proud of you.,2
15523,wq4pp7,lahnamama,I'm so proud of you! Addiction recovery is one of the hardest things to do as is saying no to temptation. Congratulations on your incredible strength!,2
15524,wq4pp7,Pur1wise,"Getting sober is hard. Staying sober is even harder. I’m SO proud of you for those ten years. That’s three thousand six hundred and fifty or more days that you woke up
and chose not to use! That’s huge! I’m even prouder of you for facing down temptation and coming out the other side of that still sober. You’ve achieved so much!

Now let’s address the shame. You were addicted at the age of twelve. Too young to understand the enormity of taking heroin. It was not your fault! You have nothing to be ashamed of at all. Even if you have have chosen it as a fully grown and fully informed adult it’s still nothing to be ashamed about. Nobody chooses addiction because they’re emotionally healthy. Every single addict I’ve ever met has been either self medicating to pull back some physical pain or to smother emotional pain somewhere in their life. It is a cry for help by making the internal issue an external issue. Addicts deserve compassion and understanding and they deserve help to treat both the issue of addiction as well as the foundation of pain that triggered the choice to use. You are not bad or awful or dirty or any of the things you tell yourself about your addicted period. You were in pain and you found a way to deal with it. I’m
 so sorry that you weren’t given the opportunity to heal that pain before addiction became an option for you.",2
15525,wq4pp7,AeternaeVeritatis,"That is incredible!! Just being able to say no, feel like you can be transparent with your partner, and keep clean is a victory.

Don't beat yourself up for being an addict. You kept clean, even with some hard-core convincing on your acquaintances part, and that is incredible. 

Be proud for your victories and try to make amends for any harm or pain you may have caused.",2
15526,wq4pp7,shewholaughslasts,"YAY YAY YAY! Congrats on staying clean! That's a really big step to be faced with your weakness and not fall prey to it. You won that day, sweetie and I'm so proud of you! Rock on!!",2
15527,wq4pp7,Emmylemming,"Honey, you've done so well. Getting clean and then staying clean is a massive feat and you should feel so proud of yourself. I'm certainly super proud!

I know it's difficult to accept support and love from people when you're used to being your own support system, but it's great that you're trying to let your partner be there for you; that's taking a lot of strength too! I'm so happy you've found someone to be there for you ❤",2

Fuck shame. Shame is a useless emotion anyway. 

You’re not a junkie — You’re a warrior. A light of hope. You’re the exact person ppl who are struggling dream of being. You are resilient. You are tough. You are brave. You are courageous. You are in recovery and never letting anyone take that away from you. 

If I was your Mom, I couldn’t be prouder. ❤️",2

15532,wq4pp7,catgirl320,"Oh my goodness... let's count the ways that you embody resilience and strength.

You went into recovery.
You have stayed in recovery for over ten years.
You built a new life and have partner that values and cherishes you.
When faced with temptation you recognized the harm it would to do to your life and relationship and removed yourself from the situation.
You were honest with your partner.

Hold your head up and be proud of yourself. Your past and whatever mistakes you made do not define you. Each day you are choosing to move past them. Each day you are growing and learning and choosing a better life for yourself. Yes, some days will be harder than others and you might stumble and fall, but when that happens your strength and resilience will hold you up as you determine the next step. 

You are wonderful and amazing and deserve a good, happy life.",2

1. From the deepest, darkest part of my heart, I know I chose to have my children, but they didn't have a choice in me. The weight is heavy, knowing I have to do right by them. 

2. That you have CHOSEN your true mom and dad is a greater gift to them than anything they can give to you. 


The love of our children is what fills us up, keeps us going. At least the good ones. There are a lot of shitty parents out there. I'm so glad you found a mom and dad, a place and a family you belonged to. You have both chosen each other. Cherish this beautiful gift.

I’m thrilled that you asked all the questions you needed to ask and got the kind of transparency and care, from all angles, that I thought you would. And omg, the stuff about names just has me all gushy and wanting to give all of you a big hug. 

I’m not a therapist, but I have to think that not giving in to the voice of the trauma is a massive step in your healing process, as an added bonus. You can be so proud of yourself for listening to your true voice, both to ask what needed to be asked and in making this decision.

I can’t imagine the emotions you’re feeling right now but I’m assuming it’s at least a million times what my stepmam and I felt the day I started calling her mam, when I realised that she loved me regardless of the fact that I wasn’t hers (and that I and her son from her first marriage have the same first name, to complicate things more).

I have had a quick read through and am glad you’re talking things through with a professional, plus I’m also so happy that your siblings (when it comes to family, there’s no complications to me like step-, half-, adopted-; you’re family, that stuff comes from love not blood or paperwork), have been so supportive and excited too. All that and taking a new middle name and your dad’s surname, it’s not even 4am here and this has made my day (and I’m off to a gig tonight!)

Man, I know summer is only just starting but I can’t wait for Christmas now; the lot of you getting together and just being your big family.

15858,v3lwwp,Inslia,"I read yesterday's post as well and I'm crazy pleased for you and think you made the right choice. The way I understood it from the previous post the bio's were parents and you owe them nothing. What you have now IS family.
I think you went the right way about it as well, in asking them for their side it gives you solid ammunition against the brain weasels. The other kids reaction is pretty solid as well with them referring to protecting you. It has all been for you to choose but it's an honest offer from them and I love the middle name idea it gives you all an extra layer of connection This sounds like a safe and loving space enjoy your life with them.",1

One of the sweetest things I’ve ever seen was what looked like a typical birth announcement, made by a gay couple and their first adopted son, when they legally adopted their second son that went something like 
‘We are thrilled to welcome our son and brother (name of the son)

Ahem, takes out megaphone:

YOU ARE SO LOVED & DESERViNG OF LOVE. You are a valuable person, and it is not dependent on what your productivity is, or what you give other people. You are amazing just the way you are. I am so happy for you that you found two kind loving parents that will give you the support and home you need. 

I don’t know if this helps. My brothers friend was orphaned around 14? Our other mutual friends parents took him in. As a 4th child. It’s been almost 20 years now and all that support and love is still there. 

There are good people in this world. Family isn’t always defined by fluids. You’re going to be ok.",1

15911,v3lwwp,,"Yea I can’t wait to find out a rough timeline of how long it’ll take, it’s dependent on when we can get a court date for family court, so a lawyer can’t really give a firm timeline. But it could be a few months. 

It’s still just a different feeling knowing tomorrow they’ll have their lawyer start the process. 

Plus having my siblings start a group chat and label the chat “[family last name] siblings”  - it’s like it took them less than 2 hours to make that and include me",44

I’ll be the only one of their children that has both of them on my birth certificate, so I wanted them to get to choose the middle name that I’ll have plus taking Dad’s last name, I know to some that all might seem dumb but to me it lets me move on from my past",3

16030,v3lwwp,custodescustodiet,"Hey, bunchkin. I know I already commented, but I wanted to say this very sternly. 

You aren't broken. There's NOTHING wrong with you. You are a phenomenally strong person who's endured a lot, and so you've had build responses and coping mechanisms to keep yourself safe. Some of those won't continue to help you, so we learn to untangle them slowly. It's a process. They are not taking on a broken kid, and this is not charity. You're doing great, and I know because you're letting yourself have family who loves you, and that's so hard after people who were supposed to be family teach you that family is scary. This is your parents who are desperate to love you, and you letting them do that. This is your parents who look at your beautiful face and say ""we are so lucky. We just want to help her and know her and be there for her and be part of her life."" You aren't broken. You don't need fixing. Family and therapy and support are things you GET. You GET to do therapy because you GET to feel secure and treat yourself with love and care. Of course you deserve it. There's nothing you could do that would mean you don't deserve your mom and dad loving you. It's in our bones and our blood. 


I watch my (19yo) baby sleep sometimes and think how beautiful he is. Even when he rages, when he cries, when he won't talk to me for days on end, when he can't get out of the spin cycle, he's my baby. And when his trauma responses kick in, that's my cue to stand solid and love him MORE, because he is entitled to trust that mom means mom, love means love, and there's no bar he needs to meet to earn or deserve it. He deserves it because he's a person. He's my son. He can't lose me. You deserve a family that's nuts about you, and I can't think of a single reason you wouldn't. 

Now, that's harder on the inside. We can see all the yuck and come up with reasons. But although the reasons are real, they aren't TRUE. And you, in return, are giving them the gift of their daughter, because you ARE a gift, and you are so, so wanted. 


And why on earth would they split lawyer costs? We don't charge our babies for hospital fees, and if we did, it'd be cruel and abusive. You aren't a different kind of daughter because you are heart-carried and not womb-carried. You're daughter. Children require time, energy, money, and patience. Super easy to think you aren't worth those. Guarantee your parents totally disagree. They pay the lawyer like they pay the doctor because that's how they get their baby they so desperately want. And bonus? They know whom they're choosing with you. With most babies it's a crapshoot. You they know, you they choose, you they love on purpose, eyes wide open. 


Often when young people are adopted into a Jewish family and want to become Jewish, they have to convert. Our rabbi looked at our son after hearing his story when he was trying to figure out if he had a right to the rituals of our family and our people, and she said, ""This is so obviously your mom. You're just home a little late. Your mom is Jewish. Kids of Jewish moms are Jewish. Of course you're Jewish.""

You are finally coming home. This IS your family, even if it took longer to get there than for some. Welcome home, baby. You're not different. You get unreserved love.",5
16031,v3lwwp,werewolfjrjr,You are not broken. You have been hurt to the depths of your soul. But the core of you is whole and precious and you are absolutely worthy of all this love. You always were- it's just been late in getting to you.,3

16050,v3lwwp,,"Yea that’s true, a lot of it is really so that they can protect me legally. 

My biological family that is still living has nothing to do with me. This family that’s adopting me is all I have, but if something bad happened to me they have no legal ability to advocate for my health care etc. 

So a big part of the decision on everyone’s end is that it protects me as their child now in an emergency and when they pass away someday",11
16051,v3lwwp,,"Yea I can’t wait for the day I get to officially have the same last name as them, and be their Kid in every way, I know to them I already am, but that piece of paper does help me feel secure",44

16057,v3lwwp,werewolfjrjr,Yes! They love being your parents. It fulfills them and brings them the deepest joy and satisfaction to care and provide for you. It is absolutely a gift to them to allow them to do so.,1
16058,v3lwwp,,"Idk why this has got me all teary but it does, especially your perspective on the lawyer......and they’ve definitely loved me through some hard days. 

Heck Dad and I had our first ever major argument two weeks ago and I was scared to death he wouldn’t want me anymore, but he just has treated me the exact same as always. 

It’s just hard for me to adjust to not owing my fair share of a cost that directly is a result of me",3

16061,v3lwwp,,"They’re all amazing people, way better people than I deserve, but I’m thankful they chose me",7
16062,v3lwwp,,Thanks,1
16063,v3lwwp,,"Thanks, they chose my middle name today, and we signed the first round of paperwork. 

After the last 48 hours I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed and starting to emotionally and mentally burn out. 
Dad offered for me and my dog to stay a couple more nights so they can take care of me/look out for me while I let my emotions and everything stable out since they know if I get overwhelmed with this much stuff I sometimes shut down then I’ll seclude myself at home all alone and shutdown further.

So I guess I’m staying with Mom and Dad a few more days and going to try to let them baby me a little so I can focus on grounding my emotions again

I’m so happy but I’m also nearing my emotional max",1
16064,v3lwwp,,It’s just hard to process it all. That they’re really choosing me and not hesitating to start the process,2
16065,v3lwwp,,"Thanks!!!

I hope they didn’t go this route because of my insecurities. I hope it’s something they truly wanted regardless of my insecurities",3
16066,v3lwwp,,It’s just a change to mentally tell myself I can let them take care of me in those little ways without them expecting me to prove I deserve it,2
16067,v3lwwp,,"I’ve just been hanging out all day until we meet with the lawyer and just taking in the feelings.

16072,v3lwwp,xinfinitimortum,As a dad i just want to say that you dont need to feel bad at all about the costs. There is no monetary value on love. They would do it if it costs nothing or a billion dollars.,27

16075,v3lwwp,CeelaChathArrna,This is them taking care of their child. The first time they get to legally take care of you as their child. I am certain for them paying the fees is very symbolic. There's no need to feel guilty.,3
16076,v3lwwp,custodescustodiet,"Hey, bunchkin. We just completed this process a few months ago with our nineteen year old. I remember so clearly the day he asked if he could call me mom; I remember choosing a name with him. He's an adult, too, going to college next year, and I'm gonna miss him like crazy. I want to tell you this, in case the fear gets in at night:
You ARE their child. I've given birth, and I have this boy. And just because I did not carry him with my body does not mean I don't love him exactly the same way. I've held him when he cried, gone to sports games, taken care of him when he was sick, and every moment of it is an honor. He was ours the moment he said yes, and the paper still made it feel real. You are their child in every possible way. Our son can't lose us, no matter how hard he tries. I'm so, so happy that you have gotten to go home, too.",12
16077,v3lwwp,MotorReserve,I am so happy for you!,6

16080,v3lwwp,bluewinter182,You deserve every bit of it - congrats sis!,4
16081,v3lwwp,that-writer-kid,"Whether or not you deserve it (and you do), they want you there! You’ll absolutely do them proud.",2
16082,v3lwwp,custodescustodiet,"I told my son I was so excited for the day we had our first fight, because he'd get to see the other side and know I love him same as always - and maybe more, because now I know more about him I can love. Congrats on your first fight, sweetpea. That's powerful.

Yes. That makes sense. Especially when you've been taught that being just plain cared for is a child's right. It is not your fair share. It is part of parenting. You're not the parent, you don't pay that cost. And it feels like it's a result of you, but its the other way around. You're a result of it. They pay it because they want a paper that says, ""literally no one can question she's ours. Come at us."" They GET to pay for that. They WANT to. The lawyer fee is incidental to what's really going on here. It's an entrance fee FOR THEM. They're getting to enter parenthood together, and they get you. They'll amend your birth certificate, I imagine. It'll have their names as your parents. They are paying for that right. That isn't your fee to pay.

And they may pay for other things too in your life. So when you start feeling guilt about that, ask yourself whether it'd be uncomfortable if your parents paid for your siblings. If it wouldn't be, they get to pay for you. We GET to. I'm 34, my granddad and I still fight about who is paying for flights home, and I've lost every fight for fifteen years. And I go into it knowing I'm going to.

Right now our son is learning to pay for some fixed expenses himself, which makes me feel like an awful person because I don't want him to feel abandoned, but he does need to slowly learn to budget for that so he doesn't freak out when he's short and stop eating. And he also needs to know that we're there as a fallback if he needs. And that as long as we're all alive, we will continue to give him care and treats and love. He GETS to be able to be independent because he knows he's able to stand on his own feet, and not because he has no choice. You, too. This isn't your fair share to pay. You're not their partner and not their friend. You're their daughter.",3
16083,v3lwwp,DavidW273,"I agree with u/werewolfjrjr - this is in no way dumb. You’re doing this out of love which is just beautiful; any meaning, or lack thereof, does not matter.

16088,v3lwwp,khalja-ghatayin,"Yes I understand but that's because they love you haha ! They are your parents now. One day, it won't feel scary or unreasonable to say out loud. You'll feel confident and happy. This is just the beginning so it's a bit of adjustment. It's all gonna be okay, you can trust them, they're here for you.",1
16089,v3lwwp,werewolfjrjr,"They wanted it. I promise you that, and you know it too, hon, looking at their faces when you said yes and told them about them picking a name.

So it was weekly for like 6-8 months and now it’s ever other week.",91

I mean that’s probably true and it very well could be less than 10K for all this, but I didn’t agree with the expectation that they would pay all costs",3

16098,v3lwwp,,"I missed this comment until now, and they’ve told me before that I’m loved just as much as their other children, that the bonding process was different because I was 17-19 years old when they met me but that I’m not loved less, it just developed differently. 

They’ve taken care of me after two surgeries, supported my college athletic career they made every game they could. 

They’ve told me a million times I’m “stuck with them” 

Mom told me part of their desire to pursue adoption was after I had chest pains in February and a blood pressure of 196/111 and I need an EKG, chest X-ray and lots of blood work. I was in the hospital for 10 hours and they wouldn’t let either of them be with me because they weren’t “family”",6

And yea I was homeless at 17 and had to learn early on to be super independent, so I’ve always struggled to let them buy me dinner or accept Christmas or birthday gifts. I’ve always felt I had to pay my own way.

16110,v3lwwp,custodescustodiet,"Yup. That's a learned behavior and a growth edge. I'm glad you know about it. You're practicing the art of letting people care for you. Scary, dangerous, and worth it. In the year my son has been home, he's exponentially better at it. Not over it. But better.


When the lawyer thing eats at you, breathe through it and remind yourself lawyer is doctor. The fee is... God, who even cares about the fee. I'd have paid whatever I needed to to get us into that courtroom. And it was so much less than I thought it was going to be. We're not rich,  but we did not give a DAMN about the money. We got our SON out of it. I'm so glad to have been able to help at all. 

Also, from your previous thread: 
I sat with my son on a couch when he was seventeen and said, ""would you let us be your family? We love you and we want you and I know it's scary--"" and he cut me off and said yes.
Sometimes you know. It's not insane to feel a deep love for your parents. And they are your parents. And you're their real daughter. This is just paperwork. Such joyful paperwork. You should see pictures from the day our adoption went through. 


I'm so happy for you. DM any time, ok? If the worms are getting into your brain or whatever else. We've been through this, and I'm happy to be here for you.",1
16111,v3lwwp,custodescustodiet,"OH. Name. It's not ""just"" a middle name. It's you asking them to NAME you. You'll carry that around with you. Our son is trans. He'd have chosen his own name anyway. Lots of kids do. That you're opening yourself to what parents often do, which is have some input on names, middle or otherwise, is amazing. And yes. It's such a beautiful feeling carrying that name and carrying their last name and knowing that you're really really theirs. Congrats on the names and the family. I love that you and your mom and dad get to do this together.",1

I know it can be really hard to believe people actually care about you and won't just leave, but having that piece of paper and that groupchat helps as solid anchors to shove in the face of your trauma response anxiety.

1. Can you breathe in it? All night?
2. Will the bodice move or shift? Can you laugh/eat/dance without fear of popping a boob?
3. The train is gorgeous, but make sure you have a solution for it (like a snap, or a band around the wrist) if you plan on dancing with any sort of vigor—you don't want yourself or one of your guests to trip up in it or make you trip!

Take pictures in your head, remember the sights, sounds, feels. Don’t scrimp or hold back on the things you REALLY WANT! Yes, weddings get expensive.
Choose keepsakes over napkins. (We have Jo Anne & Chuck’s stirrers from 6/23/79, still!)❤️

It’s a wedding, a party, an occasion to CELEBRATE! All who love you, we will want to help, let us help with the little things! Ask for opinions, suggestions, folding, packing, pick-ups & drop-offs.

16554,u5p2he,RedChairBlueChair123,"2b. If you are under bright lights, can you see nip (if that’s something you don’t want to show)? 

You may not want pieces showing in every photo. It can have lining added. 

Also remember you may lose weight and to have a last possible moment fitting. Tailoring is what makes a dress look expensive.",5

16558,u5p2he,katbird16,she did. thanks!,6
16559,u5p2he,shewholaughslasts,AND it looks this fabulous?! Winner! I love how the lace design is lovely yet subtle - not completely covering things just gorgeous all over. Just like OP's smile! Pockets or no - the one that makes you light up like that is the winner. Congratulations sweetie!,19
16560,u5p2he,InformationThiick,"What an absolutely stunning gown! You have a wonderful sense of style. This looks great on you, and you can tell by the expression on your face that you love it!",41
16561,u5p2he,DinnrWinnr,"Yeah she said 2019 and she’s clearly not a teenager, so as an adult, she decided not to talk to her mother. Either way I’m in the shit.",2
16562,u5p2he,DinnrWinnr,Well I’m not a mom but it’s a very nice wedding dress.,1
16563,u5p2he,Cuppiecake88,We all make mistakes. Honestly I probably came across harsh because I have a horrible relationship with my family due to their addiction issues so I can definitely understand her potential pain. All we can do is the best we can with the information we have at the moment.,1
16564,u5p2he,DinnrWinnr,"I’m the opposite but my kids don’t talk to me (or their mom even though they live in the same house). If there had been anything bad, I could understand but we’ve given them nothing but love and support. I guess I reacted without thinking it through and I’m sorry to all here for projecting.",1
16565,u5p2he,Cuppiecake88,"Not trying to attack you but is there a chance your children did try to tell but you didn't understand? I have a 13 year old and 8/10 if we have an issue it's because of miscommunication. I highly recommend family therapy, given I know its not available to everyone.

Edit:  also each person experiences life differently and it may seriously be just a misunderstanding or something you weren't even aware of doing. Different things feel bad to different people. The best thing I learned for my son and myself was to always be willing to admit that I could be wrong and how to say sorry.",1
16566,u5p2he,DinnrWinnr,"It is entirely possible. It never occurred to me to question my parents, so may not have been ‘listening’ to my children.",2
16567,u5p2he,Cuppiecake88,Exactly. I was taught to never question my elders and they never asked me what I thought so I didn't understand how talking was going to lead to anything other than yelling and violence. I had to work with a therapist and learn to really hear what my son was saying. My kiddo and I both express ourselves very differently. Also this sucks but sometimes you have to admit some of your decisions in the past were based off misunderstandings or just not being taught yourself how to handle these situations. We can hurt people unintentionally but that doesn't mean we don't owe them a hug and a sincere apology.,1
16568,v4mq7s,Drama_owl,"I would never have guessed this was your first attempt; it's beautiful! Did you enjoy it? I don't cross stitch often enough, but when I do I find it very relaxing (until my thread gets tangled, grrr...).",93

16641,v4mq7s,Little_Blue_Shed,"It's gorgeous and I second all the other Mom's encouraging you to post to r/crossstitch as well; you should be really, really proud! Would you like to do another one or are you thinking about a new project? If you'd like a couple of hints and tips for the next, I'm happy to share them - but they are just hints and tips because you have the most difficult bits down pat (like your tension and precision) and the fact that you're already at the 'perfecting' stage is so impressive (and I'm about 5% envious and 95% desperately proud!)

 I hope you are planning to hang it up somewhere where it's in your eye-line to remind you of the new skills you've taught yourself so you feel proud when you see it? I'm so impressed with you just for sticking with it, but it's an AMAZING first try - did you enjoy doing it? What did you like and hate about learning how to do this?",1

16652,v4mq7s,TheDiplocrap,"Well done! Let me tell you what my grandma told me when I finished my first piece after she’d taught me: Always hang onto your first piece, no matter what. If you don’t, she said, later you’ll look back and wish you still had it. She told me she’d given away the first cross stitch she finished, and always regretted it.

Nice work. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",1

I've spent way too long worrying about whether I look masculine enough (when I thought I was a boy) and all I got in return were a buttload of anxiety. It was only when I stopped caring about societal expectations that I found mental peace. And who says men cannot be feminine or girls can't be masc? These are all rules people who've been dead for over a millenium made and I say it's about time we change them!,34

16990,v9vfjk,MaintenanceWine,"Sending you one. You will get through this. I promise. Take a day or two to cry and wallow if you need to, then make a plan to take a small step to fixing what’s wrong. Call a friend, look up classes, look for a counselor, start looking at resumes, whatever. Just a tiny step. You can do this, you will get through it, everything will work out in the end. You are loved and worth love. Head high, sweetheart. You are strong.",5
16991,v9vfjk,Southernpalegirl,"Hugs and more hugs sent. You are going to get through this, it’s okay not to be okay just don’t let it eclipse the good things in your life and your future.

Your head is on my shoulder and I’m rocking you a tiny bit and telling you I love you exactly as you are and I’m so proud of you for everything you’ve overcome. I’m rubbing your back and hugging your head with my other hand. You feel so good in my arms. You are worth all the good things in the world, sweetheart.",6

17001,v9vfjk,MaintenanceWine,"Everybody screws up, sweetheart. It’s what you do after. Start making better choices, even if they’re small. One tiny step at a time. I know you can do it because I know your true heart. And know that I love you no matter what.",2
17002,v9vfjk,Southernpalegirl,"Everyone has made fuck ups, how do you think we learned what to teach you not to do? But the secret is that life isn’t ruined unless you stop trying. You learn from your mistakes, you make better choices next time and you step up in single thing you do. It’s hard, sometimes painfully slow but you can and will get past it. Don’t hate yourself, love that you are always going to be the best parts of your momma by taking the lessons learned and proving you listened when it counted.",2
17003,v9vfjk,PrissyKitty1,Things WILL get better! I know it may be tough rn and you’ve already been thru a lot but ur tougher than nails and as strong as can be! U got this hunni and im here for ya if u ever need someone to talk to 💕,2
17004,v9vfjk,MaintenanceWine,"Sweetie, it will get SO much better. You are in an extremely difficult situation right now, and I encourage you to find a safe place where you can be yourself and get help with the trauma you’ve experienced and are experiencing. Perhaps a school counselor, or a friend’s parent, or online counseling. Don’t give up though. You have a few years before you can leave, but you CAN and MUST. So that’s your light at the end of your tunnel. Work towards a plan to get out when you graduate. Don’t live at home if you go to college. 

You will stay strong and proud of exactly who you are. There is nothing wrong with who you are, only with what’s happened to you. Hugging you hard, telling you I love you exactly as you are, and that you’re an amazing human being I’m proud to know.

I know your experience is complex and I'm not trying to downplay that, but I *do* want to roll in and put some sis energy on this:

You came in like an absolute fucking *badass* and gave death and god the middle finger. THAT is absolute VICTORY and I hope more than anything that you feel like a fucking boss. From here on out, you *earned* your time on this Earth. I hope you feel proud of yourself, or if you're not feeling that, I hope you at least feel proud of what your body did for you. That body of yours fought tooth and nail against itself to get to today, and it deserves a little love and appreciation (and, if you're not pickin' up what I'm puttin' down, I mean that *you* deserve love and appreciation.)

You did an amazing, difficult thing. It was hard earned, and now here you are. You did it.",5

I was told I wouldn't be able to conceive naturally shortly after starting my periods at 8. I later found out I could but would be extremely high risk, I'm saying this to explain why I'm giving the advice I'm about to give. Implantation hurts,  I was so very frightened with my eldest given the high risk & a previous loss... Thankfully my sister was a mother of two & calmed me down. I still spoke to my midwife, but just think it's something women are rarely told & should know. Knowing with my second I told him to burrow in nice & snug... It doesn't last long. 


On the awesome things you'll soon experience baby's heartbeat, I was unaware I'd hear it so soon, my husband couldn't make the appointment so my sister took me. We were both crying & I recorded it on my phone. That son is 15 now, so wasn't best sound quality but enough to make my hubby tear up. I listen to that sound so many times between appointments.

17325,yhis54,JeMappelleBitch,This is so cute lol,17
17326,yhis54,PeanutQuest,"My dad worked with a woman who was trying to get pregnant, and eventually her and her wife decided to switch and see if they had more luck. There ended up being some overlap and suddenly both of them were pregnant, and one had twins.",16
17327,yhis54,CopperPegasus,"Not OP, just a person having a real sh!tty day in a really sh!tty year... and the image of two angry preggie ladies colliding like those people who run at balance balls and bouncing away put a much needed smile on my face. So thanks for that!",9
17328,yhis54,monkeymastersev,"Your reminding me of a meme that went like 

When two pregnant people start fighting it's like the babies are having a mecha fight",3
17329,yhis54,mayonnaiseskylab,This sounds like a funny AF children's book. 🤣,2
17330,yhis54,pleasemakemelol,"Thanks for the advice! It does get hot here, we're in the PNW so it's not as bad as where you are, but the last couple of summers have been VERY hot. I'll remember this!",71
17331,yhis54,song_of_storms5460,"I can absolutely relate to this comment!! Both of mine were conceived end of October, and holy moly Roly poly were those summers hot and miserable!!! 😭🤣 Cold and frozen treats will be a must OP!!",3
17332,yhis54,pleasemakemelol,"Thanks for confirming what you see too, of course we will be going for a confirmatory blood test tomorrow, but I think they're all faint positives!",44
17333,yhis54,pleasemakemelol,"Congratulations! Yes, I (we) are as ready as we can be for how she’s feeling. So far, the exhaustion checks out. She’s been extra tired the last couple of weeks. I’m trying to encourage her to listen to her body and rest when she’s tired. Thank you for the advice, and I hope your journey goes smoothly.",9
17334,yhis54,pleasemakemelol,"Thanks, haha, I hope for the same! Well it’s technically our fourth try as a couple, but first IUI at the clinic.",14
17335,yhis54,,[removed],2
17336,yhis54,pleasemakemelol,"Ha! We took one yesterday afternoon and saw the faint line, but didn't want to get too excited so we waited until this morning, when the doctor originally suggested we try. Two more faint lines = 3 total faint lines... I think we can believe it! No such thing as being a little pregnant, learned that from this sub!",28

17341,yhis54,anxiety_queen2012,Where do you get off saying such a thing here?,4
17342,yhis54,chrysolyte,"Best indicator that you’ll be great parents! Would be wrong not to be a little nervous too! Now you have months and months ahead of you that you can spend to get on the same page in all the little details. If you need a nice book to start conversations get a copy of Philipps Perry‘s „the Book you wish your parents had read“, we got a lot of great convos going with it!",38
17343,yhis54,googlepest,BROO having one newborn and giving birth was so hard I can’t imagine planning twins and two partners recovering from birth some people are just built different I’m soft as counter butter,58
17344,yhis54,wheatgrass_feetgrass,I just realized it sort of turned out that way that we're boinking around. That 1 singular pregnancy turned into a big ole snuggle monster who's neurodivergency manifests in interesting ways one of which is sleeping in between his moms for his entire life (please be a joke please be a joke). We have a large bed but he's a large 6 year old human. I used to ask my wife to pull my arm to help me roll over and now she has to ask me to pull the overgrown prairie dog out from under her flank.,9
17345,yhis54,Unimprester,"LOL we're not even trying yet and my husband turns pale when he hears stories about surprise triplets and people who had 1, wanted a second and then had twins or triplets. I think he thinks 2 is enough 😂",9
17346,yhis54,WonFriendsWithSalad,Oh my god that's frankly terrifying. At that point you need to open up the relationship and find a unicorn willing to help you both lol,3
17347,yhis54,Dizzy_Duck_811,"Hey, i hope you get better soon. I’m here if you need to vent. (I don’t mean to be creepy, that’s how my comment sounds lol!)",3
17348,yhis54,wheatgrass_feetgrass,"That sounds badass. In reality it's more like when the oompa loompas are rolling violet beauregard's giant blueberry ass to the ""pressing room"".",1
17349,yhis54,RespectableLurker555,Winter is a great time to get your summer AC situation figured out,28
17350,yhis54,Danivelle,You're very welcome!,3
17351,yhis54,babynurse2021,I bought an inflatable pool and sat in it all summer when I was pregnant during a PNW summer.,8
17352,yhis54,Amiedeslivres,"Ooh yes. My first pregnancy was in Portland, and I was due in mid-July during what was then the hottest summer on record.

If you don’t have AC (like lots of Cascadia folk), plan to buy a little unit, or set a tray of ice in front of a box fan like my Oklahoma grandmother did. That saved me, those last couple weeks of pregnancy when I could barely move or breathe in the oppressive heat.",2
17353,yhis54,NewHautness,My mom always likes to complain that I was born in November in Florida. But she forgets my daughter was born in early September in Florida. I don't wish that level of sweat on anyone lol.,2
17354,yhis54,Danivelle,"I have an late October, late July and early September so I've spent three summers being miserably hot and uncomfortable. Shaved Ice is a life and sanity saver as are pools.",1
17355,yhis54,cellists_wet_dream,"No doubt about it. Any line, no matter how faint, is a positive. Just like a COVID test but way better!!",39
17356,yhis54,eeeebbs,My (now) 3 year old was as faint as your first test! hahaha,5
17357,yhis54,proteins911,I might have thought the top one was indent. The one under it is definitely pink though! Congratulations:),5
17358,yhis54,DumpedChick22,how many days after IUI did it turn positive,2

17363,yhis54,CaptFoxtrot,If you're counter butter then I'm butter flavored oil bc I'm too soft to do it even once,25

17365,yhis54,CopperPegasus,"Thank you. It's just been sh!t after sh!t and now our beloved pupper seems to have gone partially blind near overnight, looks like he's been developing diabetes- I just want to sit down and give up, so the smile was very appreciated!",4

Congratulations, and may you be eternal couch buddies, may you always share your food (even if it’s *ril* good food), may you forever bicker over what to watch, may you always have plenty of blankets for when one is cold and the other is hot, may you always laugh like idiots over things only the two of you will ever think is funny while the rest of us think you’re insane, and may you be the very best of friends forever.

I have an enormous piece wrapped around my right thigh. Before I got that piece, I had an enormous burn scar wrapped around my right thigh. Boiling oil, very ugly story. Very ugly scar. Very beautiful tattoo.

Sometimes, tattoos are how you heal. And whatever you have to do to heal, you know we're all behind you, one minute at a time.

There’s no way to explain to people who don’t want to understand what you’ve been through, so you have to do what’s right for you. My oldest daughter was in a catastrophic car accident with multiple major injuries, one was a brain injury with memory loss. She tattooed an entire arm with her (our) pet’s faces, opposite forearm had her siblings names. It was therapeutic for her, and a way for her to feel like she wouldn’t forget. You did something to move forward from a bad relationship, there are many who struggle with that. Be proud of your strength and don’t ever forget how determined you are to create a new path for yourself. I’m proud of you, as we all are!  Hugs and love ❤️",1

If I’m interpreting this correctly, I see that this is Medusa and she is widely symbolized for in her tale she stands up against SA and those of us wear her as a badge of honor (of sorts) as we are now freed from our abusers. 

I mention the above because if that is true, I also want to say (again) that I’m proud of you for getting out and becoming the strong person you are today. I’m not sure if you’re from the US, but with all that has been going on, we need to stick together and your tattoo honestly gives me more inspiration and motivation to stand up against the transgressions that are happening. We have a voice, we are strong, and we can put an end to it.

Last year I tattooed the friends couch and “I’ll be here for you” as my commitment to help my friends in need that may be emotionally struggling cause I felt I had healed from the self harm stage of my life.

17615,vhgx6r,pfudorpfudor,"Thank you all so much for the support and beautiful comments! Genuinely started to tear up at some. 

For clarification, my mom types sloppily through text all the time. English isn't her first language but despite being highly educated she types like this i guess because she was just thought dumping or something? It gets worse when she switches between languages mid sentence and she won't even accent her words. 

We are an Eastern European family, so big on caring about what other people think, stoicism, high expectations, etc. When her mother came to visit I was given a whole speech about how I need to keep my gender and drag stuff to myself, how she won't understand, she made it sound like I'd give her a heart attack and when I said as much she said I might. She asked what I plan on doing with the rest of my family and she got really concerned when I said ""transition"" while explaining that I planned on just showing up one day transitioned and not say anything. Though in reality I really want to just never see anyone again 

It just feels so awful finally figuring out who you are, especially after years of dissociating, only to be told that I need to be hidden.",313

Also can you get some distance from your mom? Is that something you can afford to do, whether by going low contact or stopping contact entirely? Because you sound amazing, and dang am I impressed by your epic rainbow coord, and there's no need to devote your energy to someone who doesn't see how awesome you are.

I don’t want to assume you are on hormones but just wanted to say I’ve never heard of loosing your hair because of hormones. (But I’m not a doctor).

If she wants you to block photos on social media, go ahead and block HER on social media. Anyone who ""wants to speak their mind"" but doesn't want a conversation after the fall out of what they put out into the world is a narcissist, and you don't deserve that.",3
17644,vhgx6r,KimiMcG,"""Even a blind chicken gets a kernel"" Seriously, what a great sense of humor.  You look fabulous.  I would suggest (cause Mom's got to) is next time you wear that outfit, we should get you some rainbow shoe laces to match the skirt.

I’m probably not old enough to be your mom but man do I have the love for it. Sadly, a lot of people believe what the far right is saying about trans people. But it’s affecting real people. 

Trust me, no one dressed that well can be “unwell” lmao.

I hope you have trusted friends and perhaps a therapist, cause this world is hard and when you’re going through any changes, or strife from loved ones, like, my therapist has been amazing. I understand it’s not possible for everyone to find or afford one tho.",3

It does sound like your Mom is worried, but might be drawing conclusions based on misinformation. I honestly don't know if she's being rational or not. She may be misguided. She also may be uncomfortable with you presenting yourself due to her insecurity. My mother has in the past said similar things and she was projecting a lot.",9

Try not to let the words of your biological parents get to you, it seems like they don't want to understand how you feel. Especially the nagging and attempts at ruining your confidence.

Edit: I just read the messages more carefully. I don't think your mom has Alzheimer's. She is sincerely worried about you and she needs to GET OVER HER INTERNALIZED MISOGYNY!!!

Please, you can let her know, I'm transmasc just like you and I do NOT use T, because I prefer to be a visibly successful AFAB person who doesn't need drugs in order to be taken seriously.

The best thing I can say is: lots of hugs for you! You're awesome! You're overcoming a massive struggle, you're reflecting on yourself and choosing the life you want to live. That's strong as heck. You're an inspiration for others. And try to see and embrace the love and support of your chosen family and friend surrounding you at times like this.

17678,vhgx6r,MrLukacs,"I've been on T for 3 years now and out as trans for 6. While my parents are great now with my pronouns, name & calling me their son to other people- it took a REALLY LONG TIME for them to get to that point. I had been thinking about my gender identity for many years before I told them, but from their point of view it happened overnight. I was lucky enough to have physical space from them while I transitioned, but it took about a year of 'grey rock'ing them before we were ready to rebuild our relationship.
The beginning is the hardest. You're just starting this journey and will have to convince so many people that you know what you're doing. Be firm in your beliefs, but gentle with your feelings. Only you know what's best for you. Feel free to reach out if you need to vent",2

17691,vhgx6r,KFelts910,"Momma here. First of all- whatever makes *you* happy is something I fully support. Even if I don’t understand it, agree with it, or maybe would do things differently. Because a mother’s love is not conditional. As long as you are comfortable in your own skin, feeling fulfilled and living your best life, what more could a mom want?

You look incredible. Serious David Bowie vibes and I’m in love with it. Remember that sometimes it’s better to be loved than to be right. Remember that because the next time you get told “sometimes I’m right” you can remind them that if being right is more important than love, they stand to alienate themselves further. 
**Comment about grammar and spelling removed- I don’t want to perpetuate any shame towards those who take on English as another language and having seen the clarification, the comment is no longer relevant**

You moved out and are taking care of yourself. That’s an incredible feat. Be judicious with your time and firm with your boundaries. You can love your parents from afar. You’re not obligated to put your own mental health at risk, in the name of being a good child. So don’t. The love you deserve and the love you have received are not compatible. Stick with your tribe- be the truest you that you can be, unapologetically. Because this mom is so fucking proud of you.",2

Second of all and more importantly, you don't owe your mother any explanation and the fact you provided one is more than she deserves. She knows what she and your father did to hurt you.

It’s been years and years. I’m on testosterone and I have a beard, and they still say stuff about me. I understand how you feel, and you know yourself better than anyone else.

It might be a good idea to just cut them out...   
Yeah, they're family, but you can't chose who you're related to, and sometimes, they just happen to be unaccepting... and you should think of yourself, before you think of them.

17724,vhgx6r,CAPTCHA_is_hard,"Everything about your makeup and outfit is INCREDIBLE. You could be on the cover of Vogue magazine. I'm sorry your mom doesn't understand what being trans is, nor that the official treatment recommended by the medical community is gender-identigy-confirming hormones and surgeries. You know yourself and what is right for you. She may think she knows what is best, but her judgment is totally clouded by bigotry and by her own desires of how you should conform.

I know that you want her to change, but it may be super slow or it may never come at all. I feel like staying in contact with her is continuing to harm you. You should consider going low contact or no contact with her for the next few years and just focus on getting to know yourself and getting therapy to navigate that process and to heal from the hatred you've received. It is not your job to fix her or placate her. Your only job is to be happy and healthy. And your mom may no longer have a place in those things. 

I'm so sorry, but we all love you and support you here. I hope you have an amazing Price Month despite everything! Hold your LGBTQ friends extra tight for me!",2

17754,vhgx6r,ktbug1987,"Yoooo your eye make up is on point! 

My family still struggles with my gender identity (non-binary) and I haven’t even told them I started T (I have lupus which complicates everything and I don’t want them blaming flares on T — I didn’t even start T until recently after finishing chemo for a bad flare and I did so with the full knowledge of my medical team, but I still worry they will blame it). When I was home last I was hairless from chemo and my mom insisted on telling everyone I was her daughter and just didn’t have hair because I went through chemo and it mostly fell out so I shaved it completely bald to not be patchy. It’s coming back now but I think I will keep it short. Anyway I have some idea of what this is like and what I can say is that you’re doing the right thing going to Pride. Over time you will build a queer family and they will be your rock and you will have a place to be your full self and it’s in that place you will no longer feel like a part of you is zipped away in the painful confines of a dark closet. Closet is a good metaphor but maybe it’s more like casket. Or one of those walk in freezers. Anyway you don’t need to place parts of you in that dark cold place for anyone. You deserve to be out, to be free, to be happy, to be you. It gets better.

Im 34 and live in another state from my family. Big parts of me miss them but at least as it relates to this, the distance can be helpful in mediating when and how I engage with these perspectives.",2

17780,vhgx6r,wittycleverlogin,"You look super cute from head to toe. I’m glad pride was good for you and to you!

You literally ARE going through adolescence, between the hormones and growing into yourself. 

I honestly didn’t even make it through half of that toddler version of a glued together ransom note. Both because she/it sucks and because it is not even readable. Was she on a codeine trip when she was smashing the keyboard?

It may be time to take a break from the parents and put them on an info diet. Not everyone deserves the VIP pass to access you as a person. 

I’m guessing she saw that on fb, either unfriend her or lockdown her access to nothing. Be aware other family may try to show her stuff so any fencesitting fam might need to go into the same info diet group as her. I don’t want to sound dismissive and like this isn’t hard or upsetting, but if she stops being awful it’s going to be under her own steam and on her own time. Don’t give her the ammunition to fuck with you and treat you like this. 

I’m straight but from my perspective the alphabet mafia tends to be very good at creating the urban tribe and the chosen family. I hope you can find some comfort in that fact and can eventually find your people and your family. 💕",2

I have a narcissistic bio!mom, too. I don’t speak to her because she’s like this. Disengage. You will likely feel some guilt, a lingering “I can’t do that, she’s my mom, what if I break her heart” kind of feeling. It’s hard. It goes away. When you realize you’re doing so much better than you were, when your phone buzzes in your pocket one afternoon and your stomach *doesn’t* drop in dread because it *could* be her?

I love the shoes you paired with the clothes, the skirt is to die for and I want one, the way you styled your shirt is so cute, and don’t even get me started on your makeup. LOVE. I love the whole thing and you look gorgeous! 

Ok, onto the crux of the issue. I grew up in a family like this. “What will people think” was how my family lived. I felt stifled; I couldn’t be myself. At my worst, I felt like I was suffocating. 

It wasn’t until I stopped caring about “what will people think” that I finally felt free to live my life. And that applied to what my own family would think. I did not care who it was, blood or not, I did not care. I hit my breaking point and said fuck it and just started being me. 

Nothing I say can make up for the pain that having parents like this causes. All I can do is be as supportive as possible. So just know that I will gladly be your older queer sister and be there for you whenever you need. 

This internet stranger loves you and is SO PROUD of who you are and who you will grow to be. You keep being you, no matter what. You are amazing and wonderful and fabulous just as you are. That is your power and no one can take that away from you. 💜",3
17837,vhgx6r,Elon_is_musky,"Sibling here, I’m so proud of you for standing up for yourself & your happiness, it’s not an easy thing to do! Many people (in your mother’s generation nonetheless) spend their ENTIRE LIVES being unhappy & staying in the closet because they were worried what others will think. They had to kill a part of themselves just to appear “normal” & it’s so amazing that we don’t live in that time anymore & can be who we are🥰you deserve happiness. You deserve to feel at home in your body. Human bodies are not perfect, & if you need to get it right then that’s perfectly fine & healthy! 

People love to say “hormones are bad for your body” but what’s worse is the stress & depression that comes with not feeling “right” in your body. What’s worse is the increase likelihood of suicide because of that, & hormone therapy is perfectly fine when done correctly! I’m so glad you have the opportunity to get on T, & I’ve heard that 2nd puberty thing SUCKS but the fact that you’re happier WITH IT shows that it’s the right choice.

I’m sorry your mom doesn’t see it that way, but I am so proud that you’re putting your happiness before her ignorance 🖤 and happy Pride!!",3

My child has struggled with her gender identity, and, while I don't understand it completely, they know that I am here for them no matter what and they will always have my unwavering support. 

I am sorry that your parents don't understand or support you. All the moms here do.  I hope that, in this month of pride, you are proud of yourself.  I am.  ❤️",3
17842,vhgx6r,Phidwig,"Having concerns about taking hormones is legit. Long term use can lead to a whole host of health issues. It sounds like she is genuinely worried about you, but I know how frustrating it is when a parent turns genuine concern into a condescending, toxic, bid for control. It can feel like total madness. It’s often both things at the same time - real concern, and a pattern of trying to control.

I know you probably don’t want to hear this, but gender dysphoria often can be healed through years of the right kind of therapy. It would be awful if you did irreversible damage to your body now and then want to detransition later in life. There actually is a growing number of detrans people talking about these issues, but you won’t hear about them or from them because they get silenced and exiled from the trans community, which, sorry to say, does often exhibit cult like behavior. (Love bombing, telling people to cut out anyone in their life that has differing perspectives, and discarding anyone who veers even slightly away from strictly following the ideology… just a few examples). 

I know what I’m saying is a very unpopular opinion with young people right now. I’m in my 30s so I’m not too old, but I have been around long enough to see this trans movement explode and become a trendy social contagion. There’s a lot of youth who unfortunately are getting swept up in the fad and will regret any permanent decisions made later in life. And of course everyone thinks that will never be them. 

Expressing your masculine side without the use of hormones is totally a beautiful awesome thing. Exploring gender fluidity and dressing up and experimenting are all healthy ways of getting to know who you are and finding your true self. I support that! It’s just the hormones and surgery that can be dangerous and can cause major, potentially devastating physical and psychological issues later in life. 

Btw, you look awesome and super happy in the pic, I’m glad you’re feeling good. You deserve to feel good! I’m just trying to give some context to what I think your mom is getting at.",6

17858,vhgx6r,ThaneOfCawdorrr,"This mom accepts you exactly as you are, honey.  

If I can offer some advice?  Your mom's writing seems like almost pure-play stream-of-consciousness random anxiety.  My advice is not to engage with her.  She simply doesn't understand, she's afraid and worried about something she doesn't understand, and you just can't have a dialogue with someone in that state.   Try to just disengage as much as possible.   Put all your energy into your own self-actualization and exploring and discovering who you are.   It will feel so much better and so much more powerful.   

We all want, deep down, our mom to love us.  If it's any weird consolation, I feel like she does actually love you, she just literally is in a panic state and can't understand what's happening, and what I hope, for you, that this means, is that eventually she will be able to calm down and come to some kind of understanding.  It may take years--and do NOT wait for her--and it will only happen long after she realizes you ARE your true self and you're happy and strong-- but if it gives you any hope, down the line, that moment may come.   My mom and I were almost completely estranged for many many years, but in her last few years, we actually became close again and she was finally able to say that she appreciated me, or at least get close to that.  It was such a gift.  I wish the same for you.",1

People are shunned, maybe she’s worried that you’ll be harassed or about your safety in the community. Wish people would approach subjects with compassion and understating. She said you were gorgeous. I think your mom is trying, try too or risk severing* the relationship. Best of luck to you",1

I'm not very good at taking care of myself at all actually. And I don't accept help from people. I barely eat. I snack throughout the day and usually have one meal. Maybe two but one is probably smaller. I somehow manage to get away with not showering up to a week sometimes if it's bad enough. And here is where I'm dependent on them too. I want to make plans but I have my emotional support dog and no friends who could help dogsit. I already feel like I neglect her because I'm gone all day for work, at some point I take a nap, she has no interest in playing 95% of the time since we moved (today she fetched four times though, I'm very proud). So on the weekends I reunite her with the family dog, who brought her back from a depressive episode after the last family dog passed. I don't know what I'm going to do in the future when they're inseparable, I can't live without her, my parents won't let me take him, I don't think I could take care of him and his needs, I don't know if I could afford it, but I'd miss him so much too.

Every other lecture he'd say how one out of four people in this room will get cancer. Then a few years ago they found that like 70% of cancers are just totally random, 20ish% and 10% genetics or environment/habits can't remember which is which.

17926,vhgx6r,ButtBattalion,"While hormones carry the risks you are talking about here, it has been proven time and again that the absolute best treatment for gender dysphoria is transitioning. I understand that you're erring on the side of caution, but from what I understand that is part of the process in acquiring hormones for this very purpose - at least where I'm from. You are explicitly and repeatedly told the risks from endocrinologists and it can take a while to get the wheels in motion. And while those risks aren't ever going to completely go, it seems to be that they're outweighed by the risks of conversion therapy (not sure if I'm right in saying that what you're suggesting is specifically conversion therapy, but I can't think of any other interpretation given the info I have.

Here's some scientific literature which, to broadly summarise, suggest that transitioning is the best treatment for dysphoria, that transgender people who are socially accepted have mental health outcomes no worse than the general population, and that regret is not a significant factor post-transition:

**""We conducted a systematic literature review of all peer-reviewed articles published in English between 1991 and June 2017 that assess the effect of gender transition on transgender well-being. We identified 55 studies that consist of primary research on this topic, of which 51 (93%) found that gender transition improves the overall well-being of transgender people, while 4 (7%) report mixed or null findings. We found no studies concluding that gender transition causes overall harm. As an added resource, we separately include 17 additional studies that consist of literature reviews and practitioner guidelines. This search found a robust international consensus in the peer-reviewed literature that gender transition, including medical treatments such as hormone therapy and surgeries, improves the overall well-being of transgender individuals.

If it weren't for money and the dogs Id cut my family off :/ My dog is an ESA and she's best friends with the family dog and they won't let me have him plus I don't think I'd be able to take care of both but I hate separating them. I bring my dog to their house every weekend so they can hang out together. And then of course money. I need them to pay for grad school (culturally parents pay for children's education) and they help with my rent and some extra financial help. I wish I could win the lottery, give a chunk to them for their troubles and for what they spent on me, then just go on my way disappearing with both dogs.",3

I prefer they/them but she/her doesn't make me dysphoric, especially when I'm in drag. I'm more euphoria driven than dysphoric, which is lucky. The main source of dysphoria is when I'm treated in some way that is exclusive to women and that the person would treat me different if I weren't a woman. I wish I was born assigned male at birth and I've said since I was a teen that ""I wish I was born a man who dressed as a woman."" I don't really feel like a binary guy, but the vibe of when a man is feminine is perceived differently than when a woman is feminine. My main goal is androgyny. Lately people have been having a hard time pinpointing my assigned gender, especially given my voice lately, and that gives me loads of euphoria. So I'm on low dose T so that the changes are gradual and I can gauge what effect I'm liking or not.",83

What tools/path/etc do you need to accomplish financial independence? 

As someone that yeeted a HUGE chunk of family out of my life many many years ago, it was the healthiest thing I could do for me. Being in contact with them was hurting me, but I had to think about those 3 questions a LOT, and work toward that goal so that I could walk way.",11

17954,vhgx6r,Fartknocker500,"Yeah. I sometimes wonder if society wasn't so fucked up, that we have had queer and trans folk around *forever.* Just now they feel safe enough to stand up and be who they are publicly. I wonder if people would be more understanding if we had been more accepting sooner? Maybe in the coming years it will just *be.*

Personally speaking I don't spend a lot of time worrying about how people choose to live their lives. I figured out when I was young that people who can't embrace who they are live miserable lives, so I set out to be as loving and accepting as I could, just loving what *is.* My son's gf is trans and I love her like my own daughter. I have many other kids who aren't mine by birth, but I'm who they call if they need help.

So many people, including myself, have mental health issues. You're not alone. You happen to be queer *and* have mental health issues.....one has little to nothing to do with the other, I am straight and have mental health issues. I feel like the queer community is *so much better* at dealing with their mental health because they are so open about everything in life, including that. I have learned *so much* from my queer friends. I feel so fortunate to have them in my life.

It may take time for your mom to understand. Hopefully she will eventually. One big thing I learned about life is that you can only love people for who they are. You can ask them for what you want from them, but they sometimes can't give it. Human beings are so complicated. *But* you can control how you react and deal with her. You are who you are meant to be, and that is *so very* courageous. If I was your mom I would be proud. I am proud and I'm not even your mom! Haha!",2

17969,vhgx6r,pfudorpfudor,"I don't have a great support system right now. I have friends i text but most of them live far away. I don't have any friends i hang out with regularly. I had a therapist but then I grew out of my parents' insurance and she became out of network. I haven't had a therapist in the past few months because I was having trouble finding one, then I got a new job and my insurance doesn't kick in until next month. 

Financially idk. I'm making more money at this new job but with benefits being as expensive as they are (especially when you need the gold health plan) it's not that much higher than I was making before. I don't know what more I can do to become financially independent, especially when I dopamine seek a lot via retail therapy. I actually lost all my savings during the pandemic because I was doing very poorly after a string od tragedies in 2020 and I used online shopping to cope so I screwed up there.

My company is opening an office in Pittsburgh and I've indulged in the fantasy of moving. I have a lot of friends there who would help. But I just moved to this new apartment and lease isn't up until October, money is still an issue as well as the dogs :/",5

I'm on low dose T so that the changes are gradual and I can gauge what effects I want and if I like the process that's happening. My goal is to be more androgynous so my appearance looks genderly ambiguous",3
17978,vhgx6r,pfudorpfudor,"Thanks so much! I really put a lot of thought into the outfit to balance out gender presentation. If I changed one thing I had to change others to balance things out. It was a mess lol. 

I always joke that my gender is whichever bathroom has the shortest line. Sometimes it's a porter potty",26
17979,vhgx6r,pfudorpfudor,"No not at all I loved hearing your experience! 
And it's important to note that not everyone outside the binary looks androgynous. You have girly men and you have butch women and then everything else in the four dimensions of gender (Kate Bornstein, fascinating stuff!) But yeah definitely make no assumptions on gender! Phobes make it sound like we'll rip your head off if you slip up and that's not true. For the most part, it might sting but we know you didn't know, we lay it out, and now we're good. You may make mistakes here and there but as long as you are well intentions and you handle being corrected properly (say thank you and move on). The misgendering that sucks and is when people use it as an insult, as a slur, mock us for defending ourselves, turning every gender an insult whether you look like a man or you throw like a girl or what gender is it. It's disgusting 

Sorry, went in a little rant there lol 

Thank you so much. I don't feel confident often, only in these spaces and I wish I had them more often",10
17980,vhgx6r,SummerPoppies,"Okay yes grey rocking is about to be your new best friend! Grey or gray rocking is a variation on an information diet where you just reply simply, and then if you want add in topic change. You become Boring. And you should ideally talk to a therapist about the strategy, because long term it's not the most fun, but for right now it's a tool in your arsenal. (Also seriously topic changes are POWERFUL. They likely just want to talk about themselves anyway, so asking 'so hey what's up with your dogs/the garden/that politician you hate' is probably plenty to get them to stop insulting you half as much.)

And the resources on r/raisedbynarcissists will likely be helpful, but as a heads up some are old, ableist, and even cishetnormative, but they still have some helpful gems in there. (Like Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft is an excellent read if you haven't read it already, but wow is it meant for straight couples.) Best of luck!",15

Financially and with the rest, you do what you need to do. If you need to deal with them still for a bit, that’s ok.

And one day, maybe, you'll wake up and think, ""Oh, didn't I have that app that I used to keep track of the days?"" and realise that you don't need it anymore. :)",3

18027,vpr13i,Illustrious_Satanist,"Congrats baby! 
When I was younger my parents did the countdown to see how long I would last without cutting. The days added on and the pressure built and I did break my streak. Don’t be ashamed if you fall behind or you slip up. Just focus on being happy. It took me years to stop harming myself. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Patience comes with time and learning more about yourself and finding a good support group. Don’t be upset if you slip up. Just take care of yourself baby 
Love you! You’re doing so great tho! 1000 days is amazing! Keep loving yourself",3

Something I heard on the radio recently. ""There are things worth doing poorly"". We're always told to do things well. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself. So whenever you're too tired to workout for 30 minutes today, work out for 10. If you're depressed today and don't feel like being in the sunshine for an hour, sit out there for 10 minutes. There are things in life that are still worth doing even if it means not pushing yourself so hard to do everything well some days. Things worth doing are worth doing poorly. 

Find things that allow yourself a mental break. Don't ever give up.",2

18225,wotzs6,JessFluoresce,"Hi mum,

I saw the title of this post and wrote out a whole chunk of text but then the picture loaded and I just can't seem to post it now.

I'm glad you're finally checking in with me. It makes me hope you actually want to listen and take responsibility for your actions.

I was that kid, mum. I was the good kid. Praised for it by you and everyone else in the family while we were outside. You would say things like ""you're such a good girl outside, shame about when we get in the house, you turn into a monster"" and then in the next breathe say ""you're a good kid really"".

I tried to be a good kid in the beginning, I really did. Even now at 25, I just want to be a good kid deep down. But you never listened to me. You never listened to my thoughts and feelings about how you behaved. How gran behaved. How awful and toxic the family dynamic was. How I wanted to be treated the same way I tried to treat you. But you didn't want to listen. It was all ""you have to earn respect"" and it seems like I'm always in the process of ""earning"" everybodies respect but never actually getting it fully.

And then I gave up trying to be the good kid. You lay into me enough times for being ""bad"" that I decided I would fulfill that prophecy. Not in a really bad way, just in a way you don't like. I'm working on not being a doormat anymore mum. I'm working on myself with therapy and I think I'm finally getting somewhere. I have an amazing, supportive partner who listens to me and isn't going anywhere. And I am reaching out/opening up to my friends more. Plus, I have communities like this one if I ever need them.

I think you're proud of me, in you're own way. And in my own way I'm still that good kid. I'm just trying to find who that kid is now, that's all.

I love and miss you mumma. I wish I could just pick up the phone and tell you all this, and technically I can, but I don't want to. You'd just see it as a personal attack anyway. Thanks for checking in though, it means the world to me ❤",7

The ""mass"" went away, the symptoms continued, and we thought it was because of the mass (that we didn't know wasn't there anymore).  He'd been sick since April, so his body was worn out from fighting and he had given up.  We didn't find out there was no mass until his appt. to be pts.  I feel so guilty, even though I know we did the best we could with the information we were given by the other vet.  We did get an apology from the head vet at the place that misdiagnosed him (that vet didn't, but one of her employees did) and she said that she'd personally look into what happened.  We have 8 other cats, one of them being the littermate of the one we had to pts.  It's so hard sometimes to look at her because she looks so much like him.

18238,wotzs6,inheritedhypocrisy,"I tried so hard, and it never seemed to be good enough.

Turns out my entire body was defective the entire time, and everything was tangibly more difficult for me because I wasn't made the same way as you were. I couldn't do things the same way you did, but I made myself do them anyways because not doing them wasn't an option. I made myself into someone who doesn't feel pain because so many things hurt all the time, and you never really seemed to care so obviously it wasn't a big deal. I can't remember the last time I felt comfortable in my own skin, not aching and tired and distinctly aware of every bone shifting as I do things.

I thought I was morally defective, lazy and unmotivated and constantly complaining about everything. It's funny in hindsight when I know I barely even allowed myself to have emotions at all because your emotions were always bigger than mine. Even now, you get upset and anxious about things that I didn't say, things that you only heard in your own head. I dont care if you don't do things or if you forget things or even if you are upset and can't manage it on your own. I just don't want you to yell at me anymore. Or around me, even. Is that so much to ask?

Momma, I'm so tired. There's just so much that I have to adjust to now, and it's gratifying to know that it wasn't my fault, but I'm also buried so deeply in grief. Grief for who I used to be, for who I used to think I was. I thought I was crazy. I thought I deserved it. I thought I was less than human, somehow, this ugly, selfish creature who didn't deserve nice things. 

I can't take back the years I spent thinking these things, or get rid of the paths they wore in my brain overnight. I cant go back and tell myself that it's okay, that it's not in my head, that there will be people who will care one day. Even now, I can't say that I love myself, or even that I'm proud of myself. I'm lukewarm about my existence, about who I am, which is so much better than the self hatred I used to bury myself in, but goddamn it's so hard to try to see myself through clear eyes, without hearing your voice when you said I was a bad student or a pessimist or that I wasn't trying hard enough. 

I feel like it's all I can think about, partially because im reminded of it every time I move because every part of my body is involved. It's this constant reminder that there is something wrong with me and there always has been, but you never noticed because you always assume the worst of me. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this, but I just needed to put this somewhere. I really appreciate this forum and all that you guys do. I can't express how thankful I am for the responses I've gotten here when I was working through some of my worst moments.",3

I have a lot of assignments due soon for uni and it’s stressing me out; my days have been very busy lately and I haven’t really had time to just sit down and get the work done. This afternoon’s clear in my schedule after a class so I’m going to make some tea, put on my lofi, and dive in.

And! My abusive roommate is moving out in the next few days. I’m really excited for this, I’ve been living in a constant state of anxiety for the last few months. Every time I walk up to my apartment I feel my heartbeat go way up, I get nauseous and panicky and such a strong feeling of dread. It’ll be nice to not have to feel that way any more.

I’ve been putting time into ‘reclaiming my space’; he provided a fair chunk of the communal furniture so I’ve been replacing it even though he hasn’t finished removing his yet. I bought a new side table with a lamp for the hallway, and a new coffee table. I also got a new towel hook, blue bathmat, and blue doormat. They’re little things, but they make me so happy. Everything’s in blue and white and light wood tones, which are just so beautiful to me. All my roommate’s furniture is black.

Last night one of my amazing friends helped me pick up a free couch + armchair I found on Facebook. He helped me carry them up to the third floor, because he’s awesome, and the whole thing only cost me buying him a burrito as thanks. The couches are beautiful, really soft and squishy, and I’ve got the armchair set up in the corner by the window to make a little reading nook. Once my roommate gets his couch out, the space will be perfect.

I’ve decided to live on my own for a month or two so I can enjoy the company of myself and my cat, and so I can stop flinching every time I hear a sound like keys jingling.

The only other complication is that my lease is ending soon and I’m scared the landlord won’t renew because I have a cat. I have to tell them about her because my roommate’s threatened to tell them anyway. I’ve moved five times since the start of 2020, I really don’t want to have to do it again. Especially not in the middle of my final exams.

Thanks to anyone who read all this, it’s been nice to write it down and get all the thoughts straight. No matter what happens, I know things will be okay with time.

Not doing too great over here. Graduated with honours but I can’t find a job, and my own mom moved to France for work but is so overworked I don’t want to burden her. I’m thinking of moving over there with my boyfriend to help her out, which is very exciting but also very scary!

And then last week we found out two of my grandparents have cancer. My grandmother has only weeks to live and I just lost my other grandmother to cancer back in March and I just can’t. Its too much. 
I want everyone to stop dying and I want everything to not change. I’m almost 30 now and I feel like I should be able to deal with this, but all I want to do is hide in my bed. But I can’t. My cats and boyfriend need me too so O get up everyday and do everything I need to do but jeez, I’m so tired of everything always hurting all the time. Just reading all these stories made me bawl.",2
18271,wotzs6,INeedsAHugToo,"Hey Momma Ducks, I'm kinda mixed on how I'm doing. I lost my job, and while I liked a lot about my job and the steady money was good, it didn't pay nearly enough and I'm so introverted that even just taking care of one person was too much for me a lot of the time. My YouTube channel started growing fast at the same time and I've joined an awesome community around that kind of content, but I'm making a lot more content and pressuring myself because I don't want to disappoint my supporters. And I started trying out a food delivery thing to make some money while I get the YouTube thing going, but it's so new and different and I have this mix of excitement and anxiety because it seems like it CAN be a good thing, even if I do live on the edge of nowhere so I can't use a lot of the advice for making really good money, but it's a real struggle here getting started. And I'm always busy with not enough mental health time, and I have both scheduling and introvert and social anxiety issues so I can't see my friends, and I haven't had an in-person hug or anything like that in over a month and I'm scared I'm going to end up like I was when hugs and things only happened a couple times a year. And after writing all that, I feel like I'm not doing so well. I'm really stressed and lonely and I wish my mom were still alive so I could hug her and tell her about my bad days.

&#x200B;

I hope you're doing well, Momma Ducks, and my fellow ducklings as well. Thanks for the space to vent, I really appreciate it. Now to drink some tea and put on a happy face for recording time.",2

I told her, “I didn’t know” because I didn’t, no one had ever asked me. My mom got me a small pack almost 2 years ago and I had used them sparingly. She asked what soap, shampoo, and conditioner I wanted (those I did know). For the first time in my entire 16 years, for the first time with any of my 4 parents… someone had gone out of their way to say, “hey, I’m *going* to be getting these for you, what would you prefer”.

I still get so resentful and angry that I have to unlearn all of this junk they taught me; like I want someone to fully care for all my needs for once, you know? My Husband is great but it is more like our needs aren't aligning at times now so it adds a layer (sometimes he needs emotional support but I'm zapped and vice versa).

My biological father always said ""your brothers were always so exhausting, always having trouble in school. But you weren't, you were the ""Selbstläufer""*-child so I didn't have to take care of you"" 

To explain, ""Selbstläufer"" is german, literally translates to ""self-runner"" and google translates it to ""self-perpetuating"". It means when a project or plan is so good that it will definitely be a success without putting much work in it.

This word isn't typically used for humans and as an adult I think its horrible to say that to a child.

My dad helped me clean up my bunnies cage in the garage. It was dark outside, cold, I was exhausted and had a headache. I think he breated me a lot and was mad at me for taking so long and doing some things wrong, I don't remember. I know he seemed mad and strict at that moment. When I came back in, my mom asked if everything was alright, and I just bursted into tears. I never talked to them about my problems as a teenager (when I could prevent it), so this just felt really embarassing. As If I was weak and shouldn't act like that. 

My mom is always really sweet when I show emotions (which was twice, this one time included), so I'm not sure why I don't want to show them to my parents. My father is a good man, very funny and open, but used to get mad quickly. He'd understand too, but I have never really talked about emotional things with him.

 I think I just learned to not show my emotions out of several small reasons... it's difficult to dissect my past and present family problems and pinpoint what exactly caused what, cause it was a lot of subtle things and just not actively caring enough.

So being perfect and having no needs became my identity. It carried on as I started my career. And in the end it nearly killed me- I gave everything I had, til there was nothing left, and still they wanted more. Every aspect of my life just kind of collapsed when I hit my breaking point.

I didn’t even REALIZE this until I was in therapy after my breakdown. The pieces suddenly fell into place, explained so much about me. My parents don’t know- I don’t need them having guilt over them doing the best they could.

A lot of the stress I had has gone down a little bit since I came out as trans, and I'm working towards becoming the woman I've always been but it's hard, and it's going to take a long time. I went to the state fair yesterday and I wore a pink shirt under a blue hoodie because it's the colors of the transgender pride flag 🏳️‍⚧️ and a pin on my hat that says ""She/Her"" and I introduced myself to people I've never met as Gloria. I was mainly nervous because if someone did recognize those colors and didn't like trans people because of the myths and rumors they've heard about trans people they might try and confront me, and I'm already dealing with a lot.  It did feel really good to go as my genuine self, but I definitely do need to find a way to do some kind of therapy because I have a doctor to help with my body stuff but I don't have a doctor for my mind stuff.  I've started trying a dating app but that's a whole other thing because I don't even know my sexuality, and I've only ever told one person in my life about being sexually assaulted. It'll be probably at least three or four months before my hair starts to grow back if it does at all even with medication so that's a part of me I feel like I need to hide. And shaving my face every day or other day is awful.  I also feel like my mom feels responsible for making me cut my hair years ago, I had long hair and when I started to go bald at the age of 18 or so I buzzed it all off. I don't think she could have known that I was trans, or maybe I ""didn't show any signs"" because if I did then maybe there would be something ""wrong"" with me. I've been on HRT for 54 days and even looking back at pictures from April there is a noticeable change to my face, and also my chest has just started developing, which is crazy.  I know I am going to be uneven because the right side started about two weeks before the left but maybe TMI I have an actually palmable amount of booba. I feel like I'm a broken mess, but it's hard to work on myself when my whole life it's been ""oh I'm so worthless"" it's way easier to be miserable and get blackout drunk every night.

I couldn’t stand being touched, but what child has the ability to calmly say “please no hugs today”? And further still, what child is *respected* when they say these things?

I never made friends easily, and social interactions were a minefield of things I didn’t understand. A lot of times, I would get halfway through a conversation and realize I was being laughed at.. and not with. I was the butt of so many jokes. I was the chubby, happy, over-enthusiastic girl who wouldn’t pick up on it when what you said was really veiled insults.

And I’m scared to speak to my mother about this. She’s my best friend. I adore her, I idolize her. I love her without end. But I’m so scared she’ll wave off my concerns because I communicate well and show extreme empathy.

Why I struggle to do what feels like the most basic of adult things.. and if that’s taken from me, then what’s left? Am I really just lazy and entitled and too sensitive?

Reading your post, you make me realize today how I've kept my mouth shut about what I needed from my friends, and even from myself.

Most of my friends were very understanding of my needs and are respecting the boundaries very well. I'll see how to ""deal"" with that one friend who took my actions too personal later, giving this person some time to think and rest too. We will have some things to talk about in due time.

My day is almost boring, but boring feels very good for now. After weeks of anxiety attacks and trying to juggle with too many things, boring feels very good, quite relaxing.

I just can't talk to them about anything real pertaining to my life. I have never had parents that I knew I could turn to no matter what, unless I wanted to be mocked or at best be ignored.",1

18318,wotzs6,iamaliz,"I was proud to be ""the good kid"" until recently I realised I just moulded myself into whatever my parents wanted me to be, just did everything I was told and was idle (sitting in front of the computer for hours) when they didn't call on me.

No wonder I was depressed out of my mind. I do this to my partners too, just become whoever they want me to be and shut down when they leave. 

Only realised all this after moving out at 22, so glad I'm finding myself now! 

Still grateful for my real mom and internet moms too:)",1

My cousin died yesterday, so I asked a freind if we could met up today, and she said yes.  
Got to pet a cat, have a snake climb around on me, held a gecko and played Mario Kart.  
It was some good distraction.",1
18320,wotzs6,11eggoe,not that well unfortunately :( trying to heal from this is harder than I thought because I can’t suitable help. I’m not planning on giving up any time soon but it’s still a struggle every day. I’m trying to at least brighten other people’s life in the meantime until mine brightens again.,1

18323,wotzs6,mademoiselle_apple,"I messed it up with someone and I think it is related to this...

When I was younger we had so many troubles so in order to remain ""strong"" and not be another burden for my mother I, slowly but steady, learned how to hide my feelings. Basically I associated showing feelings with being ""wise, mature"" and not being a burden.

Fast foward to this day, I'm very confused when it comes to feelings and I still deny mine. So, there was this person who was very into me and I really liked him. However I was scared to show my feelings and how he was making me feel in general... so I foolishly pushed him away on Saturday. Basically told him I'm not ready for us and I didn't want to talk to him. And that's it, he accepted it and now he's gone. Already sent a couple of texts apologizing but it doesn't make it up for the horrible thing I did. I don't even know if he has seen my messages, if he will see them and ignore, or what is going to happen. I completly understand if he doesn't want anything to do with me. And I'm hating myself so much for hurting him. He's such a beautiful person, a ray of sunshine, super nice and cool. Some weeks ago he said I deserved a chance to be happy, we both deserve it. But I messed it up and now, there's the big chance I will never know. If I could give half of the life time I have remaning to go back and stop myself from saying such a foolery I would. I can only hope he isn't hurting as much as me and the weight of all this falls upon me. Because he deson't deserve it. If somehow he decides to forgive me and come back to me I'm giving it all. Not more aloofness, denying my feelings or not being 100% honest about them. 

Mom I'm so sad and heartbroken. This is just what I was avoiding by not allowing myself to ""feel"" and ignoring my feelings but the result was the same. Or worse. 

To others out there who are trying to repress your feelings, please don't. Cherish yourself but also cherish others. Call your significant other, family, friends, pets and tell them how much you appreciate them.",1

I just want a remote job to pay bills, I might have to settle for a gas station in town, but long Covid limits my stamina so much so I worry. Trying not to be discouraged, but you know how anxiety goes.

Just had a stressful weekend with a somewhat abusive friend so winding down from that too. Someday things will get better. I hope you're doing well, Mom.",1

18327,wotzs6,pintotakesthecake,"I wasn’t one of those kids at all. In fact, I pretended to be that kid while going along and doing my own thing until I got caught, while my mom was distracted by my more volatile, much less tractable older siblings. Unfortunately now I seem to be raising a sweet 13 year old to be like this. I don’t mean to, I want her to be able to stand up for herself and be independent and choose her life on her terms.  Unfortunately, we live in a blended family, and it’s been a definite adjustment mixing my style of parenting with my husbands’s.  He has his boundaries of acceptable behaviour and they are slightly different than mine (mostly related to the concept of backtalk and respect; I was allowed a large amount of leniency as a child in communications with my mother while he had a more traditionally strict upbringing).  I respect his boundaries and extend my own past where I might ordinarily allow them to rest, and I worry that this is stifling my elder child’s sense of self expression and self respect. Or maybe she’s just 13. Idk. And as my mother passed away long before my kids were born I really have no one to discuss this with, to gain perspective.  I love my little family and try and respect each member of it.  It’s very hard. It’s a balancing act, that weighs on me along with everything else I have to do. I just need a little motherly encouragement i think..",1

18334,wotzs6,RedVamp2020,"Honestly, this hurts reading. I was my mom’s favorite child because I never ‘needed’ anything and I was an over achiever. I have ADHD and had the opportunity to have access to medication when I was 9, but my mom took me off the meds because I became ‘weepy’. I understand she was having to deal with abuse from my dad and was probably having a hard time dealing with negative emotions, but it really did make a big impact on how I learned to control myself when I feel upset.

I’m trying so hard to make sure I don’t do that to my three kids. Some days, it’s much harder than others, but I’m actually trying. I apologize to my three year old, something I was never a recipient of, and my older two when I act out of line. I’m doing much better than I ever was, but I feel terrible right now because I lost my temper with my daughter a couple of days ago. I did something inexcusable, I over reacted about something so small… I never got taught how to control my anger in a healthy way, so it usually builds up and explodes. I just wish someone would have actually taught me how to deal with negativity when I was growing up.

And now I sincerely wish someone could give me a hug…😭😭",1
18335,wotzs6,Mia_B-P,"This post explains a lot of why I am the way I am. While I wasn't a quiet child, I did try to avoid disobeying my parents because my father was very impatient and overreacted when angry and frustrated.",1

18337,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Oh goodness no. If anything society failed to give you the stuff you need to succeed, like support and properly motivated achievements that you could really appreciate for yourself. But hey! Like any other time when someone in charge messed up, that just means that now, if you want it done right, you'll have to do it yourself. That's all those other people did, they were forcefully pushed to their limits, so they found what they could do sooner. That's all, but it's not enviable, I promise. They're just as miserable that no one let them relax and explore and discover stuff at their own pace or gave them help.

Creativity is just a survival instinct. You can cultivate yours at any time Duck. I promise. All it takes is risk. Proper, healthy, loving to yourself, risk. Just stretch your wings a little and you might be surprised how resilient they can be. And if not, a good mom is there to support you and cheer you on to try again.

You can be anything you want to be, that wasn't a lie. What they didn't tell you was the sacrifice and the work and the grueling effort it takes to get where you want to be. That's the part everyone kind of glosses over. That's why it's also okay to just appreciate what you have rather than chase something unsure. You just have to figure out what's enough for you. That's all. 💙",110

My dad was very impatient and I seem to remember being very needy, disobedient and bothersome but according to mom I was a very good child.

18346,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Yep that is brutal and please have a hug. It's exhausting trying to save anything that people are actively fighting you on. Take time for self-care in here just for a minute, so that you can get back to the fight out there. Have a virtual hug, get some sleep if you can. You won't be much help to anyone without rest.

Disassociate away Duckling, we're right here to anchor against when you're ready to come home. 💙🤗",15
18348,wotzs6,ScrembledEggs,"Personally I recommend requesting her to do research on what it means to be trans, and stories from trans people. Stories are important so she doesn’t go down any ‘sky daddy hates the gays’ rabbit holes. If you need to reduce or cut contact, even temporarily to give her space while she does her research and decides what kind of mother she wants to be, then please do. It might be hard but I think it’s a boundary you need to set. She’s deliberately causing you a lot of emotional turmoil and you deserve better than that. 

I’m also proud of you for knowing what’s going on in your mind while you typed this. Mindfulness and self-awareness are so important for being able to maintain our own balance.

You’re right, you will be okay. It might take some time, but you will. If you can, reach out to your support system and maintain those contacts. Friends make everything easier.",3

18351,wotzs6,deborah_jai,I can relate sib (sis?). Used to have at least an outwardly solid relationship with my parents until I realized I was queer. Came out to them in January and we’ve barely talked since. Looking forward to moving to cut contact even more.,3
18352,wotzs6,The_Clementine,Hey I'm almost the same. You have a great relationship as long as you conform to their ideal child. Good luck on the nightmares. The only thing that slowed them for me was meds :/,2
18353,wotzs6,Eskimofox5,"Wow this is almost my experience to the tea except that i didnt come out or anything. She was so upset over the fact that I had gone to a neighboring city with a college friend for a day vacation. I was wondering why that was a big deal because Im in college now and she doesnt check in with me almost ever to see where i am going.. How does she know im not going to farther places all the time?? Im not. Im just studying. 

This still doesnt make that much sense to me. I am the middle daughter of 3 girls in my family and ive always had such a long leash of freedom that i thought that that was the rule. Now she is switching the rules on me and its so confusing. 

We had a big fight about that and other things that we never resolve and then she told me to leave. I was so shocked that i drove to my local library and sat in the parking lot. (She told me a lot of other things too like how id never find another family that would love me as much as they did, etc.) 

Sometimes as an anxious person i would think of scenarios right before i go to sleep or just when i was bored about fights i might have or situations i might find myself in and i would plan it all out. But i had never planned for this one.",2
18354,wotzs6,closingbelle,"I know the feeling! At least you got the explanation and now you still have time left to make a difference in how you treat yourself. Love yourself instead of fucking yourself, right? Other people will do enough of that. Wanna hug it out?",4
18355,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Hey Duck, that is always a heck of a hurdle. Some moms just don't have that in them. They can't praise and love you for you because they're miserable with themselves. They just need you to do everything they didn't do, mostly because they had you and then blamed you for it. Moms like that are parents of ego, and that is never a recipe for a well adjusted adult child. Have you looked into therapy to work on letting go of your need for her approval? You don't have to, just asking. You can also just decide at any time that she doesn't matter any longer. That's a real thing you can actually do. Just decide that you don't care what she thinks anymore. Once that happens, it goes (usually one of two ways) to make her finally respect you as an adult and let you do your thing, or she locks up and then you can read about NarcMoms which might be helpful.

Either way, full marks from this mom for not falling into the trap this time! Good for you! 💙🤗",8
18356,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's a classic trauma response, and I'm guessing you're a classy person. You deserve to be appreciated and know that you are enough, just as you are. If you need external validation it's not always automatically bad either! You just have to get it in healthy ways, like from moms for a minute on Reddit. This is healthier at least because it's freely given and you can just bask without having to perform. Feel free to ask around here, people can't wait to tell you you're awesome. Probably cause you are! 💙",8
18357,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Hey Duckling, is there anyone IRL that you can call or text? If not that's okay too! We're here and you are definitely not alone. Have a virtual hug if needed and feel free to make a post so you can get more hugs okay? 💙",6

18364,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Glad you're happy to be checked in on! If you haven't found a great solution yet, I highly recommend looking up foam, like upholstery foam on Amazon. You can buy big blocks for cheap and customize a sitting up set up! I've helped people build these for different conditions like EDS and it might be useful for you too. Have a gentle hug if you want one Ducks. Feel free to check in with us too if you need any advice or support going forward! 🤗💙",4
18365,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's definitely rough. Let's try to manage the emotional rollercoaster just until you get more data, right? That's the right time to have some negative stuff. But, you can also feel better by researching your options now. What's your worst case scenario look like? How can you effectively handle the worst if it happens? That will really help your anxiety and depression, to have a plan or at least start looking for one. It sucks, and it's not fair. How can you make sure you get what you need anyway, in spite of them if necessary?",7
18366,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Empathy is one of the only things that truly connects humans. Unfortunately, you (hopefully) won't ever know their pain, and vice versa. You can try to talk about it, but until they are in a place where they can finally understand, it's pretty useless. And once they do get to that place (""Oh, if they do!"" Combined with ""Oh... if they *do*?"") then they'll be the ones reaching out to you anyway. So don't stress about it either way Ducks, you can't control it so you can't worry about it. Their empathy journey is theirs alone, fortunately and unfortunately. Would a hug help?",2
18367,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's always the toughest thing to say right? When you have to realize what actually happened to you? Well, I'm super proud of you for coming to realize it and working so hard on it that you were able to comment here today. So, thank you for existing. I really appreciate you. I love you and you are awesome. If you're interested, please have a digital-mom hug. You've won so far. Keep winning. 🤗💙",2
18368,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's awesome, glad to hear you're feeling better! Even just a little is better than nothing. 💙

18372,wotzs6,closingbelle,That's fantastic news Ducky! 💙🤓,1
18373,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's definitely the worst thing about being a responsible pet parent, it's so hard to know when something is wrong. You loved him. That was all you could do. You tried your best. That's also all you can do. You can and will miss them but that's normal too. Really happy that you have a solid support system! That's great, and please give your other furbabies a good big hug from us too! 💙",3
18374,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That really was incredibly unfair. School is just a training sim for working in a factory and it's incredibly outdated. You never should have been forced to do anything and I'm sorry you were. Please feel free to sit very still and rage about it if it helps. But that's usually just the pain talking, so really, I empathize with you and your pain. You're definitely being heard now, hopefully you feel a little more seen today because of it. 💙",4

18378,wotzs6,closingbelle,"You may not! Or at least not all of it, but that can be okay too! At a certain point in love or in life, you'll realize that's there's a lot of potential truth in ""ignorance is bliss"" and you'll start to appreciate the beauty of not knowing, the freedom of not having to know everything all the time. It's not a guarantee, but it's pretty common. I hope that helps you a little, this may not feel so weird later, that's all. Still really proud of you for respectful boundaries and letting your NC stand! 🤗💙",2

18380,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Well, you know how to rely on yourself, which is incredibly valuable too. But yep never hurts to ask for help. The worst they can say is no. The real trick is in learning how to ask for what you need until you get it, meaning you really can save a ton of time by determining how to ask, who to ask, etc. Maximize your chances of success right?",2
18381,wotzs6,closingbelle,"But YOLO is for quitters, so, coming back then, hopefully!",3
18382,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Hey, that's not totally on you. If you had proper support from your community, you wouldn't have to struggle as hard, right? Have you checked out r/assistance?",2
18383,wotzs6,closingbelle,"If she's as emotionally intelligent as she sounds, just ask if you're a burden. Seriously, you're only having that anxiety because you don't know, so ask. If she's a mom for a minute IRL, she'll be happy to reassure you, help you by setting healthy boundaries so that you can see what that looks like and then help you grow your own. Just ask if your communication is too frequent. The answer might surprise you but we're here either way for support after. 💙",2
18384,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Hey, sometimes families are supportive, sometimes not. As long as you have support, what you tell them is your business. 💙",2
18385,wotzs6,closingbelle,"You can tell us! We're super proud of you and excited for your growth! Self-discipline is a rocky road at first, but eventually it's all smooth strawberry. Cause you love yourself and get all gooey and pink on the inside. With love. ♥️",2
18386,wotzs6,closingbelle,Then I'm very sorry you have to be so strong. But I'm proud of you for doing it. You can be proud of yourself too. 💙,1
18387,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Fear is healthy! It makes you careful. ABSOLUTELY we can do that, have a giant hug and everything will be okay as long as you are Duckling. I promise. And if you're not okay, you find me and we patch you back up together. Cause I'm on your team kiddo and I'm rooting for you. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ 💙",1
18388,wotzs6,closingbelle,Absolutely agreed.,1

18392,wotzs6,closingbelle,Any time! 💙🤗,1
18393,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That realization is so difficult, right? But look at you! You did that part already! You are over the hump of realization and now you can cruise the highway of happiness and hope for your future self. Keep your boundaries strong, defend them really with your life. They are what will save you, because now you're going to save yourself. You already are, it's inevitable now. 💙",2
18394,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Yeah, I get that. Do you have anyone in your life that you feel you are good enough for? If not, please know, no matter what, you're more than good enough for me. I love you and I'm so proud of you, just for existing. 🤗💙",1
18395,wotzs6,closingbelle,It sucks the whole asshole Ducky. Totes agree. Wanna take some time and talk about it more? Or perhaps I can offset some of the suck with a hug? Big fluffy virtual hug? 💙,1
18396,wotzs6,closingbelle,Hey! Hi! I'm absolutely that Rent A Mom. Let's do this! What do you need Ducky?! Ask me how to do anything! 💙,1
18397,wotzs6,closingbelle,That takeaway is the best though. You got through it. You did that. You could probably do anything! 💙,2
18398,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's so smart! Intelligent thinking, guided by experience from last time. Literally a recipe for success. Just hang in a little longer. Would you like a distraction hug?",2
18399,wotzs6,closingbelle,Glad you're doing alright! It seems like you have a good handle on things and we're really proud of you for that! 💙,2

18404,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Ugh in a perfect world right? But at least in this one, you got to let it out a little onto the void! And look, the void loves you and is proud of you and really wants to hug you. Would you like a void hug? It's warmer and comfier than you think!",2
18405,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Oh sweet Scorp baby, you're probably the best kid ever. Thank you for trusting me enough to post this comment, truly. For a Scorpio, there's no higher horror than trust, believe me. Sending a massive hug because fuck yeah you did so well Ducky! 🤗🖤",2
18406,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Hey Ducks, have you reached out IRL for help yet? Do you need help finding help? Please let me know. Sending hugs and sympathy, because yeah this sucks. You are not alone though! We're here for emotional support and hugs, which isn't much, but maybe it's enough? Just for today? 💙",2
18407,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's fair. Good luck with the recording, have a hug! 🤗💙",2
18408,wotzs6,closingbelle,I'm sorry they weren't capable of being what you need. I hope now you're finding people who can be? Have a hug if it helps? 🤗,2
18409,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Hey it's okay! If you were hiding that only means the people around you didn't do enough to earn or keep your trust safe. That's good to be aware of that's a plus. Now you know what unsafe looks like, and you found us, safety! So that's fine if you're having to protect yourself right now. But look for the people IRL that feel safe. Reach out to them or find support here when needed. You're not alone now unless you want to be duck, we're here. 💙",2
18410,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's okay. You can hold it until it hurts you more to hang on to than to let go. You'll know when that moment comes, just try to trust your feelings now if you still need them then that's because you do. Nothing wrong with that. Are you talking to someone about the abuse?",1
18411,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's the way, focus on the positive, plan for the rest of the negative. You got this. You'll get it all taken care of. Slow and steady and check r/assistance!",3
18412,wotzs6,closingbelle,That's epic and I'm actually super proud and excited. Got screenshots?! Nerd with me! 🤓💙,2
18413,wotzs6,closingbelle,"You're not alone in any of that and it can feel so isolating, so I just want to remind you. Have an extra big hug:

#ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ

Bam! Bearhug.",2
18414,wotzs6,closingbelle,Congrats! 💙,1
18415,wotzs6,closingbelle,That's a completely reasonable boundary ducks. I'm proud of you for protecting yourself even if she didn't! 💙🤗,1
18416,wotzs6,closingbelle,"No problem Ducky leave it all there. Have a huge hug in exchange. 💙

#(っ.❛ ᴗ ❛.)っ",2
18417,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's truly a horrible thing to say to a kid I agree. You deserved better, but you've gotten this far because of your strength. It sucks you had to be that strong, but I'm really grateful you made it here to comment. 💙",1
18418,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's definitely understandable. We can't bring stuff back, but we can give you a hug and tell you that you're loved. Losing things is always tough and nothing will really make it better but time.",4
18419,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Hey that's fine too! You are under no obligation to. It's possible that you just noticed their discomfort or negative response, but I'm a subconscious kind of way. Like you may have seen something that they tried to hide or cover that made you even more uncomfortable, because then you couldn't trust their reactions in a bunch of different ways. Totally okay to not know though! Especially if it hasn't hurt you. 🤗💙",2
18420,wotzs6,closingbelle,Hmmm let's see. Do you work better with internal or external motivation?,1
18421,wotzs6,closingbelle,Yay! We love it when our Ducklings are loved the way they deserve! We're pretty proud of you for picking a good one. 😁💙,2
18422,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Nothing wrong with whatever you want Ducks, just have to decide what it is and then you can get to the ""living your best life""  part. Making decisions is always tough and that's normal. There's always a cost, or it wouldn't be a choice. You just have to decide what you can live with. Take your time, it's possible that the reason you're still in conflict is because you tried to rush it. See if slowing down and accepting the journey as it's own reward might make you feel a little better about the length of it? After all, it's just another way you're discovering yourself and that's always a good thing. 💙",2
18423,wotzs6,closingbelle,That sucks. Would you like hug? Or would you like to get some resources for the breakdown?,2
18424,wotzs6,closingbelle,We're really proud of you for picking up your pieces and putting them back together. 💙,1
18425,wotzs6,closingbelle,Congrats on your journey Duckling. 💙,2

18427,wotzs6,closingbelle,No worries. Have a virtual hug and a good day hopefully! 💙🤗,1
18428,wotzs6,closingbelle,Naps are actually super useful for processing power. Take a hug with you and a stuffed animal if need be. We're here if you need to talk after. No rush. 💙,2

18432,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Have you gotten checked for depression? That's something that could explain why it's so hard to feel the joy you intellectually know you should. Not saying you have to, just might make you feel better to get some answers. 💙",1
18433,wotzs6,closingbelle,Are you getting proper help for your anxiety Ducks? 💙,2
18434,wotzs6,closingbelle,"I would think that's pretty normal, it's a big chunk of a budget. Are you able to afford your options?",1
18435,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That sounds so tiring. Have you been doing anything for your self-care, making sure you prioritize yourself some days?",2
18436,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Hey, that's not that unusual. It's really easy to get discouraged even we are making progress and moving forward, because we let our brain skip ahead and imagine the good stuff. Keeping the focus on the present and the huge strides you've already made, even just reminding yourself how hard you're working on the now, that might help you stay grounded? If that doesn't, there are million other things that might work and I'll be here to suggest them all until we find one that helps. 💙",1
18437,wotzs6,closingbelle,"I'm very sorry you're going through this Duckling. Please have a virtual hug if it helps. Those people may not appreciate you, but we do. 💙",2

And it's going to be okay as long as you are. And you're here still so that's pretty much the right direction. 💙",2
18439,wotzs6,closingbelle,"I personally promise that unless you have an allergy, they will not kill you. They might (literally an infinitesimal chance) have some adverse effects, but those are all often less scary than the anxiety they are treating because even if you have an allergy, you probably still won't panic about it. It will be the calmest crisis of your life. Get the meds take the meds come here and chat with me for the entire duration of the medicine at first if needed, so you'll have someone who can talk you though any weird stuff you feel. Whatever it takes.

This is like walking around with a broken leg and you're worried the cast might have an impact on your walking. It's literally going to have an impact yes, but I promise, if it works the way it should and usually does, you're going to realize pretty quick how great it feels to take the pressure off your injuries.",2
18440,wotzs6,closingbelle,"I'm sorry for your lost time. And your losing the relationship you had even if might be better this way, that doesn't mean it didn't hurt. Sometimes we mourn our abusers even if we shouldn't and that's nothing to be negative about. It's just what we need to break free and heal. You're still going, but you've got this.",1
18441,wotzs6,closingbelle,"You're not! You are a human who hit a hurdle - that's normal. It's your business so the good thing is that tomorrow you can just channel all your frustrations into working hard enough to prove that they missed out on getting to know and experience their awesome kid.

18442,wotzs6,closingbelle,Just like that Ducks. Just get it all out in a safe place. You did great. 💙🤗,2
18443,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Ah I see! The dreaded cousinsized interlopers. Please know you're not alone in that cousin syndrome thing, it's often worse between hypercompetitive siblings. Have a big hug? ╰(⸝⸝⸝´꒳`⸝⸝⸝)╯",2
18444,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's normal when you're in pain. It's hard to get excited. That's okay. This should feel a little bittersweet or uncomfortable, because you are having to prepare to deal with a loss. Have a virtual hug if it feels right. (o´･_･)っ",1

18446,wotzs6,closingbelle,"It's never too late to get comfy. Anything that might help you feel like you've made some progress? If you think the window is closed already, it's usually just because you decided it was. Can you double check?",1
18447,wotzs6,closingbelle,That's hard work and work you can be proud of. I am absolutely proud of you!,2
18448,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Hey, that's great that you reached out! We're really happy to have you even for a minute. Just in case this is my only chance, from a mom, I love you and you're awesome and I am so proud of you already just for existing. Please have a hug if you want 🤗 and come back here any time for an extra one okay? 💙",1
18449,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Unfortunately Ducky it's all outside your control. Ask yourself if you are committed to being better. If you are then you will be eventually. If you always think you're the bad guy, then it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks right? Are you seeing anyone about the BPD? How's your support looking with those hurdles?",1
18450,wotzs6,closingbelle,We're excited for you too! Good luck and please feel free to let us know how it goes! 💙,1
18451,wotzs6,closingbelle,Fair. Happy birthday if it feels right and have a hug either way? 🤗,2
18452,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's really so hard, right? Having to hold so much of that inside? Even as a little kid... Well I'm very proud of you for getting this far, even if you had to go it alone before. Now you can build a new family, any (respectful) way you wanna do it, because look at how strong you already had to be. I'm really proud of you for making it here, even if it was hard. You did it. Sending a hug if you're interested? 🤗",2
18453,wotzs6,closingbelle,That's so great. Thank you for taking steps to get yourself help! That means so much to me. 💙,1

18455,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's really sad and then very awesome in one comment. I am so sorry and yet so grateful you weren't alone. Please have a hug if you want and know that mourning is whatever you say it is. So, you do you. That's the whole point. 💙",2
18456,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Helping others is over and above my top tip to feel better about anything, so kudos. You're doing great and don't give up it's tough but you've won so far. Look at you, still alive and kicking! I'm thankful and I love you and please have a hug if it's not too creepy. 🤗",3

18459,wotzs6,closingbelle,"So true! Great advice, I'm just so sorry it cost you so much to be able to have the wisdom to give it. Sending massive hugs because been there, done that and a hug might help. You're not alone. 💙(･–･) \\(･_･)/",2

18481,wotzs6,anorexicturkey,"So I talked to a financial advisor, an academic advisor, and a counselor at school and everyone said the same thing. Theres no way to reinstate my financial aid. There are no scholarships or grants available at this time. No emergency funds im not already receiving. 

Since I have enough credit hours I could get my AA, which would reset the max time limit im at for federal aid so I can use the last of my federal aid to complete my AS (that im 2 semesters away from finishing). But im missing 3 requirements so thats not a short term solution. Id still have to drop out of my program to finish the last 3 classes to get the AA, and with no financial aid that's 2k out of pocket to pay for it. Which is what this semester of my AS costs anyway.

I could pay my 2k tuition in installments, but its 430 a month. I realistically cant work a real job with classes 9am-8pm Monday and clinical hours from 7am-6pm Tues-Fri. I have Saturday and Sunday available, but no child care (and I babysit so my roommate can work Saturdays anyway). I cant get any private loans without a cosigner. No one in my life can co sign.

So..worst case scenario I drop out of school 2 semesters before my degree after I've been in school for 4 grueling years. 30k in student loan debt with no realistic way to pay. Im already living in someone else's front room, so at least im not technically homeless. But all the bills there are overdue so I very well might be. Which means moving 2k miles away to live with my mother, on the couch. Giving up my very loving boyfriend where I live. Staying in poverty which I've tried so hard to break free from.

I dont know what else to do to pay for school",1

Sometimes she tells me that she will call me and then forgets, because she is too busy with her own family. I know that she can support me emotionally, but I don't want to take out of her time too much. I wish I had a spreadsheet of ""reasonable time frame of talking to your aunt"". She is my mom's sister and she reminds me of her a lot, even with the fact that I can't recall any memories of my mom at all. I want to form a relationship, but I'm scared that I might be subconsciously rely on her too much.  I don't want to frustrate people:(

18519,wotzs6,joe_sausage,"Aw, thanks.  I should've added a /s as well, that was flippant of me.  I have a great therapist and a very patient wife and I'm slowly learning (at 37) to better articulate my needs and express my emotions in a healthy, kind, and functional way. 

But to perhaps add something more constructive to the thread:  this described me to a T as a youth.  I was a ""good kid,"" I never got in trouble, I never caused any grief, I kept to myself, I entertained myself, etc.   But I also came from an incredibly chaotic and unstable environment, and no adults around me were interested in my needs, no one healthily expressed emotions, etc. 

So looking back now it's pretty easy to see, ""oh, you very quickly intuited that the people around you weren't interested in your needs or giving you what you needed, and you became very good at avoiding any kind of provocation that you didn't want because of the explosive/violent results if you didn't, and you learned to take care of yourself because if you didn't, no one took care of you, and that's the kind of adult you are.""

This has profound effects on you as an adult, in your relationships, even just your day to day functioning by yourself.

So yeah.  I guess at this point I'd be a dad in this sub's context (no kids, just a dog), and so this is partially me saying, ""As that kid who's now an adult, YUP."" 

Thanks for the outreach. 💚",1

18527,wotzs6,Binx_da_gay_cat,"Barely, cause they want 2.5x rent in income. Which is fine, but I *just* started a second job and don't have paychecks from that yet. I really want to live alone but it's not looking feasible. I make $15/hr at my primary job and $11/hr at an overnight job. I don't know what else to do at this point. I left home earlier this year because my mom is a narcissist and I'm tired of relying on others.

I'm ready to be on my own, but I don't know what else to do.",1
18528,wotzs6,OutlanderMom,"It’s been a tough year because my 83 yo mother moved next door. It’s awoken a lot of long buried pain, so I’ve started seeing a therapist. The worst part is sitting there listening to her memories of my perfect childhood and her always-perfect behavior. And how she was unaware of any abuse from either of them. It’s hard to forgive and be the bigger person when I have to bathe her and listen to her basically discount the childhood my sister and I endured.",2
18529,wotzs6,catladyinma,Thanks Mom. I needed that A lot. 😢,1
18530,wotzs6,theYonderExile,"Thank you, your response means a lot. Insurance is being messy too, but once that’s squared I’ll pick them up for sure. 

No one has ever described the relief of the meds like you have, even my therapist. It sounds like heaven to just be calmer and not have panic attacks all the time 🥹",2
18531,wotzs6,Danivelle,Thank you!  I have two double cousins (father's are twins and so are moms) that are the good cousins. We are very close and I'm hoping to see them next month and go horse riding!,1

18535,wotzs6,s0larium_live,i’m in therapy but it’s been like a month since i went cuz i was out of town. i’m on mood stabilizers. i’ve worked on better coping mechanisms like journaling and just generally being a bigger person and walking away when something upsets me or talking rationally with whoever upset me instead of lashing out. i’m trying *so hard* to be better and i’m scared that it’s not doing anything and that i’m still a bad person. i don’t want to be that person anymore. i hurt other people and i wasn’t happy. but what’s the point of trying to be better if everyone is still going to hate me for my past mistakes anyway..?,1
18536,wotzs6,Ambrosia1989,"Hey mom :) I thought about following up here instead of creating a post

&#x200B;

My appointment went very well and my therapist even noticed that I looked more rested than the last time we talked. We're both glad of my progress and even concluded that today's session could be the last! My file with my therapist is still open for 60 days if there's anything, so I know the possibility of a quick appointment is still there. But I do feel like I'm on the right path to help my mental health better. The motto for the next few months ""One Step At A Time"". 

&#x200B;

I'll take good care of myself and I also have the support of my amazing boyfriend (+3 years relationship and +6 years friendship). Take care of you too!",1
18537,wotzs6,FlatEngineering764,thank you so much <3 sad that 18 wasn’t what i thought it would be but so damn proud of myself. excited to start fresh,1

18541,wotzs6,Book_Nerd_Engineer,"I like what I’m learning at school but in my internship I question if this is really for me. I’ve always been a more artsy creative person but my mom always told me to go into STEM cause I’m good at math, it makes more money, and I am capable of getting the work done. Sometimes I wonder if I really like what I do and what I’m doing with my life but I never know the answer. I’m a go with the flow easygoing girl and I feel like I’m in too deep to quit. I want to find time and motivation to write stories but I never do. 

There’s all these things about myself that make me question if I’m just one big ball of defense mechanisms floating through life and trying to find a solid foot to stand on. 

Thanks for the virtual hug :)",2

Thank you, needed it much lately",1
18545,wotzs6,closingbelle,Aww any time! 💙,5
18546,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Ah, then I can empathize there and it really is the whole enchilada of awful. Would a virtual hug help in any way? If not, totally cool, not everyone feels better after knowing a stranger loves them and wants to give them a good big digitally-enhanced hug. But I mean, would it hurt to try? Lame, yes. But potentially effective.",13
18547,wotzs6,ScrembledEggs,"I recommend taking the initiative on that and either nagging your dad or making the calls yourself then telling him you’ve found a place (I assume he’ll be paying, so you’ll need to tell him). Professional help changes everything. Even if the therapy itself doesn’t work for you, having a neutral party who’ll listen without judgement and offer insight when it’s wanted and needed can be so beneficial. Plus they can help you get medical diagnoses and medication, if those are things you’re interested in.

Source: Didn’t think I’d make it to 18, therapy is helping me turn 22 later this year",2
18548,wotzs6,closingbelle,Any time.,3
18549,wotzs6,ScrembledEggs,"If she doesn’t want a daughter, then she doesn’t get one. Cutting contact can be very difficult and painful, but consider reducing contact. You set the boundaries, you speak with her on your terms, and you establish consequences if she oversteps your boundaries.

For example, “If you misgender me, I will correct you. If you argue with me about it, I’ll walk away and message you when I’m ready and want to. Until then, your number will be silenced in my phone and you’re not welcome to reach out to me until I initiate.”",2

18552,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Are you sure that's the only solution? You know what you'll sacrifice by going home, but what are you willing or able to sacrifice to stay? Have you checked out obscure college scholarships, have you called local charities? Is there any way to take a semester off, work there, save up and return? Any other bills are probably not as big of a priority and you can always clean up your credit after you graduate and get that great job.",2

18559,wotzs6,closingbelle,"You're very welcome, any time.",2
18560,wotzs6,closingbelle,😁 we're very flexible on this timeline.,2
18561,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Definitely. And I recommend starting with MHUK they should have the best list of resources and that should then help you determine if you need a solicitor, but yeah, I just know how much of a struggle this probably is and I want to make sure you're getting at least the support that's available. Good luck and feel free to come here for support too, any time.",1
18562,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Ah, okay that's totally normal too, it's a trauma response in some cases, but that's not the road you're on now, if that makes sense. You have gotten into the better path of at least trying. That's huge. And ironically, wanting to protect others even from yourself is highly compassionate of you. So, not bad at all! But important to really feel safe with it, so you can actually tackle this problem yourself, by actually making a spreadsheet.

I know, you were being silly but I'm serious! Every time you talk to her, record data about her response, of her reaction and how much time you took, if she looked or sounded bored, etc. The best evidence is evidence that will convince you, and that's usually evidence you gather yourself. Once you have a few weeks, look at the data. Is there's any time you got a bad response? Any particular time she's always impatient (like maybe her favorite show is on Tuesday night or something and you notice she has less time then?), etc. This can let you relax a little once you've got enough data that you can see you aren't imposing.

Obviously don't get obsessed about the data gathering lol just saying. If you need reassurance, this is one way you might be able to get it for yourself, which is super useful.",2
18563,wotzs6,closingbelle,Any time. 🤓,1
18564,wotzs6,closingbelle,Any time Duck. 💙,1
18565,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Aww we're so super excited that you're here! You'll get through this, that's absolutely true. Just make sure to grab any support you need along the way here. No reason it has to be a lonely boring journey! 💙",1

18586,wotzs6,closingbelle,♥️🤗⊂(◉‿◉)⊂,2
18587,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Meh if you're still in treatment then that's okay to not be feeling the joy yet. It's pretty common for that kind of thing to take some time. Joy is weird, happy is weird, it's kind of like... like a limb that's been asleep for a while, sorta kinda. You gotta stretch out the sleepy-numb feeling, get through the mental pins-and-needles, and then you get to use it again. I believe in you.",1
18588,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Oh okay, first put that shame down and walk away. It's toxic and it's not yours and no. Someone else gave you that and you do not have to carry it another second. That's your choice now that you know it's not yours, you don't have any use for it, right?

But after that, would you like help finding stuff and info? Would you like me to just link you a MH sub here where you can ask questions? Just tell me what you need Ducks.",2
18589,wotzs6,closingbelle,Yeah it's unfortunate but that's really the only way. Work stupidly hard and do it all on your own. Or roommates? If they have good boundaries it can be like living alone.,1
18590,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Hmmm I work with caregivers all the time and caregiver burnout is real and dangerous. But this sounds more like unresolved resentment so yeah, that's a great call on the therapist either way. You have every right to your emotions Duck, just remember to let go of anything that hurts you more than it hurts them. You don't need to carry anyone's baggage but your own and you can put that down any time your ready. I'm really proud of you for doing all this hard work under such difficult circumstances. She might not accept the blame for what she did, but she also doesn't get any of the credit she didn't deserve for how awesome you are now. This is all you. You're the biggest person anyway because you're motivated by love and kindness, even in the face of this situation. You're doing great. Honestly and truly.",2
18591,wotzs6,closingbelle,Glad to be here for you! 🤗,1
18592,wotzs6,closingbelle,"I speak from experience, allergy attack included. I was so completely chill the whole 911 call, the whole ambulance ride, everyone was terrified and I later thought it was hilarious. But yep, a quick shot in the butt and I went home to enjoy the rest of my completely relaxing day. Truly, still, one of the most relaxing days of my life. And the rest of the meds weren't nearly as effective (probably something about the lack of oxygen boosting the effects LOL) BUT they still worked so well that I only took them for about a year. That's all the time I needed to be able to get a system embedded in my brain to balance things without chemicals to help me. Just like taking a cast off, not everyone has to be on every med forever. Only the ones you need to be on forever, right? And you'll work with your doctor hopefully to fight for that if you want.

But yeah, my only concern is if it's a benzo, then just make sure to take the minimum you need only when you need so you don't pick up an addiction, cause like who needs that extra hurdle at this point right? 🤓",2
18593,wotzs6,closingbelle,That's sweet and awesome and have a great time! 💙,1
18594,wotzs6,closingbelle,Any time.,1
18595,wotzs6,closingbelle,We're here if you need support.,1
18596,wotzs6,closingbelle,Oh of course. 💙,2
18597,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's only because you're focused on the wrong opinion. The only one that matters is what you think of yourself. Because you're the only one who really had to live with yourself 24/7, right? So you have to love yourself and really every other person doesn't mean anything real until you do.

If you're trying to be better for other people or their approval, it will never work right and you'll be miserable. Don't hurt yourself like that. Find a reason to change that is just for you.",1

18600,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Okay that's usually the anxiety about being alone making it feel awful. So, first, you're never truly alone, we're here. Now, is there any reason you can't reach out to your ex? And are you okay with moving out? We're here if you want to talk, feel free to make a post, too, for lots of support. 💙",1
18601,wotzs6,closingbelle,"That's so big, that kind of fear, I know. That's why it's so hard to fight, to struggle, sometimes it's like a riptoe, you have to give into the momentum and pretty much surrender. At least then you get a chance to breathe and relax your muscles while you find a new path to safety. Panic is your only enemy when it comes to fear. If you can stay calm but afraid, then you can still get yourself safe. Have a bunch of hugs and feel free to come here if you need help finding motivation to keep swimming, even if you decide to relax and struggle a little less. 💙",2
18602,wotzs6,closingbelle,"Any time. Just remember the only reason you don't do what you want is usually because of someone else. Just make sure it's a good reason, like your children, not something someone else put on you, right? 💙",3

18606,wotzs6,anorexicturkey,"I've already stopped paying on my credit cards,  which sucks but it is what it is. My phone service has already been disconnected. My only personal bills are my car insurance and gas. I drive over an hour one way to go to my clinical sites, so unfortunately those bills can't be lowered. 

If I take a semester off, that's still being dropped from my program as it's a health science/ clinical rotation. They are classes that are only taught once a year and to be accepted into the program is hard, there's only 13 in it currently. I spoke with my teacher and if I took the semester off, I would have to reapply to the program and if I wanted to remain at my current progress level, I'd have to retake all of my exams from the previous semesters and all of my clinical competencies to prove I still have my same knowledge base. On top of that, i would be set back a whole graduation year. Which I wouldn't care about too much, except that means 6 months down the road Uncle Sam comes knocking looking for me to start paying the loans ive already taken out. 

I'm looking for jobs now, and I set up a tuition installment plan. And at this point I'm just taking it day by day. I have until the 22nd to pay for my first 400 installment payment. Im honestly willing to sacrifice everything possible, I just dont know what's left. Ive already sold everything of value I own to try and pay this first installment.

Check r/studentloansupport (spoiler: I'm a mod there too! lol). It's a mental health focused support sub for exactly this kind of stuff.

18651,wotzs6,closingbelle,As a SW you must have your own therapist and EAP? Do they have any daycare or child care support?,1
18652,wotzs6,closingbelle,Of course. And if it's not enough just let me know. 💙,1
18653,wotzs6,closingbelle,"I certainly would accommodate a roommate like that, so yeah, trying to find someone who is easy going might work. Just remember to offer the same courtesy back where you can. You'll do great either way.",1
18654,wotzs6,Dangerous_Payment509,"Oh sadly no. 
Daycare will be from September.",1
18655,wotzs6,Binx_da_gay_cat,"I'd easily offer the same back. I'm kinda the ghost roommate. You won't know I'm there. It's how I feel safest - or it's a trauma response, idk.",2

I'm at the park rn tho, I'll drink the water, but the A/C filter has to wait til I get home... if i remember it😆",149

18774,vsz7fw,baabaaredsheep,"Instructions unclear. Drank the water pooling in my AC.

Just kidding, this is good advice. I checked my kid’s portable (floor) AC in their room yesterday and turns out the darn thing had water that hadn’t been properly drained and had started leaking all over the floor. So check your AC reservoir too, if you have one.",51
18775,vsz7fw,KrankySilverFox,Thanks MamaBear ❤️ good advice. I just changed my AC and water filters and got a big glass of fresh water.,100

18783,vsz7fw,Lkpincognito,Thank you. Ordered new filters. They’ll be here on Sunday,7
18784,vsz7fw,Regret_the_Van,"I washed mine before firing the ACs up this year.  Hot soapy water and a sponge make quick work of the dust.

Buy spray on coil cleaner if the AC is musty, follow the directions and YouTube if you get stuck.  And keep the unit tipped back slightly.  I've seen so many problems started by people tipping the AC forward making the water drain inside.",7

Also ion know about the water part",2

I'm not going to do any of those things, because it's winter here (which you'd literally know if you paid ANY attention to me AT ALL), but I'll set an alarm to check my filters tomorrow, and buy batteries for the remote for my heater, is that OK with you? Is that enough? Are you happy now?

18853,vsz7fw,SkyrimWidow,Use the reminder bot😁,64
18854,vsz7fw,KahurangiNZ,"What else has filters in your house?  Bathroom extractor fan?  That's what I'm about to do (winter here, son't need to worry about the AC), now that I stop and realise the damn thing has been up there over a decade and I don't know that it's ever been done...",34
18855,vsz7fw,xparapluiex,If you have a fan clean the blades (while it is off),8
18856,vsz7fw,,"If you have an air conditioner, it would depend on what kind you have.

Window unit: it's usually on the inside side. There's usually a front panel to remove, then take out the filter and wash or replace depending on whether it's disposable or not.

Central a/c is a filter usually behind a large air return in the wall. (The place where air gets sucked in rather than blown out) This is usually in a hallway somewhere or in the ceiling. There are usually nuts that get loosened then the panel swings open or comes off. 

Be sure to use the old filter measurements (usually on the side of the old filter).

These have to be changed at least every 3 months for proper functioning of both your air conditioner and your lungs. 

If you forget to change them regularly, the first thing you'll notice is how dusty your place suddenly gets! If I'm not sure when the last time the filter was changed, say after I move into a new place, I'm probably going to give it only a month before changing out with a new one.

Pro tip: more expensive does not mean a better filter. For proper functioning of the air conditioning unit, usually the cheaper ones work best because they allow for better airflow. Use the allergy ones if you need to, but know that it will probably put a strain on your air conditioning system.

Edit: be sure to notice the arrows on the new filter! They'll tell you which way the filter goes (it only goes one way). The arrows point in the direction of airflow, so on an air return, the arrows should point toward the hole you're filling with the filter.

Edit 2: if you didn't know about air filters, and you're changing yours after years, prepare to FREEZE once your new filter is on! Things are going to be much cooler from now on! (Oh and set yourself a reminder for 3 months from now)

Edit 3: Don't try to be clever, Dear, and leave the filter off. Trust me, you need it. ;)",20
18857,vsz7fw,KahurangiNZ,"Do you have an AC unit?  If so, the bit on the wall inside will have filters in it that need cleaning occasionally or they get full of dust and gunk and the AC doesn't work as well as it should :-)",7

18881,vsz7fw,KahurangiNZ,"Ah yes, the car air filter.  Right!  Yes!  Who would forget those!  

Erm ... I'm just popping out to the garage for a ... thing.  Be right back :-)",5
18882,vsz7fw,Doctor_of_Recreation,"Well, if you take your car in for maintenance regularly they should do it for you. My repairman does it for the cost of the filter only (as long as I’m, you know, getting other work done).",4
18883,vsz7fw,,"No, that's what Mama Bear is referring to.

Although, if you own your home, you may want to check on whether there is a secondary filter inside the unit itself (the part in the attic). Some (all?) central air conditioners have an internal filter there. If you're having your unit regularly maintained by a professional, they may be changing that out then. It requires taking your a/c apart, so it's certainly not meant to be done as regularly as the filter you're talking about.

When someone charges the unit with freon, you could have them answer questions about that.",8
18884,vsz7fw,SkyrimWidow,Yes a 6000 BTU unit,2
18885,vsz7fw,Inafray19,"There are two filters. The air intake that's in the engine compartment. It's easy access and can be changed when they fill your oil. That's the one most people think of when you think of an air filter in your car. This filters the air that goes into your engine. 

The cabin air filter is in the dash, you have to take the glove box out to access it. Most people have no idea that the ac has its own filter. If you take it to a place that you can stay in the car while they service it and you don't see them in your passenger seat pulling the glove box out it wasn't replaced. If you see ""cabin air filter"" on your itemized receipt you're paying for a part you didn't get. If it's a place you drop it off or sit in the waiting room while it's serviced, and see that line item ask to check your car, pull the glove box out and check to see if it's new. It's fairly easy, open the glove department, look for little buttons or slides on the sides or back of the glove box, push those and it should just fall off. You'll see the back of the ac and you'll see where the filter goes.",5
18886,vsz7fw,CentiPetra,"If you have a secondary AC filter, which the AC people change...  

They have told me to no longer use a filter at the intake airflow vent area. So now it's basically just a giant hole. They said putting a second filter there is bad and restricts airflow too much or something. But I don't know, I really hate the idea that there is basically a huge hole uncovered behind the grating.  

Does this seem right to you? I'm just asking because you seem to know things. Anyone can chime in if they have insight though. Thanks.",1

19097,w7alib,WTFucker-0202,"Honey, you are so very welcome. Please know that you're not alone in feeling this way. I'm 50 and I have only just now begun to realize how little of a fuck it matters what other people think about me... how I look, my opinions, my lifestyle... 

*I'm* important to me. *I'm* beautiful to me. My happiness means more to me than if some rando thinks I'm pretty or thin or whatever. 

Again, I know it can be hard to be okay with who you are. Try to remember that no one is keeping score but you. If you are a winner in your book, then others will see you as a winner too. 


All that said, very honestly, you are truly a lovely looking young lady. Find something about yourself that you believe is gorgeous -- your eyes, your hair, your shoulders, whatever! -- and focus on rocking that. That will help boost your confidence, which will, in turn, make you feel prettier overall. 

Most importantly, be easy on yourself. The world can be so harsh, give yourself the permission to love every little imperfection. It makes you *you*, and *you* are beautiful.",26
19098,w7alib,TheGrimDweeber,"You should have been told this thousands of times, growing up. 
Do not sell yourself short. Do not settle for the first dickweed (sorry, this is absolutely how I would talk to my grown up kids, I’ve got a potty mouth) that comes along and pays you attention.

You are beautiful, make up or no make up. 
Do whatever the hell you want with your hair. I think you might have curls. Embrace them! Your eyes, overall features and your smile, as demure as it may be, they’re beautiful. 

I don’t know how went out of their way to knock you down, but those idiots were assholes. 
The only thing missing in this picture, is a fierce sense of confidence. What all of us mommas can see so clearly, you’ve got to embrace yourself. And that will take time, and effort. To undo something takes a lot of effort. But trust me. I don’t lie. I hate lying. And I am telling you: 

You are beautiful.",2

It can be hard to see our own beauty because society tells we aren’t allowed to own it (a confident woman is a dangerously powerful thing) and there’s pictures everywhere telling us all about what we lack because capitalism runs on wounded self esteem telling us we need the next thing to become whole or good enough. But trust me, you are quite beautiful. You have lovely soulful eyes, a perfect nose and gorgeous lips. And don’t get me started on your luminously glowing skin!

Secondly, I can't explain why, but it makes me so proud to hear you say you only have one person you care to look pretty for. As you get more comfortable with it, you'll be able to add one more person to that checklist. And then before much longer, she'll be the one that matters the most on that list. (...you...I'm talking about you. Did that come through okay? Geez..awkward mom moment.)
Finally, you shall never return that shirt to him. Unless he needs it on a long trip away from you to remind him of your scent. Yours now. It suits you too well. I so decree. The end.",2

19118,ww0n0o,HollowShel,"It's always hard to be the one left behind. If it's any comfort, I'm sure her last days were fantastic ones, and her only regret would be leaving you alone.

I third, fourth, fifth or anything else the calls that you should seek therapy. This is incredibly hard, and you shouldn't have to navigate it alone.

One thing to remember is that whatever you're feeling, *everything* you're feeling, it's ok to feel that way. Even if you're *angry* it's ok. You've suffered a terrible blow, and you're the one who has to go on, and the universe has not been kind to you this week past. Anger's one of the stages of grief, and it doesn't mean you don't love her (I'm not saying ""loved"" because you *still* love her. She's gone but that love remains.) All anger means is that you're suffering and wish you could find some way to make it hurt less. 

You'll go through a lot of grief stages, and probably circle back around to a few several times. It's ok to be devastated. Don't be devastated alone, though. It's tempting to shut out the world like this but I repeat, seek therapy, and keep seeking it if the first therapist isn't a good fit. (It can happen!)",646
19119,ww0n0o,mchy_i_paprocie,"Hi. Im so sorry for your loss.
I lost my fiancee 6 years ago. He was 29. He was my only person as I do not keep in touch with my family.
My friends struggled to help me. I tried counselling amd ended up in a hospital feeling totally alone. I would have never expected that his mom would become my dearest friend. We still speak daily, today about everything but back then about him. She was the only one to understand my loss. She is the only one I can still talk about him today as she understands he still is important. She reminds me of him and tolerates my shitty sense of humour cause its exactly like his. I needed a safe space and she needed someone who would remember him with her.
I didnt know her when he died. And I would have never expect her to become my family. Maybe it sounds odd but if you too do not have anyone, maybe one of your fiancee's loved ones would need you and you could have a space to cherish her. Its good to feel needed and valued by someone who loved her.",393
19120,ww0n0o,Me-Here-Now,"Dear One. My daughter died from an aneurysm 4 years ago She was 39 , and left her life partner behind. I don't know exactly what you are going through, but in a way I understand. We've both lost someone.

I'm not your mother, but I was someone's mother. It seems that you are short a mother. Maybe I can offer you some internet love and support. Your a strong person to take care of yourself all this time. You know what a gift it is to truly love and be loved. That memory can help carry you through.

PTSD associated with sudden loss is different for everyone. Please, do not solely focus on grief stages, be aware its normal for you to feel all other emotions du to shock and potentially trauma. Be kind to yourself. Its not a regular grief. It hits different and its normal.",31
19126,ww0n0o,wasakootenayperson,"Find your glbtq Centre and see if they have a therapist. There are usually grief counsellors at community mental health centres (Canada) best of luck wherever you are. 

I am so sorry for your loss - and so very happy that she was so loved and cherished before she had to leave you.",180
19127,ww0n0o,Bubblesnaily,"Gentle hugs, duckling. 

My cousin lost her love to an aneurysm very young, a month after their child was born. It was decades ago, but I've seen how her life trajectory changed. 

My heart aches for the pain you're going through. 

It can be so hard when you can see the life you want and then life takes a massive curve. 

When I (only child, separated from toxic parents) lost my ex-wife due to a separation I didn't see coming and didn't understand...

It was really hard to figure out who I was and what my life could look like without her in it. 

Give yourself time and space to process your grief over her passing and mourn the life you won't have. She had died, but your future with her is no longer there either, so you're grieving for yourself too.

You're grieving both things. And that's okay. 

When the time is right, cherish and remember the good memories you made together. 

The sharp pain of your double loss is going to be overwhelming for a long while, but it will fade to be less painful. 

Best advice I can give: 

1. No new relationships for at least a year, maybe even two. Figure out who you are and what you want without another person there to influence you. 

2. Keep yourself busy. Make a plan to sign up for a spring semester adult education class. Buy a guitar or ukulele and take lessons in person or via an app. Practice solving a Rubik's cube until you can solve the whole thing without looking at the steps to solving it. Learn a new language through Duolingo. Journal. Participate in NaNoWriMo in November and write a book.",27
19128,ww0n0o,chelle_rene,"Im so sorry for your loss. This hits so close to me. Back in 2009 my brother who was 28 died at work from a brain aneurysm. Like he was the kind of guy to run marathons and was healthy as can be. Just one day he dropped to the ground and he was gone. Ive been told there was no way he was able to feel pain because he was gone in a instant. Im not gonna lie and say its going to be easy dealing with this. My family never recovered from his loss because it was so sudden and tragic. I was 15 years old when it happened and it was my first real experience with death. My parents put me in therapy but the hole in my heart from his loss never closed. All my family has now are memories and photographs. My oldest sons middle name is named after his uncle that he was never able to meet. 

Cherish the memories and know that even though they are gone, they went knowing they were so loved.",23

If you are in the US, reach out to your local nonprofit hospice to seek free grief counseling. If you need help figuring out where to start, message me. I’m a hospice social worker. 

Do you have a primary care doctor? If so, call them. Tell them what happened and see if they might  prescribe something to help you sleep. Or, if you prefer non-medication interventions, put ease buds in and listen to guided meditations for sleep. There are literally thousands on YouTube. 

Hang in there, love. This is a hard, scary road, but you are NOT ALONE. You are loved and special and you will get through this.",11

Not a day goes by that I don't think about him. I hate saying I'm sorry or my condolences bc at first it sounds meaningless, but most people do mean it.

That family is messed up, so make a new one. I don’t know what the future is going to be like for you, but you’re allowed to keep Emma in your heart forever.

I lost my boyfriend suddenly in 2015…we broke up right before he died. My one piece of advice is to find a support group….. going to the group caused me to have my first ever epiphany and it is the only reason I was able to begin the healing process. 

Also, please, please practice a lot of self care. This is a lot to process, especially considering how long you were together and the recent engagement. If you have any questions about grieving, please reach out to me. I’ll keep you in my thoughts",3
19146,ww0n0o,Cavolatan,"Oh sweetheart.  Text a friend and ask them to help you find a therapist.  If you don’t have a friend you can contact, you can DM me your location and price range and I’ll look on your behalf.  A grief support group would be excellent too.

I wonder if you could sleep on the couch, or with your head where your feet usually go, so it feels a little different.  It’s normal to have trouble sleeping when something like this happens.  

If you can afford it, I’d get a bunch of easy to eat food.  Frozen burritos, yogurt, stuff like that, so you don’t have to cook.  Be sure to keep yourself hydrated, too.

It will fking horrify you how quickly folks get uncomfortable talking about a death. If you can bear it, do it now.

(Also, if you are either not comfortable with therapy or are a person who finds solace in reading, may I recommend a book? A writer I used to know lost his wife very young and very suddenly -- pulmonary embolism. His book about it is really insightful, not least about how weird and infuriating and surreal young widowhood can be. It's called Love Is A Mixtape [he is a music writer] and his name is Rob Sheffield.)

Even 2 years out, there are still things that catch me off guard and immediately bring tears to my eyes, despite me speaking easily about him most of the time. Prioritize taking care of yourself above everything else. It is ok to say no to people when you just don't have the energy. So many people struggle to keep up a facade when they really just need to be able to let it all go. If taking things one day at a time seems too long, try one hour. If that is to much, keep backing it down. Going minute by minute is still an accomplishment.",1

Grief is love with no place to go.

Some days it's like an anchor on your heart.
Cold and heavy.
Some days it's an emptiness so hollow nothing is able to fill it.

Grief like love never ceases, we just adjust. Learn to breath around the ragged edges.

Some days we find joy in the splinters of the pieces that remain of the Person we where when our love was here in this plain to be hugged and kissed.

There is no right or wrong. You do grieve all of you as well as all of her. This is a hard thing. You are very strong for already you have lived through one of the hardest things there is. Writing it out. Admitting to the World, that is what happened. That truly it did happen to you.

Take it slow, love. Let yourself be fed by others. Let yourself feel and go empty and feel again. 

Some day your love will be free again of the daggers it brings now. Richer and New in the depth you learned to span gracefully.

It very closely resembles my relationship with grief, and it'll be four years this November since I lost my grandfather \[a different grief, but grief all the same\]. 

Some days will be easy. Some days it will be hard - impossible, even. You'll feel *horrible* about your good days, about laughing again, about enjoying life because it's awful that she isn't with you. And that is perfectly okay - normal, even.

I'm SO, SO sorry that life decided that this had to happen. 
Firstly, my inbox is open if you need. Not just a mama, but a psych major, and grief mentor for the past 8 years. 

There are lots of compassionate responses to your post, and I'm sure you have been given all manner of advice. Grief is one of those things that hits people differently. And it changes day to day. 
Right now you should be focussing on getting something decent to eat and a good hydrating drink. 
Sleep is hard, and it will be for a while. The dark hours stretch long especially if you are alone. 

Our first loves are always memorable, and she has been a significant part of your life for a long time. It's ok to feel, or not feel. As long as you aren't using things to numb out the pain. 
You will have to work through this, otherwise it will break you apart. Sometime we have to remember how much they loved us, and that they would want us to be ok. And you gave her a beautiful gift- loving her for the rest of her life. And probably for the rest of yours too, even if in time that love becomes background like the way you love a favourite memory, experience or place. 

There are so many really great resources for grief and understanding it.

I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.”",1
19203,ww0n0o,Due-Cryptographer744,"I am scrolling Reddit trying to distract myself from today being the 11 year anniversary of my son's death and I saw your post. I think my son knew you needed a momma hug from me. It is hard to lose someone you love so much. It sucks and I'm not going to sugarcoat the suck. People here are telling you to go to therapy but I'm going to say only do so if you feel ready. Immediate therapy might be right for some people and it might be right for you but you also may need time. 

Grief is one of those things in our society that makes other people uncomfortable so they want you to hurry up and move on to ease THEIR discomfort. Don't do that. Be sad. Be angry. Feel all the feelings that you need to as long as you need to feel them. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, only your way so please do not allow anyone to pressure you into rushing anything. 

You may need to see your doctor to get something to help you sleep (I was put on Ativan and later Trazadone) and possibly an antidepressant. Intense grief can cause your body to stop producing serotonin, dopamine and/or norepinephrine, which can all cause depression symptoms. For some people it may just be temporary but other people may need medication more long term. Thankfully, I had a great primary care doctor that our whole family saw and she immediately called in sleep meds for me as soon as she heard what happened. (My son had a scheduled appointment in her office the day he passed.)

The main advice I can give you is absolutely, positively do not make any major decisions right now or for the next 3-6 months (at least!) if there is any possible way to avoid it. Don't give any of her things away now, don't move out of the place you shared (unless you cannot afford it alone) don't quit your job, etc. The emotions you are feeling right now will lead you to making rash decisions that you will likely regret later once you aren't so foggy headed. 

I had a difficult childhood and my parents both died when I was 18 (not that they were much support) so I understand not having much of a support system. If there is ANYTHING and I mean anything that you need to talk about, need advice on how to handle or whatever, please do not hesitate to reach out. It doesn't matter what time it is. (I am in the US in Texas, so Central time zone, CST.) 

Love, your internet Momma",1
19204,ww0n0o,virtualsmilingbikes,"I'm so sorry for your loss. Please don't make any decisions for now, just take care of yourself as best you can, eat a little even if you're not hungry and sleep whenever you are able. Grief is painful, because emotional pain affects the same part of the brain as physical pain, however feeling it is the only way to heal. To begin with the waves of grief will crash over you and make it feel like you can't breathe, but you can and you will, and in time the waves will become further apart. If you try to block it all you do is delay the inevitable, so it's important to find a way to process it safely. That might mean a face-to-face support group, or a doctor, or a therapist, or an online forum, so take your time to figure out what helps and what doesn't. Lots of the possibilities will be local and I don't know where you are, but you might find a starting point here [https://www.verywellmind.com/best-online-grief-support-groups-4842333](https://www.verywellmind.com/best-online-grief-support-groups-4842333)",1

19208,ww0n0o,HelloRedditAreYouOk,"Idk if it will help *at all*, for the pain you’re in rn, but the moment I read that you literally *just* proposed, and she said yes, my immediate thought was “ohhh wow, she (and you!!) left on *such* a beautiful high note!” It’s like leaving the party while you’re having the most fun… she got to go *knowing* how very much you love her, and knowing that *you*, too, know how very much she loves *you*. Small comfort I know, and it’s so totally ok if that same high note also makes the pain of her sudden absence even more intolerable, but I hope you know, and *can feel*!!!, her unconditional, profound love for you even now that her body isn’t here, because that love *doesn’t* die. It can’t, and it’s yours until the day you die, and I’m just so f*cking sorry, OP. It’s not fair and you both deserved a physical lifetime together, and I’m just hugging you so tight rn. I’m with you in heart, message any time if the loneliness (esp at night) gets to feeling like too much, ok?",1
19209,ww0n0o,oldapples1979,"Alexa there is a saying that is so overused, but overused precisely because of how true it. It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. You are so young. Too young to experience grief of this magnitude. But as you grow older you will continue to lose the people you love the most. And then you have to face the question the above saying answers. If there is a good chance we will lose the people we love, why love at all?? Why go through the hell of losing the people that matter most? Why not just be alone so as to protect our heart from the pain? To me, I would rather experience the gift that is true love, even if I don't get to keep that love for my entire life, than to go my entire life without experiencing love nor loss. I will take the loss to experience the love. I am so sorry, you are too young to have to lose your great love. You deserved so many more decades together. But I'm so happy for you that you at least have known what great love is, even if she was taken far too soon. I send you my love.",1
19210,ww0n0o,smallangrynerd,"Oh sweetheart, I am so so sorry. I can't even imagine the pain of losing a partner.

You're probably feeling a lot of terrible things: grief, anger, pain, fear, guilt... and I just want you to know two things:

1. You're allowed to feel all these things. You're allowed to cry, to scream. You're going through one of the worst moments of your life, so don't let anyone dare tell you that you're overreacting. These feelings are hard to work through on your own, so I highly recommend finding a therapist or grief counselor to help you.

2. You did everything right. You made her happy. You may feel some guilt, and that's normal, but know that there was nothing you could've done to prevent this. Aneurysms are scary and can happen to anyone, and while it's easy to want to blame someone, unfortunately it's just one of those tragedies that just happens with no reason. Again, I recommend finding a professional to help you work through these feelings.

I wish you luck, kid. Take your time to heal, everyone has their own process when it comes to greif. And please take care of yourself. Drink water, eat some bread, just the basics. I don't want you getting sick.

My favorite analogy is the ball bouncing inside of a box, and on one wall of the box their is a button that is pain and grief and sorrow. When the ball hits the button we experience a wave of these emotions. It’s strong and intense and it’s hard, but over time, that button starts to shrink, it’s still always there, we still get hit with waves of pain, but it’s less and less often, and also over time we learn ways to cope with the pain in better and more effective ways. I just encourage you to keep pushing on. allow yourself to feel the loss, but just know slowly overtime, things will improve. I’m so sorry for your loss",1

1-800-273-TALK (8255) or 988  


https://988lifeline.org  


The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline is a national network of local crisis centers that provides free and confidential emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the United States. We're committed to improving crisis services and advancing suicide prevention by empowering individuals, advancing professional best practices, and building awareness.",1
19218,ww0n0o,p_iynx,"Oh my gosh Alexa, I’m so sorry for your loss. I’m heartbroken for you, and I wish I could give you a big hug! I’m also sorry that your parents are so closed-minded, you deserved so much more from them. When they chose to have a child, they should have committed to loving that child regardless of their sexuality. You did nothing wrong, you weren’t hurting anyone by being queer. 

First, let’s do a self care check:

-	Have you eaten something nourishing and had enough water recently? 
-	Have you taken your prescribed medications (if you have any)? 
-	Do you need to take a shower/bath? 
-	Have you gotten any physical activity (even if it’s just a 5 minute walk or good stretch)? 
-	When was the last time you were outside (even if it was just to sit in the sunshine for a couple minutes)? 

I know it’s probably really hard to do the basics to take care of yourself right now, but letting those go too much will make you feel worse. Neglecting them can also impact your sleep. 

It might benefit you to look into grief support groups. Depending on where you live, there may even be LGBTQ+ specific support groups, and on Facebook there are LGBTQ+ grief/loss support groups as well that you can join. If you’re not sure where to find in-person groups, contact a LGBTQ+ resource center in your state/region and they may be able to point you in the right direction. 

Individual therapy is also a good idea, if you have access to therapy. If you can’t afford it, a lot of therapists offer sliding-scale fees that can decrease the cost depending on your income. You can look for therapists that are LGBTQ+ accepting, there are many websites that maintain lists of safe therapists in a specific area. Telehealth appointments with therapists further away are also an option, if you can’t find any in your area. 

If you have friends or acquaintances you trust, please don’t be afraid to ask for help! People who care about you want to provide support, even if you aren’t super close. Ask someone to meet for coffee, or to hang out at the park. If someone you know has an affectionate dog or cat, ask to hang out with them and their pet so you can get some cuddles. Honestly, finding *any* excuse to get out of the house is helpful when you’re grieving. It’s very easy to end up self-isolating, where you end up just wallowing in pain and grief. Getting fresh air and seeing the sunshine (and other people) can honestly help a lot. 

As for sleep, you can try putting a heating pad (like the microwave or electric ones) in her pillow, maybe wrapping it in clothes that still smell like her, and hugging it or putting it against your back so you can feel warmth there. Playing some sort of ambient noise, relaxing music, an audio book, guided meditation, etc might also help. Melatonin melts (I use the Natrol brand myself, they work amazingly well) can be very effective when taken 30-60 mins before you want to sleep. Get some movement and sunlight during the day and that will also help your body feel tired properly at night. 

Most importantly, be kind to yourself. Show yourself the same grace that you would show a grieving friend. It’s okay if you need to just do the bare minimum at work or around the house while you navigate this situation. If you are eligible for FMLA, you may be able to take leave for grief counseling/depression if you’re really having a hard time. Don’t feel guilty about using resources available to you. Please let me know if you ever need to talk!",1

19311,upjmxp,spoopadoop,"How I coped? Lots of crying honestly 😂 But I would set aside 2-3 hours of studying every night right before bed!! On Weekends I would force myself to wake up no later than 10:30 to get my studying done before any of my roommates woke up and began making the typical weekend noise!

I'm a visual learner (Hence the fine arts major too) so making flash cards with color coded notes or making my OWN diagrams helped so much!! I also always handwrite my notes, and when I'm studying for an exam I'll rewrite my notes and reword my definitions too!",3

19314,upjmxp,momvetty,"Architecture.  You don’t need in depth science but it definitely helps to have the bent towards science.  

In art, you learn proportions and what makes things beautiful.

I found it to be a well rounded education and career.  There are other areas that can satisfy your strengths as well.  Product design, prosthetics, etc., areas that require someone with science and art abilities.

Feel free to DM me or ask further questions here.

P.s. I also got a degree in nursing after.  Not because I didn’t like architecture, but because of life events.",3

19353,yf07cm,_I_need_tree_fiddy_,"I had a surgery two years ago and mostly had to go it alone. Only had someone pick me up. It was scary, but I did it. I had to have the same surgery just today and this time I had someone with me that is supportive and loves me. I was so thankful to have him with me, but it also made me realize how brave I was last time, doing it all alone. I didn’t even tell my mom about the surgery last time and I’m no contact with her this time. Sometimes we can be our own parent and champion. 

You’re brave. You’re doing what you need to do to take care of yourself. I know it can be scary sometimes, but you’re strong, obviously. I’m proud of you. I wish you a speedy recovery. Take this time to rest. You don’t need to do anything else. Sending hugs!!",297

I am deeply saddened, as a mother, that you’re navigating through this journey without the unconditional love and support of your mother. I’m sorry she hasn’t evolved  enough yet to set her ignorance aside and just love and be there for her baby who needs her the most.  

I’m the offspring of a self-centered malignant narcissist as well.  I, unfortunately, truly understand the pain and rejection you feel. 

I am proud of you, love. It’s okay to be scared. Repeat after me: *”It’s okay to not be okay.“*

Take deep breaths, sip some water, eat (follow the doctor’s dietary guidelines/restrictions though ❤️). 

You’ve completed a big step in your journey. That should be celebrated with funny videos (try not to laugh too hard and bust a stitch), cute animal pictures and videos and maybe a pudding cup (only if the doctor says it’s okay). 

You’re loved here. I love you.  Remember to breathe.",81

19361,yf07cm,dreamlandtv,"older trans brother here: here's my wisdom. 

the thing with being us is that no matter how we live, there's always going to be someone with their nose in our identity. there will always be someone who is bothered by us just existing. so here's what i've learned: you're not existing for them, you're existing for you. and at times it's going to be difficult and you're going to wonder what you did wrong. and you did nothing wrong at all; sometimes, it's just hard to exist.   
  
and it's hard to learn, but you've got to realize you're not existing for them. you're existing for you. and some people won't be okay with that. and your mum may never be okay with it. but i promise you this: there are plenty of people who are, and legions more who are proud of you for being you. that, i think, is the hardest part of all of this. just being yourself. 

but you're doing it, and i'm so proud of you. 

love and identity has always been and will always be a war, unfortunately. but if you stop fighting for the people who don't care and start fighting for you, i think you'll find you might just win.

you're doing amazing, and as your trans older brother, i am *so so proud of you.* you've got this, big man. the world is yours, and we're all so proud.

You are not alone at all! Being your mom for a minute - I must say that you have more support than you know.  I am a cis gender mom of two boys, one who I think is bi. I will tell you this - there is nothing that could make me not love him. There are several things I might not like about him (like if he ever kicked dogs or punched babies), but I will always love him. He will always be my baby, and the only way I'd leave his side is if he didn't want me there.

I also have a high school friend who went from a girl to a boy. She was the most insecure person I've met. She wanted to crawl inside of herself and was recluse. HE. however, is the happiest outgoing person! He is a real joker, outgoing, dedicated father there is! He got married a few years back and is living his best life! His wife and kid are renovating their new home, and have a plethora of pets. (Which they love!)

Where do we start? You've overcome so much already, and you're well on your way to becoming your best and truest, happiest self. That's all any mama would want for their baby, unfortunately not all of us can make peace enough within ourselves to accept that. 

I know it's tough when ""real"" parents do not understand or accept you or your feelings, but for every parent who can't meet you where you are, there are many of us already there, waiting to take over and love you extra. Beyond that, there is a whole world out there full of opportunities to meet and create meaningful bonds with other people who you choose. 

Times like right now are hard to deal with, the feelings are heavy and overwhelming but you will start to feel better again. Until then, we are here. We hear you, we support and love you and we will keep you company. Feel free to DM me if you need to talk more. Just try to breathe and rest as much as you can. 🖤",2

19407,yf07cm,HelloRedditAreYouOk,"My love, my sweet sweet duckling… sometimes in life we have to shed big parts of ourselves the way a caterpillar does, to emerge on the other side the bright and beautiful butterflies we truly are… it can be scary, and painful, and so uncertain. That is normal and you are so so brave to keep making choices that will help your happiness, even when your bio mom can’t support it.

The scariness and the uncertainty are necessary parts of truly transforming ourselves, too... it is not easy to live your truth and these trials that test our resolve are like a crash course advanced degree in self-realization. Through the fire and in to your bright future, my sweet boy… don’t doubt for even a moment how worthy of happiness and love and support you are. I am here for you… *we* are here for you, and always will be. 

So as you shed the physical aspects of your self that do not serve you, let it be ok to also shed your bio mom’s ability to harm you. You are safe, you are loved, you are perfectly imperfect, and you deserve so so SO much credit for getting yourself to where you are. Onwards and upwards, duckie. I love you always/all ways,

You just did such a tremendous act of courage in validating your identity and who you are. You are living your truth. I know how it hurts to feel unloved by who birthed you. It takes a lot of time to heal from that.

Take it easy honeybee. Make sure you're getting rest, water, and that you don't strain your incisions too much. If they give you pain medicine, get some stool softener since they can really back you up. Also, pack yourself in with pillows at night so you don't roll over and hurt an incision.

It has also taken me about 4 months to start feeling more like my normal self - sleeping like my post surgery self, energy like my post surgery self.  And in my case, being more mobile like my post surgery self.  

Given what surgery you had, and that you are on your transition road to becoming outwardly male to match your inner self, I'd think/assume that there are a TON of emotions whirling through you, and being barely 48 hours post surgery only makes it worse and make you feel horribly out of mental control.

Son, let me tell you an old saying that I heard a good while back- 

“The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb”

Now, you may have heard a similar saying, but that there’s the original.

Your mother may have given birth to you, but that don’t mean a damn thing if she don’t love you like a mother. She chose to have you, and if she ain’t gonna love and accept the child she went through the trouble of creatin’, then that’s her own damn fault.

You ain’t doin’ nothin’ wrong, boy. What went wrong is your mother failed you.

It don’t matter none who the sonofabitch beatin’ you down is, you don’t owe them your love. Your mama done chose her path, now you keep on goin’ down yours. You ain’t gonna get very far down a road if you keep tryin’ to turn around.

Take care of yourself, son, and remember, my door’s always open should you need to stop by for a spell.

I'm so proud of you. 

You have every right to be who you are, take up space in this world, live your authentic truth, and demand the medical care you require for your well-being. 

A big part of doing the brave thing is that low point of not feeling brave, of feeling alone and scared and desperate. It's human. 

You're there now, and you'll be there again. 

But you did the bravest thing of all - you asked for help. You decided to bend before you break. 

I'm proud of you.

It's hard when you didn't get that love from your mom, and it puts your heart in survival mode. 

But all around, there are people who want to know you, want to help you, want to love you. 

The greatest joy in life is learning to love and be loved in return, and it's my greatest hope for you.

I have a lot of muscle strength to recover, but that’s just an annoyance for me.  I can look back and see how much that pain had restricted me, even if I didn’t see at the time.  I hope you are able to look back in, say a years time, and know it was a jump to get over, to endure, (along with rest of the transition issues), and see that you have come through the worst of it.

19626,s7whw6,wwitchiepoo,"Yes, my love! They are the very best at this. In high school my bf broke up with me on the phone and I cried so hard I puked. My kitty never left my lap. She had puke on her and just kept purring and comforting me. She lived to be 22 and even did this with my own kids. 

She’s just showing her empathy. That’s what the purr is for. It calms her and other cats, so she’s using her magic on you. Most animas don’t have a positive reinforcement sound, one that said “I love you, too!”  Kitties do. She knows it. She shows it. Never forget how special you are to her! Science says she lowers blood pressure and evens your heart rate, and that purr releases endorphins in you both. Can’t fight the science! Or those purrs!",6

After that she just sat there with me for like 2 hours and shortly afterwards I was able to pass the stones. 
So yes I think this is purrfectly normal as cats are actually fat fuzzy little angels.",4
19630,s7whw6,,"It's 100% normal. Cats are very protective of their humans and want them to be happy. 

I bet kitty does that thing where (s)he rubs the edge of their jaw against your face/hand/ankle too. When they do that, they're marking you as their property.

There are two prevailing theories about why cats bring prey to their humans:

1) They're trying to feed you because they're grateful that you've been feeding them.

2) They're trying to say, ""See, stupid? That's what you're *supposed* to do."" 

Personally, I prefer the second theory. Seems more cat-like to me.",3

They are also really good at reading our moods. Depending on the cats personality it's totally normal for them to comfort you when you are sick or sad.

When the favorite human is sad or upset about things or sick, they cuddle, lick, knead, and love all over us.  In my case, I am the favorite human for maybe 7 or 8 of the cats, so they take turns, one cuddles and purrs, then the next one, then that one hops down and the next one.

It's awesome.  It means you are their human, part of their clowder (that's a thing!) and they are trying to make you better.  I love cats!!!

Baby boy cat will follow them around the house and flop down at their feet and attempt to look as sad and/or cute as possible until he gets picked up and then will shove his face in their neck. Big girl cat will wait until they're alone and pin people's arm down and purr ferociously until they look less sad... Or pet her more. She's easily bribed.

I had a ginger boy from 2001 until 2012, and he was an empath too. I still have a dilute tortie girl born in 2006 I'm pretty sure she learned it from him, and she still does it. When they were both alive, my lap and chest could get pretty crowded when I was sad. 

My mom's ginger cat, although he'll sit on your lap if he's cold, has never been interested in snuggling with anyone when they're sad except for my mom. If mom was upset, and she frequently was after her diagnosis, he magically materialized out of nowhere and plopped down on her lap and made biscuits until she stopped crying. He was a good kitty for her.

I moved from the bed to the sofa and back again. I needed to replenish my iron and fluids. The second week, my hormones were trying to regulate themselves so I had a lot of headaches.

It sounds like you’re doing an excellent job supporting her and yourself. Things are going to be tough for a while — possibly a long while. A grief counselor is a great start, and your local hospital or church may offer a miscarriage support group that may help both of you.

In the meantime, invite family and friends to share your pain and help hold you up - I guarantee they’ll be happy to lend a listening ear, company, or some help around the house while you heal.

You are doing the right things, and have good advice here. The advice I don’t see is that YOU are also grieving and need support and comfort.

Your wife is suffering the medical and hormonal fallout of the miscarriage, which is important to keep in mind, but you BOTH are suffering the loss. Your emotional health is equally as important as your wife’s. 

You may encounter people who don’t realize that you are also suffering, and I’m so sorry. If you have your own support system of friends and family, now is a good time to let them know if you need them. It sounds like y’all may need someone to bring meals, which is a common way to support a grieving family.

There is no right or wrong way to grieve. Just ride the grief and let yourself process at your own pace and in your own way. Let yourself feel whatever you need to feel, and cry or don’t or pace or walk or scream - however you are motivated to process. Talk to your wife: both of y’all give and receive support and validation from each other. Y’all will get through this *together*.",14
19739,ycnze3,nugforever,"The most important thing anyone ever did for me was hold space for whatever I was feeling. My grief was jagged and overwhelming, and some people handled it better than others. Give her support, but remember that you are grieving too. Your loss isn't less, just different, and you deserve space for your grief too. If she can't do that for you right now, remember to reach out to friends and loved ones. Let them know you're hurting and need support, and let them know if you need help supporting your wife.

Our journey has now spanned over two years and included a long battle with PTSD symptoms associated with the miscarriage. It's okay to not be okay. Find a therapist or counselor to support you, and seek out someone knowledgeable about trauma if either of you find the experience becoming overwhelming or intrusive. It's okay to feel whatever you are feeling, but definitely give yourselves a chance to process things before you decide what to do next. We eventually realized that we both needed to pour our energy into healing our mental health, and I had to confront a lot of fears and misconceptions that I didn't even realize I had. We eventually decided to not try again, in part because the risk of another equally traumatic miscarriage is extremely high in our case. We have been through enough, and we will figure out a fulfilling life without children. It's okay to try again if it feels right to do so, but it's equally valid to say, no, we won't try again. Be kind to yourselves and know that whatever you decide to do, that's perfectly fine.",12

I’ve had a few MC’s myself and it is the hardest thing to go through because sometimes you don’t know what will help make you feel better, at least I didn’t know what I needed. I would’ve appreciated being asked how I am, having dinner made for me, help with housework, back rubs, sometimes no touching at all. Ask your wife what she needs. If she’s unable to tell you, just take her lead. It hurts both physically and emotionally. Even after a few weeks or months, keep asking how she’s doing (sporadically). It’s nice to know you’re still thought of and the baby you had is still thought of.

19747,ycnze3,FARTS_ARE_NORMAL,"I'm so sorry for what you're going through. I've personally had a number of miscarriages. Everyone handles it differently, but each time I felt surprisingly vulnerable. Sometimes I just needed to be physically close to someone, just be held. It sounds like you're already doing that for her. 

Keep in mind too, not only is she going through the emotional challenge of processing this, but also experiencing hormone withdrawal. Most women go through the 'baby blues' after they deliver, where they are often very depressed and prone to crying easily. This also happens with miscarriage, and obviously without the happy counterbalance of a baby. To be clear, I'm not saying her emotions are because of her hormones, just that they're adding cruel insult to injury. In my experiences with my losses, I knew I was just going to be sad and sometimes inconsolable for 1-2 weeks before I was even going to think like myself enough to truly process the grief. I offer this in case it's helpful with what to expect. 

Give yourselves patience and time, and lean into each other. Ask her what she wants and needs, there's no right answer. No easy answers in this situation either. *Hugs*.",6

Brush her hair. Sleep. 

Look for the love under the wave. Look for the beautiful things like kindness and helpers. Listen. Ask her if she wants a memorial. Mourning hurts. It’s okay to feel this way. It’s okay to be under the wave. The intensity will relent. And sometimes it will crash in hard. Hold each other and feel. 

I’m sorry for the loss of your baby. No words can lessen the pain. Under the wave is hard. Feel all the feelings you both have. Take care of yourself as much as possible. Pour in to each other. Let the tears flow. Get help from helpful people. Do what you need to to mourn.

TL(or dry)DR: Her body most likely still carries the DNA from your pregnancy. The cells from a fetus find their way into the mother's body during pregnancy regardless of the outcome of the pregnancy. The DNA can be detected within the mother years afterward. Current thinking is that those cells change the mother's immune system and maybe brain too.

I found a beautiful picture and put my ultrasound photo behind it in the frame and put it in our family room that way the little one is always with us.  Whatever she needs to remember your little one let her do.  Love her.  Hug her.  Be there.  There is no more than that.,3
19772,ycnze3,DianeJudith,"Just be with her. That's all that matters. But remember that you are grieving too. If you need help, please allow yourself to ask for support. It can be from her, but you can also ask your family and best friend.",3

19775,ycnze3,spinnerette_,"I have never gone through this, but as a woman I will tell you what I would like my fiance to do in this situation. Take over the medical calls whenever possible, try to take over some of the duties around the house like cooking and cleaning, start her a bath and ask if she would like you to sit with her or leave her to relax, massages. Just be present. Check in with her. We are less likely to put effort into caring for ourselves when we are grieving.

But please understand you are also going through this loss. You aren't superman. Some people, myself included, will process grief in a very delayed way. I will clean the entire house, cook every meal, etc. The second I stop moving, I break. Allow yourself to feel. I'm so incredibly sorry this happened.",4
19776,ycnze3,CadenceQuandry,"A multiple miscarriage survivor here.  Fwiw.  

Being there.  Or not.   Giving her time to cry on your shoulder, but also space to be alone if she needs it.  I personally wanted to mostly be alone.  It was just what I needed in those moments.   Plus, I was worried that my grief would simply be way too my for my husband.   Once he went back to work I often screamed in the shower just to let it out.  If he was home, I'd just sit and sob in the shower.  

Express your own grief too.  It's ok to do that.   Understand that once the physical part is over that it will take a lot longer for the emotional part.   It could be a few weeks.  Or a few months.   Up to a year even.   And expect tough days in your due date and on the anniversary of the loss.    

She may want to try again soon.    You'll both need to de ode if you wish to do so.  Don't just agree in order to make her happy.   

For the moment tho - her favorite foods.  Especially things you aren't supposed to eat while pregnant!   Sushi.   Sweets.   Wine or whatever alcohol she enjoys.  Rare steak or burgers.     Just anything that tells her you are thinking about her even in the small details.  

A journal for her to write in.  Maybe there's a grief journal to be had someplace.    

Connecting her with a group of women who have also suffered loss.   There are lots of subreddits or online groups for women who've had a pregnancy loss.   

Letting her know that her feelings, whatever they are, are valid.  She may feel sad one moment, then happy the next, then guilty for being happy.   Let her know that whatever she's feeling that you are there for it all no matter what.  

For me it helped to name my lost children.  Gale, Grace/Grayson, Cecily, Angel, Robin, and Wren.   Robin was our toughest loss at 13 weeks.  

Look up the circle of grief.   Don't allow people to vent their grief to your wife.   People should only ever vent outwards in the circle, never inwards.   

Don't let people say stupid things to her without stepping in.  

- oh it all happens for a reason - no.  No it doesn't.    There is nowhere in the Bible that says this.   

-oh it's for the best, that baby wouldn't have been healthy!  - ok?   Who cares.  THIS baby was already loved and wanted regardless.  

- oh why are you upset?   It was barely a cluster of cells?  - science shows that a pregnancy loss at any stage hits as hard as a late pregnancy loss or childbirth loss.   If you think otherwise then you obviously haven't read the research

- oh you can always try again next month or next year - we will cross that road when we come to it.   For now, please just sit with us in our grief and support us instead of rugsweeping how we feel.  

People try to be kind and try to say the right things.  But grief and especially pregnancy loss makes people uncomfortable and we are a society that abhors discomfort.  Most people avoid it at all costs.   That's why most people don't even know how to just sit beside someone experiencing grief.   They have zero clue how to act or what to say beyond trite and hurtful sayings often.  So don't be too offended.   But also let your wife know that those trite sayings that hurt her heart are not ok and that you see and feel both her pain and your own.  

I'm so sorry for your loss.  The loss of hopes and dreams.   The loss of a future with a child you had come to live and be joyful for.   The loss of a spirit that surrounded you.   The loss of the expectations that the experience of being a parent would have for you.  I'm sorry for the pain.    And the sorrow.  

Know that many couple experience loss.  You are in no way alone, though it may feel that way.   At least 1/4 of all couples experience a miscarriage.    

Gentle hugs for both of you.   My heart breaks for you.",5

First, make sure she is eating. Doesn't matter what as long as she eats something. And you too. Eat whatever you are feeling like. I only wanted cinnamon buns. So that's what I ate.

Second, you both could, or one of you could, feel this loss for a very long time. 

Third, figure out where you are going to go from here. You mentioned that you had planned to be child free but then warmed up to this unexpected pregnancy. You both may now want a child, one of you may want a child and the other may not. But this is a conversation you need to have. I would have it soon. Our baby was planned so I don't have advice here. 

Fourth, this isn't either of your faults. This unfortunately happens and unfortunately happens often. 1 in 4 will have a pregnancy loss, and they think that the number is even higher because so many people will have an early loss and will never know. 
It was likely caused due to a trisomy that was incompatible with life. 


Take your time grieving but it does get better. And it does get easier. And that's ok. It is ok to move forward with your life.

This will be one of the strangest losses you will ever experience. You are grieving something that never existed on this earth. Something you never physically saw, touched etc, but that you loved more than you can describe. It's a difficult type of loss. And people who haven't been through it do not understand. Ignore them.

People that you didn't know had gone through this will reach out to you. Utilize them when you need them. 

You will be shocked by what some people say. Again. Ignore them. 

Again. I'm sorry you're going through this. 

There is a subrebbit r/miscarriage that might be able to help as well.

She may pull away physically  due to this for awhile, and thats okay, she just went through severe trauma and needs her heart to heal before she may feel comfortable again. Its important to remember she could feel the changes in her body and might have felt that flicker of connection that there is a life growing in me.. and now that is gone.... you will probably see her resting her hand on her stomach subconsciously only to break down when the stark realization hits.

When my friend miscarried we were both  thankful we  had gotten to celebrate and could mourn together.

Try to have water and something to eat, just something to keep you safe. Your wife has been through a lot of stress physically, she especially needs to stay hydrated, fed and well rested. A little bit is better than nothing at all.
There’s not much that can be said to take away the pain or make this easier. Continue to be with her, let her know she’s not alone. 
Don’t forget to take care of yourself as well. If you need to cry, let it out.
It sounds like you two have a wonderful support system with friends and family. If possible lean on them for support and comfort. 

Your hospital or OBGYN may have resources for long term counseling and support groups in your area. 

A friend recently lost a child and there was an online support group for mothers who’ve lost children. The group teaches parents coping skills and provides support from a person who’s been through it. If you feel ready you can become a mentor to another parent  and help them through. I can try and find the program name if you’d like.

There’s no right way to feel or grieve. There will be  good days and bad days, stick by each other throughout.

Sending you both lots of love.

Gently encourage her to eat & drink. Offer to order in/make her favorite comfort foods. Make sure to bring her tissues and a glass of water after she's cried. She'll most likely not be interested in eating, so don't push too hard. Just let her know you're there to take care of her.

See to her physical comfort as you can - ask if you can make her more comfortable by fluffing pillows/getting blankets/making sure all the bedding is fresh & clean/getting her into her favorite jammies. I've been stuck-in-bed grief stricken, and it was a huge comfort to have someone brush my hair, tuck me into a freshly made bed, and put warm socks on me.

19830,ycnze3,VioletJessopTravelCo,"You keep holding her. And you keep telling her how much you love her. Cry with her, don't suppress your emotions. Yes, she is the one experiencing the added physical trauma of losing a baby that far into her pregnancy, but both of you are experiencing the emotional trauma of losing a baby. So cry with her too. And hold her. And let her know that you do not blame her, that none of this was her fault. 

Make sure that you have additional support that you can go to for comfort as well. Keep an eye out on your wife's physical symptoms (excessive bleeding, high blood pressure, blurry vision with a headache...) and take her back to the hospital if anything physically concerning is happening. You should be able to call her OBGYNs office at any time (day, night, weekend, holiday) and get connected with the doctor on call. They should be able to give medical advice over the phone if the hospital or Dr office do not have an advice nurse. 

DRINK WATER!!! I know you don't have an appetite, and neither does she. That's ok, but you both need to make sure you are staying hydrated. Soup would be a good way to help stay hydrated and also get some sustenance.

 Ask close family or friends or neighbors to bring some easy premade dishes. My husband's disabled sister passed away earlier this month and we stayed with his family while she was in hospice and a while after her passing. Neighbors brought over meals right out of their oven ready to eat. It made everything just a bit easier to not have to worry about trying to think of making dinner or something like that. All we needed to do was reheat it and eat it and that made it much easier on us.

I am so sorry this has happened to you both.",1
19831,ycnze3,mortuali,Keep hugging her as much as she can stand. It'll help you both. I just had a few tears for you too. I'm real sorry.,1
19832,ycnze3,grannygogo,"When she’s ready to venture outside, look for signs.  A ladybug landing on her, a butterfly, a cardinal. Whatever.  Then whenever something like that happens think of your baby and know he/she is near.   It’s silly, but definitely a small comfort.  Also don’t decide for her when the grieving period should be over.  Let her feel how she feels in her own time frame.  It will be especially difficult around the time your child would have been born.   Sending both of you love.",1
19833,ycnze3,scoby-dew,"It sounds like you're both taking all the right steps.  Keep supporting each other emotionally and do get counseling. You're both going to be delicate for a while so just feel your feelings.

She does have the extra burden of the physical trauma of the loss, so be understanding as she'll probably take longer to get back to functional.  There is no set timeline for grief or healing. 

I also imagine that early ambivalence about the pregnancy may be fueling some of the emotional distress. Those feelings, along with subsequent acceptance and excitement are totally valid.  Emotions are messy.  Coming to grips with a future you'd never planned for and having it taken away is cruel beyond words.

Love each other and do the best you can.

19838,ycnze3,bigbertha998,"When I was going through a different grief looking back alot of the trauma is blocked but what I do remember is his comfort and going through it with me. He would crawl in behind me running his fingers through my hair and I play with my ears as a soothing thing and so he did that, ran his fingers over my back.. held me as I cried. he turned to every soothing action he knew. So you just need to be with her.. and know that you are grieving too.. so be gentle with yourself as well. 

Order take out as others said, I think if you have the money you should do a couple small Amazon purchases for soothing.. like a big heated blanket that you two can curl up under.. something that smells comforting.. something that meets the essentials.. there's stick on trash bags that you can stick to the side of the bed and that way stuff is being thrown out when neither of you have the energy to function.. dry shampoo if she's not able to shower.. shower stuff if she finds the shower soothing.. if you're worried about what you both are getting nutrient wise look at something similar to evolve.. it's a supplement that's supposed to give you anything you might be lacking... If you're worried that she won't eat take out you can do protein shakes, ghost has some really yummy ones.. I'm a person when dealing with stress or grief I struggle to eat at times so having that helped me. 

The grief counselor was a great move on your part even if they have to come later. I'm so sorry for your loss.. for the pain.. and I am so proud of you for taking care of you two.. you love her and that'll help carry you guys through. 


This part is something for the future not anytime soon and is very dependent on how you guys feel down the road.. but there are tons of grief products... there's a woman who makes a weighted baby based off of the child you lost.. for some mom's it was being able to hold the baby they either never got to hold or lost.. there's teddybears with the heartbeat..there's another woman who makes replicas of where they were at with molds so even the earliest loss.. and there's others who use ashes or ultrasounds.. there are people out there that can work with anything you have or don't have in a variety of ways. This is not helpful for every person, for some it's too painful and for some it's a tribute and sometimes a way to process the grief. I just wanted you to know that there is grief work out there if you decide that's something for your personal loss. 

Lastly, again later down the road.. something that helped us process the trauma was a rage room. Often they have packages and if you still have more to let out you can purchase individual items to break like a washer.

I know there is nothing that will take the pain away, and I'm so deeply sorry. It's a heartbreak that even words can't touch.. so I'm sending my love for you both as you weather this storm together, you're doing great as you are, none of my suggestions are necessary just being there is the only thing that truly matters💓",1
19839,ycnze3,mad_fishmonger,"I'm sorry, I can't even imagine. Sending you both so much love right now. Remember so long as you're not hurting people or animals there's no wrong way to grieve. Do what your heart needs.",1
19840,ycnze3,randominternetuser46,"Hey sib!

Run to store / order delivery and grab some liquid IV/ Gatorade or Pedialyte. Grab some chapstick ( put this on lips and nose) and the expensive tissues. Grab whatever comfort food is for you two. Grab one or two magazines for distraction when she's ready. Put on her favorite show for noise in the background.- quietly .

Name your baby. Hold one another and talk. There is no right or wrong here. There's a loss of what could have been and what you hoped for. Grief is not set stages and no two people grieve the same. All you can do is be there for one another. 

Something you will find:
Loss and grief comes in waves. It drowns you in the beginning and you struggle to find air, to find the world, the waves drag you under and the riptide rips your soul out of you. With time, you learn how to fight and come up for air, then how to swim and head toward shore and back to a new sense of normal with the waves still lapping around you. Sometimes chocking you when you least expect it. And finally, you make it to shore and you stand and you see the world right side up ... But the waves are still there lapping at your feet. Even when you leave the beach, you still see the shoreline....
That's grief. All you can do is make sure you fight to come up for air and keep fighting and swimming to shore. 

Some wise words a friend gave me- tough times don't last, tough people do. This is one of those. All you can do is breathe and know that time doesn't heal all wounds, but it helps it to close. Be sad. Cry with her. Be upset however you need. A grief counselor is good, but remember it won't take this pain away, just give you means to cope with these big emotions. 

You have this. It may not feel like it right now, but you do. 

Sending light and love.",1

19842,ycnze3,CheekyCheesehead,"I’m so sorry. Sit with her. Be in the grief with her. Don’t look away from the pain. I think you’re doing all of the right things. 

When I had a miscarriage, it was physically painful, too. Depending on how far along she is, it feels like somewhere between a bad period and actually giving birth. So be sure to get her pads, medicine, warming pads for her cramps, ice, etc. I’d also find some really soft, comforting items like super comfortable sweat pants, blankets, and things like that. 

Last, I would suggest moving the baby things out of her sight- maybe to a closet or something like that. The last thing she needs is a reminder that they won’t be used. 

Hang in there and remember, your feelings are valid and important too. You lost a baby too.",1

19846,ycnze3,famousraymous, Not much else you can do unfortunately just be there for her and encourage her (when she’s ready) to reach out to friends or a therapist. My wife and I were in exactly the same position two years ago and we still struggle with the grief but when she told friends/family about what had happened some would confide in her about similar experiences and were able to bond and talk about it. It’s such a shame that so many women go through that and have to go right back to work as if nothing had happened and sometimes just knowing someone close to you has been in a similar situation and talking about it can really help. So sorry for your loss. We commonly get asked when we’re having kids and I find it such an offensive question because a lot of people don’t know what we’ve been through and how it has affected us.,1

I bought some customized memorial jewelry off of Etsy that brought me some comfort. Then to get out of the house we went and bought some furniture, just to get out. A few weeks later it was Mother’s Day, so we planted a tree in the baby’s honor.

He did this exactly. 
 I could tell you what he did but that’s a story in itself. 
 But through all of the grieving process he’s been my rock. Our rock.
 And that is all she’ll need. EVERYTHING. 
 You’ll need to make sure you find time to take care you yourself, time to have an outlet. Set that one boundary like a night a week out or gaming or whatever you do. (But maybe try to be flexible.) 
 Those day’s will lessen and lessen and eventually it turns into just moments, and heads up they’ll start big, but often the big ones come out of nowhere. 
(For example in my situation the hospital kept sending mail for milestones like his birthday or death day (it’s what we call it. We don’t know what else to call if….I’m sorry if that’s crude…. So those would always ruin our moments.. but one you get to a place where you can smile looking at your lives together and feel stronger because you’ve been through it together….
 You’ve got a village once you’ve found each other I guess even if you don’t have other people in that village, get people, look into therapy that you can get, hospitals are great resources for grief therapy, and grief groups….. and that’s what you need!!!

19886,ycnze3,abluetruedream,"OP, This is great advice.

Things are a little different for the mom for all these reasons listed: hormones, loss of blood, etc. And although you’ve been right along with her in this pregnancy and loss journey, there are added elements that are sometimes unique to a woman in this situation. There is a sense of wonder that can accompany your changing body as your pregnancy progresses and on the other side, there can be an irrational sense of guilt associated with a miscarriage, for example.

*But* this baby was just as much yours as it was hers. Additionally, it can be really terrifying when our spouse is having significant bleeding. Even if you suspected the miscarriage there could still be an element of fear for your wife’s safety. I’d encourage you to hold space for her to grieve this loss, but also know that you need to grieve as well. Even if you feel you need to put it on pause for a little bit, please spend time reflecting on this eventually. 

Hopefully, your wife will be able to sometimes hold space for your grief as well and that you will both be able to find a way to grieve together.

In the mean time, prioritize the basic needs: food, sleep, some simple hygiene. Take it day by day.",11

19891,ycnze3,yeast510,Thank you. Lots of small naps and back rubs today for both of us. We probably didn't drink enough water but we did try. Crying really does take a lot of energy,7

19893,ycnze3,yeast510,"Her parents are close by but I think they're really grieving too. This would have been their only grandchild so I think my wife has taken a lot of responsibility for this happening which I'm just heart broken for her. I tell her that it's not her fault, but it's hard for her to shake those intrusive thoughts. 
My brother and his wife had food delivered to us today which was amazing. Especially since they're not that close by and have demanding jobs and two children of their own. 
As the days go by I'll reach out to my buddy, but he's near an hour away. For now I'm just trying to focus on my wife's emotional health",8
19894,ycnze3,yeast510,Thank you. I'm worried how this will physically affect her for sure. Her pain tolerance is very low and it just breaks my heart to see her in pain,5

19898,ycnze3,yeast510,"Thank you. I'm kinda numb. I've gone through so many emotions today but honestly I feel like my deepest emotions have been sadness and anger. I'm sad for our loss, but even more sad for how sad she is. Seeing her this way just breaks my heart, and I'm angry that this has happened to her. I just want to take the pain away.  She doesn't deserve this. She is the sweetest person and should only have good things happen to her.",5

19914,ycnze3,closingbelle,"If you have not lost a child, please don't be judgemental about ANY of this, truly. That's a big no here.

This is easily one of the hardest things any parent will go through. Some are rational and that can be hard to process for the more emotional partner. No one here is ""condoning"" anything, we're trying to be really sincere in helping someone prepare so that they don't take the anger personally, because it's a secondary emotional response that the person may have zero control over, because, again, no one knows how they will react in this situation until you've survived it. This comment is just saying you need to give your partner tons of grace and room and whatever they need, especially if you're the ""less obviously emotional"" one. Which is really silly, everyone's brain processes trauma differently.

&nbsp;

Please don't do this here, it's just not helping anyone and makes you look clueless. It's also agenda pushing, which is against our rules and will get you banned. You're right, no one SHOULD, but no one SHOULD suffer the loss of a child, and yet here we are. The only thing you can do is be prepared and then heal after the crisis if both people are able to. But you cannot dictate or judge what happens within a relationship when this occurs, especially from the outside, on Reddit of all things.",36

I'm so glad you made that post, too!

20004,t3fndo,Schattentochter,"Hey there, sis.

I was one of the ones who commented - and I want to leave you with a few hopefully helpful and comforting thoughts:

1. Your feelings are valid. Your sadness is valid. A breakup, even from someone who sucks, is still a breakup - and love doesn't become unreal just because we realize it wasn't given to the right person.

2. The big AND - a concept from Cognitive Behaviorial Therapy - is your friend now. He acted like a jerk that night **and** you had moments that lead to you loving him. He showed a lot of red flags **and** did some things at times that made you happy. These don't exclude each other, they do not cancel each other out. They can absolutely coexist and all the feelings they evoke have their place.

3. Be proud of yourself!! The part where they sound sad and lovebomb is the hardest to stay strong for. Kind people and loving people prefer to have hope, they don't want to mistreat or misjudge somebody so a genuine-sounding apology can break our hearts. But remember - an apology does neither undo damage done nor does it mean anything if what follows doesn't set it into stone. You can forgive him and not want to date him anymore - you can seek distance and not feel responsible for asking the question as well. It is not your responsibility to fix him or to forgive him. It is his to be better and never cause this harm again. To you, however, he has already done it and what you make of that is yours and yours alone to decide. His apology can mean something to you and still not lead to the consequences he wants - namely you back in his life and under his coercion. - It doesn't matter who he will be. Who he was that night was someone unsafe and you deserve to be safe *always*.

4. You did nothing more and nothing less than keeping a human being safe. There is not ever any fault in that. Even if ""potential"" goes untapped - you do not owe potential anything. Nor hope. Nor doubt. Certainties outrule them all and the one thing that was certain here is that the car thing happened and that the red flags were all there.


5. This will hurt for a while and doubt will happen. It always does. But that is okay. You get to doubt - as long as, at the end of it, you stick to your guns. You did the right thing. Trust yourself with this always.

6. From where I stand, as an outsider, I'm not too happy to empathize with him but I also know as the person who left, that is a different story - so remember: We are not doing anyone a favour by enabling their toxicity. Ever. If you find yourself wondering if you were ""cruel"" to him, remember that he *has to be better* and getting away with this would never lead to that.



And last but not least: Thank you. Thank you for not keeping someone around an abuser and making them suffer because of it. Thank you for saving a living human from so much pain. You deserved protection and I am glad you provided it for yourself.


Be kind to you these next few weeks. I wish you the best!

PS: If you're ever tempted to go back, remember what he did that night in the car. This is what you get. And if he changes for real, he won't try to get you back because he will know it would be entitled as hell to even try.",3

20018,t3fndo,ItsyBitsyStumblebum,"Something I didn't figure out until my 30s was that I ended up in an abusive relationship because I thought I had a ""normal"" childhood but didn't. Unhealthy habits in our caregivers when we're children lead us to accepting similar unhealthy habits in our adult relationships becausewe consider it ""normal/acceptable"". Don't fall for this! Unsolicited advice from (a) Mom: I highly recommend looking at attachment theory and how it affects us in childhood through to adulthood. Seek out people who have a ( at least mostly) secure attachment style and look for examples of longterm couples who are actually healthy communicators...open and honest and vulnerable. Research how to create and defend healthy boundaries and practice, practice, practice!! If you can, get a good therapist that you like and trust, and ask them to help you find good resources too. 

All that aside, I'm so proud of you! So so many people fall for the cycle of abuse, the promises to change, the emotional manipulation of yelling and tears... You didn't! You stood strong in your convictions and I know you'll be happier longterm because of it. It'd okay to mourn the loss, but keep in mind many times we're not sad because we lost what we had but what we thought we had. You thought you had picked a good, living partner, but when you broke up you *actually* lost a manipulative abuser and the **hope** that your partner was the one. Losing hope is always painful.

But you're actively doing the work to break that cycle for yourself, any kids you might have, and for those around you... I wish I could give you a big hug and let you fall apart on my shoulder. You did so well! You deserve a rest before you tackle the world again. I'm so proud. ❤",2

You walked home in the middle of the night like an absolute boss and instead of dwelling or excusing his behavior, you reached out. You asked for support and you were able to listen to the advice and trust yourself. That takes courage. 
Lastly, make sure you practice self care. Remember to feel love for yourself and for your mind. This will be important for grounding yourself. You need to take time to think about yourself and your wants and needs now.",2
20035,t3fndo,Noctuella,"> Growing up my parents would fight a lot. My dad did a lot worse than   
what my boyfriend did but my mom still stayed with him because she loves  
 him. 

You know, people sometimes use the word ""love"" to mean something very different from what I understand it to mean.

So your dad did what he did, and your mom did what she did, and you grew up thinking that was how relationships were supposed to work.  Your ex-boyfriend might have the exact same history, and you standing up for yourself may have been the first time anyone ever informed him that ""love"" usually means that you don't hurt the other person on purpose.  (News flash!)  And this:

>I told him that he he should get help and learn to control his anger so that he won't treat his next girlfriend like this. 

was PERFECT.  

I'm so proud of you for having the courage to protect your physical and emotional health by breaking up with him.  And I am in awe that you were strong enough to give him an opportunity to learn something, or at least realize that there are such things to be learned, at a time when you yourself were in pain and it would have been easier to just hang up.  On behalf of every person he ever has a relationship with in future, I thank you.  But please do not volunteer to be one of them!  You deserve so much more.

20143,w6ef87,delilahdread,"Can I add to this? Because this is SO good! 

Let’s talk cycle length. 28 days is average just like Mom said, but your cycle can be as long as 40 days or as short as 21 days and still be totally normal! 

Your period can vary in length too! Anything between 2-7 days is totally normal. Most people with uteruses lose between 3-5 tablespoons of blood. Some people have super heavy periods and some people have super light periods. If your period lasts longer than 7 days or you’re needing to change your pad/tampon more than once an hour (even if it’s only for a day or 2) then you should definitely talk to your doctor! You may have “menorrhagia” and there’s things they can do to help. 

On the topic of cervical mucus or discharge, some people only have a little and some people have a lot! That’s normal too, if you’re itchy, smell foul (think fishy or generally really bad), or your discharge is weird colors, your vagina needs a check up and it’s absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about! 

Speaking of color, cervical mucus can range in color! It can be thin and watery, like egg whites, or creamy. It can range from white to light yellow and that’s normal! 

Did you know your cervical mucus can be acidic and bleach your panties? Guess what? That’s normal too! 

It’s okay for you to have a smell down there! It’s completely normal. Your diet, how much water you drink, what medicines you take, where you are in your cycle, health conditions, and more can affect your smell. Coppery, creamy, musky? *Normal!*

If something does not feel right about your period, speak to a OBGYN or primary care doctor about it.

If a doctor is dismissive of your symptoms, refuses to do any investigation or makes you feel you feel uncomfortable, find someone else.

Menstruation can be uncomfortable and hard to deal with but it shouldn't be interfere with your life in a severe way.  It is possible for you to have PCOS, fibroids/tumors, hormone issues or other problems with the system down there.

Heavy flow (changing thickest pad every hour), passing out, cramps/low back pain that hinder movement, migraines, severe nausea, clots passed are larger than a quarter/large coin, duration longer than 7 days or extreme mood swings are abnormal symptoms that should be addressed with a doctor.

Just here to add a little for those of us who do not have normal periods: abnormal periods are sooo common! 

As many have said, your cycle will be unique to you, but if something seems off, talk to a doc!

I started my first period at 13 years old and it was normal for the next four years. At 17, my period stopped. Just poof, gone. For an entire year. 

I talked with my doc and she diagnosed Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. I went on an oral birth control to regulate my hormones and bring my period back. 

I’ve been taking birth control for my periods for 17 years without major incident. My periods are completely different than they were pre-birth control.

Endometriosis. Look into it. Every single person with a menstrual cycle should - I personally believe it's a lot more common than we know of.

Endometriosis at base definition is the presence of endometrial-like tissue OUTSIDE of the uterus.

It feeds off of estrogen and can produce its own. Any adhesions have their own 'mini periods' during your period as well.

Pay attention to your headaches! Do they affect your vision at all? Does one eye get blurry, or feel like there’s a film on it? That’s a migraine with an aura. Tell your doctor about it.

I had my first period when I was 13 and ever since then it has always been irregular. Like I would either get my period earlier than expected or later than expected. This month my period actually came two weeks late which freaked me out because I recently became sexually active and I have a huge fear of becoming pregnant even though we always use protection.

They happen. They feel strange, you'll never get used to them.

Large clots or frequent clots can be indicative of a condition endometrial hypoplasia (which is the medical term for an extra juicy uterus), it means the lining is very thick, generally because you're not ovulating and it is taking longer for your lining to shed.

Clots will have more with irregular cycles.

They vary in size from, don't notice, to regulation american football (I'm only slightly joking). 

Just breathe, let them pass, then go to the toilet. Wait until they stop since sometimes you'll get more than one, and it's more comfortable to wait then go.

If you EVER feel like the doc isn't listening to you or isn't explaining things in a way you understand, please speak up for yourself! The doc may have the credentials, but YOU live in your body and know how it feels and what it does. Be honest with your doc about your symptoms and questions (bring notes if needed!) and don't ever feel ashamed of asking questions. Your health and safety is the most important thing. 

There's nothing scarier or more infuriating than a doc dismissing your fears or minimizing your concerns. If they do, start to find another doctor immediately. (Ask us if you need help searching - most of us mamas have had to find new doctors at one time or another.) 

I had a doctor (briefly) who dismissed my chronic vulvar pain, saying that sex often ""just hurts"" and it's a fact of life. Actual quote from this doctor: ""maybe try a glass of wine before sex?""

I have vulvar vestibulitis, which is a legitimate condition that a legitimate doctor was able to diagnose immediately, without making me feel like a whining hypochondriac.)

Alternatives to pads, tampons and cups are period panties - disposable and nondisposable.  

I tried the disposable for the 1st time and it wasn't my first choice but it wasn't horrible. They were better than pads for heavy days as the absorbent area went all the way up the front and back. 

Reusable panties I love them as main and back up. I always get the highest absorbency. On days when I'm heaviest - bleeding through a regular pad in about 2 hours I have to be home to use it on its own. Otherwise I pair it with a pad to prevent leaks.

A lot of times, these events bother you when you're not on your period, but it's not worth the frustration to try to get the other person to understand.  

Example: A partner who consistently misses the laundry basket goes from, 'grr' and picking it up yourself, to, ""WHAT the FUCK? Are you FIVE? Pick up your damn laundry!!1!"" ""Hur hur, what are you, on the rag?"" *Sounds of unimaginably violence.*

So I've been telling the men i come in contact with that, usually when they mention anything period. It usually goes like, ""Why, yes! I am on my monthly cycle. You should be very careful. The biological construct that gives me the bullshit protection to put up with poor behavior during the rest of the month is gone.""

(Oh, and a tangent? You're not weird for bleaching black underwear. Vaginal discharge is naturally acidic, so it does make those light stains on dark underwear over time.

Went to the doctor who told me it was fine and to wait a little longer. 

It came back on the day I handed in my final project for uni and felt less stressed. 

Periods can get weird or go away if you change your lifestyle, like more exercise or new foods, if you're stressed, or even when you have sex for the first time / have more sex or less sex than usual.

Let’s talk cramps! Unfortunately during your period some cramping is normal. However, your cramping should never be so bad that it interferes with your daily life, if this is the case you should talk to your GYN. 

Cramps can happen a few days before the start of your period, and around ovulation as well (I know, owning a uterus is not always fun) 

Things you can do to help your cramps;
- Hot water bottle
- A nice PMS tea
- Exercise or yoga (it sounds counterintuitive but it works)
- anti-inflammatory medication (Advil/Midol)
- REST!!",137

20295,w6ef87,blueblaez,Come join us over at r/PMDD,6
20296,w6ef87,GreatWentGin,"I was scrolling to find the comment about PMDD. I suffered from it until earlier this year. 

I had two weeks of actual hell - severe depression, anxiety, misphonia (less tolerant of sounds), fatigue, cramps that felt like contractions, insane irritability, etc. for two full weeks of every month.

My male gyno brushed me off multiple times (I’m not going back to him). Finally my PCP suggested I take another try at birth control pills. I was wary because before I had my son, I was on the pill for years and it caused horrible migraines. 

But I had to try something, 14 days of this misery every month was ruining my life. 

It started to work within 2 months, my symptoms were less severe and only lasted about a week. Basically what I would call a severe PMS. 

I was getting headaches for 4-5 days during the week after my period, so I suggested to my PCP that I take the pill continuously (go right into the next pack instead of having the sugar pill week) so that I didn’t get my period, therefore, hopefully stopping the headaches. 

I’m now down to one headache a month and while I can’t track it the same way since I have no period to use for timing, I have about 3-4 days where I feel “off”, but nothing even remotely close to PMDD, I’d even say maybe very mild PMS.

I know the pill doesn’t work for everyone, but my point is DO NOT LET YOUR DOCTORS BRUSH YOU OFF! Keep pushing until you find something that works.

If you’re experiencing severe symptoms leading up to your period, don’t accept that it’s normal. Keep trying! 

For some people a low dose antidepressant works, taken only during/around ovulation/PMDD. 

I’d also like to add that stress can certainly make PMDD worse, I was in an abusive situation for several years and it was the worst my PMDD ever got. After I had him removed from my home, the symptoms weren’t as severe.

Never accept misery and pain as your “normal”.",6
20297,w6ef87,delilahdread,"Auntie checking in! It really just depends! Some people get their cycle back right away and some women take a few months. That’s why it’s *super* important to find a contraceptive that works for you and use it consistently if you don’t want to get pregnant again right away. 

The pill and breast feeding can definitely affect when you get your cycle back. The pill may cause it to start sooner, usually when you get to the placebo pills at the end of the pack. And breast feeding can keep your period from coming back for months! Some people don’t get their period back until they wean their littles, that happened to me with my 2nd and 3rd kiddos. I didn’t have a period for over a year with both of them. That being said, nursing isn’t a reliable form of contraception because while it can prevent ovulation, you still could! 

A few things you didn’t ask about but I wish someone had told me about the postpartum period and postpartum bleeding: 

It can be *really* really heavy, they give you those diaper looking pads for a reason. Pick up some Depends to sleep in, I promise you’ll thank me later. Lol. 

Postpartum bleeding can also last for a long while. I bled for nearly 2 months after my 3rd was born, it can also be surprisingly short. With my youngest I only bled for about a week! You might also pass some pretty big clots and that’s okay. Gross, but okay. Anything bigger than a plum you should call your doctor about. 

If you plan to breastfeed, nursing immediately after birth can slow bleeding. It can also make you *really* crampy for a few days, holding a pillow over your stomach while you nurse can help. 

You’ve got this! Congrats on the new squish in advance! <3",35

The other ladies are right that it's a toss up when you start menstruating again,  but it had a lot to do with breastfeeding.  The longer you ebf the longer you'll go without a cycle. It can come back while bf, but nursing helps keep it away.

20301,w6ef87,Newmoonpie,"Fellow mom here. All the others who responded are spot on (ha)... it all varies depending on your body. A side note, though: Please pay attention to your thoughts and moods for *several* months after you deliver. Once that baby's external, you'll still be full of all the hormones you needed to grow it in the first place. Postpartum depression is no joke (and if you're already being treated for depression or anxiety, you might be predisposed to it, as I was). Tell someone if you feel... helpless? Hopeless? It was a depression I'd never felt before. I sat for hours, rocking the baby and sobbing, feeling totally lost. It happened to me after both of my kids.

Make sure your partner, or your mom or sister or BFF knows you're hurting, and talk to your doc or midwife or therapist or *somebody* ASAP... there's help out there, so keep an eye on yourself, and ask for help if you need anything. You can't be there for your baby if you're in pieces.

It’s worth seeing a doctor to figure out what’s going on earlier rather than later if you can. Those cramps do seem worse than ‘normal’ and would also be worth mentioning. There’s medication that’s more effective than tylenol, but it’s also good to know WHY you’re getting such painful cramps. There’s definitely things that can be done about both irregular and painful periods.",7
20317,w6ef87,Goofpuff,"Make sure you use double protection especially with irregular periods (condom + birth control).

Its normal for periods sometimes be super painful and sometimes just fine.  If it starts always being super painful please see your obgyn to make sure nothing is wrong.",3
20318,w6ef87,browneyedgirlpie,"Hi! I'm older and done with my periods. But I wanted to chime I and say the only regular thing about my periods were how irregular they were. A few years after I started menstruating I went on the pill and that helped make them regular. I'm not familiar with all the new options so there might be something better to try. But the pill was the only thing that kept me regular. Any time I went off of it, within a month or two it was all over the place again. Regularly irregular is normal for some people. But good to check in with a Dr to make sure it's just your normal. 

My cramps made me pass out when I was a teenager, and kept me in bed as an adult. Unfortunately those were normal for me. Using the pill cut the duration of my cramps but not the severity. I eventually moved to a pill where I only had a period 4 times a year. Then my family planned things around those days bc we knew I'd be miserable and in bed. But you do need to visit a Dr to make sure there isn't an issue or something they can help aliveate. 

Since I'm ancient I've had a lot of gyn drs over my lifetime. I have no issues with a male doctor, but if I was feeling anxious or nervous, seeing a male doctor knocked that up a level. There will be female Dr's who aren't compassionate, but I was always most comfortable with a female Dr. You can ask to speak with them and discuss your concerns before setting up an appointment. It's a very personal thing to find a Dr you trust. Don't hesitate to leave messages asking to speak to a few different ones before choosing. Sometimes a recommendation from a friend is helpful. And always discuss your concerns. Explain its your first time and you are feeling nervous about it. It's never fun, but it shouldn't  be so scary that it makes you avoid it. I'd start with asking someone that you trust, in your area for a Dr recommendation. It doesn't have to be someone your age.",2

A good doctor/GYN will be more than happy to talk through something you're not sure about and either look into it or put your mind at ease. 

Where I used to live, I had a family doctor and a GYN. I once noticed a bump in my breast in the shower. I was in my mid 20s, and I mildly panicked because that is drilled into minds - lumps need to be seen ASAP. 

My family doctor dismissed it over the phone. Told me to call the GYN because it might have to do with my IUD. I still don't comprehend that. I called the GYN though - they fit me in that afternoon. The doc talked me through it totally calmly, said I had done the right thing in asking, ultimately determined it was ok. (Likely an angry lymph node.) 

I didn't advocate for myself well then. Now if my family doc blew me off like that, I would immediately be looking for a new practioner.

If you have the levels of estrogen and progesterone you’re ideally supposed to have, you can track your daily temperature immediately upon waking and see a minimum 0.2 degree rise in temperature that is sustained during your entire luteal phase.  If your cervix is where you can reach it, you can confirm that it has changed shape to become high, firm and closed.

3 full days post ovulation (IF you can definitively know you ovulated) with 3 days is sustained higher temps, sustained high/closed/firm cervix, and no cervical mucous, you are outside of your fertility window.

It’s my snooze alarm activity.  (2) I look at the toilet paper every morning and track what I see.  (3) I examine my cervix daily from the day my period ends until at least 3 days after ovulation to confirm ovulation.

Bottom line: it’s not low maintenance and it’s not fool proof.  If I were not completely prepare to have unexpected pregnancy, I would not rely on it.

I get so anxious when I see people say that their app tells me they’re not going to ovulate for another X days but they’re not tracking symptoms.  Those apps assume your luteal phase is 14 days so they average the length of your cycle and subtract 14 days.  They are NOT accurate.

Your body can get aroused even if you are not! 
With physical stimuli your body is going to respond physically. if something bad has happened to you sexually, and you got wet or even got an orgasm, that doesn’t mean you wanted to have sex!

If someone tickles you on your nose with a feather against your will and you sneeze, it doesn’t mean your will doesn’t matter anymore. It doesn’t make it less serious or somehow your fault. It means that somebody did something against your will and your body got an physical reaction to a certain type of physical stimuli.

20392,w6ef87,DianeJudith,"I want to emphasize that while period crams are normal, it doesn't mean it's something you ""just need to get used to"". It's perfectly fine to take painkillers if you need, it's perfectly fine to ask your doctor for something stronger if basic stuff doesn't work, it's perfectly fine to ask for a method of contraception that will help with the pain or even stop your periods whatsoever, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You *do not* need to suffer every month. 

Also, it's actually ok to take the painkillers *before* you start cramping, when you know you're on your period and you usually get cramps. Don't feel guilty for taking pain meds. 

If your pain is unbearable, you can go to ER and they should give you an IV with something stronger. And if your pain is that bad, get checked by a gynecologist. You might have some underlying issues that require treatment.

I've always had painful periods. Hormonal BC helped, but I didn't want to spend the money when I don't need BC. Injection BC stopped my period and it was amazing, but I started putting on weight so I stopped getting them. For me, the best thing is ketoprofen (painkiller), and drotaverine (stops muscle spasms) combo. I can see now that they're not available everywhere (I live in Central Europe), but I recommend to try them if they're available where you live. 

Other things that help is heat (like a hot water bottle on your abdomen, but not too hot!), and standing upright! Apparently the cramps get worse when you're lying down because the uterus has to work harder against the gravity (although it's anecdotal and I'm not sure if true for everyone).

Again, **you don't need to suffer through the pain**.

I got an IUD after I had a kid, and it's been pretty good.

Here’s a prescription for Naproxen and get a hot water bottle.” Naproxen wasn’t available over the counter yet at the time. 

Switched drs to a female dr who thought his choice of birth control pill was weird bc the hormones in it don’t usually help with strong periods, and tried like 6 different ones until we found what worked. If I had even a hint of a side effect she switched me immediately. 

Then I moved and had to get a new dr and he questioned why I was on birth control so young when I said I wasn’t sexually active during my history. I was 18 by then abd had been on it for a few years, and I don’t think 18 is exactly young for birth control. When I said it was for period pain he said I will mess up my body and instead have me a prescription for a very strong painkiller. I didn’t really know any better, but it concerned my mom when I told her, and she helped me find a new dr that put me back on the pill that had been working.

Mine ended up being quite serious, menorrhagia and endometriosis don't mix well! It turns out that those things ran in my family and no one thought it was important to tell me until I was hospitalised for the fourth time! 
Normal birth control didn't work and in the end I was begging them to just rip everything out, but the docs were horrible about it! I ended up getting recommended something called a mirena coil which... Didn't do much. So I changed doctor because I was at the end of my tethers. Being 28 as i am now, noone wanted to help much because 'what if your husband wants children?' (this was ongoing since I was 18!)

And she was amazing. Within two years (covod happened and another doctor tried to intervene) od had a procedure called an Ablation done, with a new coil fitted after too. 

I've not had a period since as that ablation removes all the extra lining and the coils hormones FINALLY stopped the growth of extra lining too. 

It was scary because every single person except one doctor and the surgeon was determined to scare me away (even when I was hospitalised, I had this horrid last doctor who tried to tell me an ablation would make it worse, was only temporary blah blah, it's NOT! ) and I only managed it with those two.

20417,w6ef87,BallroomblitzOH,"((Hugs)) friend. For a couple of years mine went from a steady 28 day cycle to between 21-24 days. This was still manageable. My doc described it as my body trying to use all the eggs as quickly as possible. Then I went 10 months with nothing. SO CLOSE ( has to be 12 months to be considered fully in menopause).  In month 10 I started again and had it for 4 weeks, mostly super light.  Then 2 weeks off, now I am on week 6.  Yes I’ve spoken with my doc. Really hope this is the last gasp.  

Once you hit menopause for real, if you get any bleeding, see your doc immediately. Apparently that is a cancer symptom.

I was looking for this and glad someone mentioned it. I thought something was EXTREMELY wrong with me or that I was bipolar until I learned about PMDD and ways to manage it. 

For those unfamiliar, PMDD is extreme mood swings (usually) the week before your period. I describe it as PMS on steroids. For me, I essentially feel like a different person that's depressed and has zero confidence when the rest of the month I'm a pretty upbeat and possibly excessively confident person. During my teenage years, I wanted to not be alive anymore the week before my period started. I also get pretty extreme rage over things that normally wouldn't bother me.

I also had very irregular periods from what I now know is PCOS, but this meant I would get surprise stains all the time because I didn't know it was coming.

Well apparently me not having x underwear to match x days turned into the oldest host daughter telling others how I was unclean and not changing everyday.

Have you had a sudden weight loss/gain? Have you had blood work done to rule out anemia? There are things that cause weight changes and anemia that are pretty serious and need to be addressed, so if any weight fluctuation wasn't intentional, it's a pretty important symptom. 

Tbh you should have a full set of labs done and see a gyno. Rule out other things before you move on to vaccine injury. If that's not possible, start a multi vitamin and be sure you're getting the proper nutrition/calories.

My host family was based in germany. I worry about the children bc the mom literally beat the kids, and openly expressed how she wanted more. 16 to be precise. They had 6 at the time. The older ones tugged at my heart strings (oldest was 12)

I wish i had a way to report them. The oldest would be around 22.

One of the advantages of the hormone based contraceptive coil is that it doesn't effect me in the same way the implant, shot, or pill would. The hormones stay in the tissue around the coil and don't travel so you won't be effected but are still 99% covered. 

Couple of things to note for contraceptive coil:

1) you can't use tampons anymore as this might rip your coil out.    

2) there is a high chance your periods will stop, that is normal.      

3) during implantation, eat some chocolate beforehand, have some for after, take a good dose of painkillers an hour before the appointment, bring heat pads and wear your comfy clothes. Nothing too tight on your tummy!",1

20555,w6ef87,Nyghtslave,"Technically, yes. But I think they mean to say that, with birth control, there's no dead egg or thickened mucus to get rid of (which is why it can also help people with endometriosis). So when you get to your placebo or pill free week, all that's causing the bleeding is the drop in hormones. Your body still goes through the motions, despite not really having anything to expel. That's also why periods are lighter on birth control, and why it's perfectly safe to skip your ""period"" on the pill.

I’ve been tracking my cycles for 21 years (I’m prone to blood clots and an oops pregnancy wouldn’t be a problem, so I don’t mind relying on natural family planning), so I KNOW when I ovulate.  What happens is I will go through the whole follicular phase with all the symptoms, but no ovulation and no sustained post ovulation temperature shift.  And then I will go through the follicular phase again with no ovulation and no sustained temperature shift.

So that that tells me is that my estrogen levels are no longer high enough to truly trigger ovulation, but they haven’t given up trying either.  My ovaries have a faulty starter 😆

20732,v6hrie,pumalegal,"Wow moms (and sibs too!).  Thank you all so much. I can’t believe the attention this got. You’ve all been so sweet; I didn’t realize how much I needed some of that compassion and validation. 

I was working my way through a breakdown but with the help of my therapist I was managing day to day, but then I caught the rona in early January. I’ve been dealing with long-haul ever since. I’ve never been so exhausted in all my life, even with fibromyalgia and depression contributing to constant fatigue. 

The first two months after I got sick I pretty much just ordered delivery. Then I was able to stock the freezer with nuggets and fries and fish sticks, stuff I could just throw in the oven on a baking sheet. Recently I’ve been able to put something simple on the stove like a pot of pasta and then just dump some shredded cheese on it. But last night was the first time I could gather the mental energy to cook multiple things, and the physical energy to stand at the stove and pull it off. I’ve been beating myself up about how little I can do instead of focusing on the improvements, so thank you, thank you so much for reminding me ❤️",1
20733,v6hrie,EmRaff7,"This looks incredible sib!

Check out r/covidlonghaulers and r/cfs (i have ME/CFS and it is very similar to long covid) if you haven’t already too, they have a lot of resources and information !",1

Even now I have family who are enjoying at my expense that I am worthless idler etc and looking down at me.

Also, don’t kill yourself for these people. I don’t know who you work for, but any increase in responsibility should come with an increase in compensation. Keep healthy balance in your life. Work at a pace that’s comfortable. And if they give you shit, give your two weeks and walk away. You first, always. 

Remember how much we love you on your hard days. The world can be full of dicks, but your chosen family has got you. You’re worth more than you realize.",1

20981,v6yolw,Brain_Booger,"I really don't want to scare you but a lesson I had to learn and wished somebody told me was:

Don't give too much information about yourself to your co-workers or boss. Be vague. It's possible at some point somebody will hold information you give them against you.

That said, I Wish aaaallllllll the best and enjoy your first day. Much love my dear. You'll rock it! 😊",103
20982,v6yolw,st_rdt,"What u/Brain_Booger said ...

>Don't give too much information about yourself to your co-workers or boss. Be vague. It's possible at some point somebody will hold information you give them against you.

People can be real shitty so this advice is gold !

To state the obvious : Be friendly, but don't exhaust yourself trying to ""make"" friends. Sharing TMI or sacrificing time/energy/money to gain someone's friendship isn't worth it.

Just give yourself time ..... when you are several weeks/months into the job, you will instinctively find like minded folks among your coworkers. These are your friends.

Good luck kiddo !",13
20983,v6yolw,lookingforkindness,"Of course. That’s what moms do. And my first job interview was super awkward too. I was so nervous I sweat through my jacket! I’m proud of you, honey!",1
20984,v6yolw,Hamptons2000,message me!!!,1
20985,v6yolw,kamomil,"This is amazing advice! No one needs to know your personal stuff. I overshared when I was younger. Don't be like me lol

My co-workers typically talked about: weather, and what movies or TV shows they watched. Those are the safest topinc",56
20986,v6yolw,Sufficient-Nobody-72,"Best way to keep a coversation and good job environment is to talk about meaningless stuff and avoid any personal/controversial topics unless it becomes a need (like discrimination, harassment, medical needs or exemptions, etc.) And when it becomes a need, the only one who might need to know is HR or in a small business your employer.",13
20987,v6yolw,ettufruite,"Seriously EXCELLENT advice - not just at work, but life in general. Unless it’s friends, family, trusted associates don’t share much of anything with acquaintances. It’s an underrated skill.",7
20988,v6yolw,twir1s,"This over and over again.

I have never regretted holding personal information back from my coworkers. My only regrets ever came from giving too much of my self away.",1
20989,v6yolw,Brain_Booger,Thank you for clarifying some things even further. English is not my mother tongue.,6
20990,v6yolw,Brain_Booger,"Yep. There are Tons of topics you can talk about. Sports, advice where to eat/what's the best kebap in town, weather and movies like you said. And even then, be superficial. Don't be too invested in sports, don't talk about allergies, don't tell in which theater you go. And if they ask you specific questions you can always lie.

Like you, I overshared. Not once but TWICE until I learned my lesson 🤣",20
20991,v6yolw,EwokOffTheClock,"Damn, only took you twice? I had a chip on my shoulder, that if someone didn't know and accept *all of me*, then they couldn't like me. Made for a very lonely young adulthood.",13

I take an SSRI and work in the heat all day. When it gets into the upper 80's and 90's, I need to drink about a gallon a day!

I find it's really helpful to drink a hydration drink instead of water. The one I use is Liquid IV. It has a blend of sugar and electrolytes that comes closer to replacing what you sweat out. It's pretty much identical to pedialyte, but cheaper and tastes better. 

Not totally necessary when you need an extra glass or two of water, but I need it to keep my electrolytes balanced. If I drink plain water, I still get woozy in the afternoon. When I drink hydration drink, I can drink as much liquid as I need (4-6 quarts sometimes during a 10 hour workday) and I'm still thinking clearly at the end of the day!",112

21069,w5rlps,Pascalle112,"u/Miss_squid_tickler my sincerest thank you, from the bottom of my (as I now know) overheated heart.                

Thank you for posting this, and for providing me and others very valuable information.           

I have no gold or awards to give you, all I can say is thank you! 

WHAT THE ACTUAL F’ING F???          

I take the maximum approved dose for one of those.      
I’ve taken it for 5+ years!!! 

I have frequently advised my doctors that I feel hot all the time, others will be completely dressed for cold weather yet I need nothing more than a light t-shirt and a pair of shorts, I can drink water all day - as much as as I physically can and my skin will still react as if I’m dehydrated.            

Yet NONE of them have ever mentioned these side effects! NONE! Never!!!         

I also live in a place where it’s hot, humid, and sunny for 9 months of the year!!!          

How was I never told these were the side effects???         

Why isn’t the risk of overheating on the pamphlet in the box or on the website?!?      

It is all over medical sites, but only if I search for the specific information of “x drug overheating risk”.      

Those sites have references to studies, list the doctors names, all info a person like me can verify.",35
21070,w5rlps,Garrusismyspacebf,Thank you so much for this reminder. I’m overweight and on an antidepressant so it’s extra hot 😭😭,23

21073,w5rlps,Ryugi,"Some non-ssri medication can also raise risk of heat stroke.

If I pour ice cold water on my head, it feels warmer than the air by the time it reaches my thighs.

I'm on 2 meds - a non-ssri anxiety med and a thyroid med - which make me run hot. It hasn't been below 90f in a month and my house doesn't have central air. I've been secluded into a room with a window mount and a fan, other than going to the bathroom to just spray myself, clothes and all, with cold water. It's not worth undressing because it'll dry off within minutes anyway.

But my hands and feet are still cold to the touch somehow?",11

Thanks Mum! Love you many.",6
21078,w5rlps,bete0noire,"This! 

My life changed when I started my SNRI. I got such hot flashes and sweat much more. Being hot triggers nausea (I also struggle with nausea daily). The combo of heat+nausea leads to anxiety attacks. And I'm always battling dehydration. 

It's something I was never warned about, yet impacts me daily even a decade after starting said medication. Others who have never experience this education side effect often think I'm exaggerating how awful it feels, or how it can leave you unable to do the simplest things like taking a walk in nice weather. But those that I know who have experienced it are always super empathetic. 

The best recent-ish purchase of mine was one of those little wear-around-your-neck fans. I also ha e a little rechargeable fan that flips open like a little old cellphone that can sit on the table if I'm sitting outdoors. I'm still on the hunt for a water bottle that truly keeps water cool for a long time.",6

21211,y48r4y,closingbelle,"Wear the dress. It's just a piece of fabric that you've assigned meaning. That's wonderful and beautiful, but there's no reason you can't assign additional meaning, like honoring her memory by wearing it to a family function.

21212,y48r4y,Early-Light-864,"Like PP said, it's just fabric, but I understand that it's more than that to you. 

Wear it so it's like your daughter is there with you. 

Wear it fashionably so that she'd thumbs up your outfit. 

Wear it so that you can proudly say to yourself that you survived the worst imaginable thing, and you're whole and well enough to celebrate a loved one on a special day. 

I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope the wedding is wonderful.",513
21213,y48r4y,TimboBimboTheCat,Wear it. It's like she's joining you in some small way.,153
21214,y48r4y,Significant-Spite-72,"I'm so sorry about your daughter 😪❤️ 

I think the only consideration is how you feel wearing it.

 If, when you wear it, you feel sadder, or more grief, don't wear it. A wedding is a time of new beginnings, and should be a happy occasion 

If you feel ok with it on, then by all means wear it. 

I wore my favourite black dress to my mum's funeral a decade ago. I've worn it many times before and since. It doesn't remind me of her funeral, so I'm happy to wear it. It's just a dress. 

Whatever you decide,  I'm sending you fellow mum hugs if you'll accept them. Please chose what's right for you ❤️",95

21225,y48r4y,Crystal_Dawn,"I think because of the emotional connection, that not only is the dress needing to be worn, but also you'll carry her memory extra close to you while wearing it, and that's extra special.

That being said, if you think there is a possibility that *you* might unexpectedly be triggered while wearing the dress...

 Maybe save it for a different event to test out.

Not at all to make this about me, just thinking about if she was my daughter I might randomly get very emotional over the dress and where I wore it/why I bought it. I wouldn't want to risk having one of my ""flashbacks to the moment associated with the item"" on someone else's day that is supposed to be their happiest memory.",1

My son died a few months ago (very different circumstances). I wore a nice outfit that I already owned because I couldn't face the thought of buying anything at the time (I struggle with buying clothes at the best of times!!) It's been a struggle to wear the outfit since but I've made myself do it a couple of times because I don't want it to forever be That Outfit, you know?

I hope you enjoy the wedding.",11

Whatever you do, it's about yourself and your journey and no one's business but your own. I think the only person you might consider might be what would have been your daughters opinion? But even then, know that grieving is personal and not always rational.",120

I’be been in your girlfriend’s place before, hearing about a traumatic violation of someone I love. If she’s anything like me she was probably worried that she didn’t know what to say to make you feel better, and so grateful that you loved and trusted her enough to tell her. I can pretty much guarantee that she never though you were lying at all, does not think it was your fault at all (no matter the circumstances) and it did NOT change how she sees you, unless it was to realize that you’ve had to be even stronger than she knew. 

If you get a chance, it’ll probably make her feel good if you tell her what her reaction meant to you, and that it was what you needed. Or maybe just show her this post. She might worry she didn’t say the right thing or react the way you needed and this will give her that assurance.",10

I thought my girlfriend wouldn't take me seriously and laugh it off but it actually made her feel sad. I didn't expect her to get affected by it and I felt cared for the first time ever. We never spoke about it after that though. She was just really quiet and told me she needed time to process it.,10

What is there to remember if it was forced? Still, I get asked about my 'first time,' and still it is an open  wound that no amount of work or therapy takes away. I am not sad. I rage.

One year I harvested the lavender from my parents' garden, sewed my own cotton bags from old clothes, printed and laminated (thanks old job stationery cupboard!) little labels.

21607,tq76va,ChiisaiHobbit,"She is simply adorable 😍. I'm glad you finally got your little one. I'm sure you treasure her and will always try to do the best for her.

Remember to be patient and kind, not only to your little miracle, but yourself. Parenting is hard and every kid is unique. You are only human, mistakes will be made and that's ok, as long as you acknowledge it and learn from them. 

I wish you all the best. XOXO",51

Everyone says to take it slow and enjoy the moments, and I have to join the chorus of cliche. Mine are 10 years apart and it’s crazy how much more present I was with the second child.

It’s okay to take a few extra minutes to enjoy where you are and what you’re doing.

My second bit of advice it don’t let the kids come to bed with you at night! You should keep your bedroom your grown-up sanctuary where you can escape if needed; if you do this it will become the only place in the house you can do so. 😅",6

All this is to say, you honor your lost babies by enjoying every moment with the babies you can hug.  Watching my ""rainbow baby"" grow into his adulthood, find a purpose, find a life partner fills my heart with joy.  I'll never forget those that I lost, but my love for those who are here is fierce.",4

Enjoy that little one. Time goes so fast. Hold her as much as you want and love on her as much as you can.",3

21663,tq76va,anonomot,"What a beautiful baby! That smile is pure love! I want to echo what some other moms have said here—being a new mom is not easy, no matter what anyone says. It can be very challenging, physically and emotionally. Be kind to yourself and cut yourself slack for all the “mistakes’ you think you might be making. They’re not mistakes and you’re doing a great job! That smile proves it! Make sure you take some time for yourself—remember, a happy mother makes a happy baby. The look on your daughter’s face brought back such a strong feeling of nostalgia for my son when he was a baby! He’s almost 20 now and doing great. Stay strong a give that baby lots of hugs! You have years of joy ahead of you!",2

21671,tq76va,Amadecasa,"It took me until my older son was 4 1/2 to have my second son.  Try to ignore the insensitive comments, like ""why can't you have another one?"" and ""Why can't you be happy with what you have?""  My kids are adults now, so I imagine the medical help has progressed a lot.   There are many, many, countless families like yours and we all want the best for you.",3

I remembered his birthday wrong for the better part of a year and only remembered when my friend (who gave birth exactly nine months after I did) posted her kid’s birthday and I had a synapse misfire. I’d take a bullet for that kid. I love him more than breathing. Some people are wired wrong for dates. My best friends have been my best friends since we were 14 and I still only remember one’s birthday because it’s on a holiday. I’m not making excuses for your folks, I just want you to know forgetting the date doesn’t necessarily mean forgetting how important and wonderful you are. I hope they’re sufficiently repentant tomorrow but paint the town red tonight.",2

I'm sorry that it hasn't been especially great so far. I've had some crummy birthdays myself. In fact, my own mother only posted on my Facebook (no personal text or call) and I haven't even heard from my dad at all.  Not even on Facebook! But I'm doing ok anyway. It sucks not feeling like your important on the day that you're supposed to feel most important of all.

Birthdays come and go, and you'll have some better ones.  But today you deserve to be celebrated, and that's what I'll do.  I'll celebrate you.  I hope you can find it in yourself to celebrate you too. Treat yourself to something. You deserve it today!

Crazy that we're almost exactly a decade apart (I turn 28 tomorrow). I know it's frustrating when no one remembers, and, since I haven't talked to the folks since I was your age, it hurts even more sometimes. 

But, what's important to remember, is that some people do care! I care that it's your birthday! Also, you should care! Go be kind to yourself in whatever way you can! See a movie, stroll through a park, etc. Whatever makes YOU happy!

If others can't appreciate you for the amazing person you are, remember to appreciate yourself! You're a special person, and you deserve such praise! 

Message me if you need anything! And, once again, Happy Birthday! 

Now, be safe. 
And Go. Have. FUN!",1

21787,ydff8o,BirdCelestial,"Hey, more like Big Sis here than Mom, but happy birthday to you! I had a lot of birthdays like that in my teens. Anyway, I have good news -- you're on the cusp of really *living your life.* You're at an age now where you're soon going to be moving out into the world -- finishing school if you haven't already, making new friends that you really connect with (not just kids who happen to sit next to you in class). You'll start choosing your family and building a circle of people who love and care about you, whether that's at work or university or through a hobby. The whole fuckin' world is out there, just waiting for you.

I know you must feel alone now, but this won't last forever. People who don't know better often told me as a kid that childhood was the happiest time of their life, but that couldn't be more wrong for me, and I'm sure your future holds a lot of happier days, too.",1

And as many have said, remember it is perfectly fine to treat yourself the way that helps you most. In many situations, such as when you are proud of your progress, or how well you handled a situation, and most certainly in more somber situations like this!

Whether it is some nice food, a hobby thing you had been holding out on getting, spending time with your favorite music/tv show, you deserve to treat yourself ❤️",1

21938,ydff8o,gussmith12,"Yes, love!  Happy birthday to you!

Glad you got yourself a treat and had a good time doing it!  

As you get older, folks will forget your birthday from time to time, or simply not do much to celebrate it, so don’t put much in the way of expectations on that.  

It’s one of the harder things about growing up  - others treat us more as adults when sometimes we only want to be hugged or feted or patted on the back.  Take it as a sign that others now see you as more mature, and don’t think you need these things.  Don’t interpret it as “no one cares” - that’s not the right frame.

If the party itself is important to you, then organize one yourself so it happens.  If you just want to celebrate more low-key next year, invite your favourite person (or a random stranger) out for a meal, and make your own celebration.  Buy someone else a treat in honour of another year around the sun!  You have a whole year to answer the question “now that I’m an adult, how do I want to celebrate what I’ve accomplished over this past year?”  That’s what a grown-up birthday is all about!",1

21982,ydff8o,desertboots,"I send my sympathies.  It's so hard being forgotten.  As a mom I learned I *had* to advocate for myself and let other people know when I was feeling unappreciated.  You will learn how too! 

Definitely do something nice for yourself today.  Then ask the parents for whatever kind of celebration meal you'd like this weekend.  Be specific.  Call restaurants before the convo to ensure a reservation is available.  Specify that you'd like them to pay. 

Don't get all mopey because it is possible there's a surprise birthday party in there works for you... and it would suck if that's what's happening. 

And then grab their phones and add in your birthday to their calendars so they can't claim to forget again. 

Happy birthday duckie!",1

22089,vufta1,TacticaLuck,"I've had a hard time *actually* cooking for quite a while now.

I've found that a grill is my new best friend. I can make just about anything on it and also without worrying about cleaning various amounts of dishes everyday.

Lots of vegetables and some meat. All mostly finger food.

It has helped me get back in to cooking while leaving me mostly stress free of the ensuing chores.",2
22090,vufta1,MsAmethyst11,Is that salmon?,2
22091,vufta1,fruitjerky,"One of my favorite meals, and the salmon looks perfectly done! Great work!",2

22095,vufta1,Hollixandra,"You did a great job. And just to let you know you’re not alone. And this post made me feel not alone. Whatever obstacles you’ve been dealing with in your life won’t always be there and it shows that you have the strength to overcome it all. This may seem like a simple step but I know it’s a big one. It’s good to get the reassurance that I’m not alone out there to where doing simple tasks seem like so much work. Good job, looks yummy.",1
22096,vufta1,SpiritSongtress,Looooks amazing!,1
22097,vufta1,Character_Log_5444,"Chef mom here, darling- the sear on that salmon is top notch! Excellent job. Bon appetit.",1
22098,vufta1,SmolBeaver,"This looks so delicious and beautiful! You did a good job on it all and i hope you enjoyed every bit of it!

Cooking is hard, my partner and I are trying to get back into the swing of cooking ourselves. We're both suffering from depression and are both just fighting the urge to pick something up. But the feeling we get when we see our plates and the leftovers in our kitchen - it helps us a little.

You're doing good, love. You've made a good decision and your decision will thank you",1
22099,vufta1,itchyspiderbutthole,That looks delicious! Well done!,1
22100,vufta1,sunkissedshay,Looks fantastic. I would love a piece. Good job!🥰,1
22101,vufta1,SirKitGre3d,"So proud of you. Seems like you haven't lost your touch if you haven't cooked in a year. The meat looks perfect, the veggies look delicious. 

Remember always add less salt than you need. You can always add more but never remove it",1
22102,vufta1,BrianMcFluffy,... well now I'm hungry...,1
22103,vufta1,angel14072007,And you went for the healthy food too! Awesome,1

22107,vufta1,SpicySaladd,"It's taken me ten years to get mac'n'cheese right, it's nothing to scoff at 😩",26
22108,vufta1,asdf346,"I cook myself the most basic of foods, usually meat and veg, but the satisfaction of cooking my own meal makes it taste so much better than buying meals",3
22109,vufta1,cr8tor_,Everyone in my house hated salmon until i cooked it properly for them and advised them they did not have to eat the skin.,5
22110,vufta1,steady_damage,"Thank you. ♥️
Had to google what provolone is. Is it good?",11
22111,vufta1,steady_damage,Next I’m thinking about Chili con Carne. Not sure when I can do it.,14
22112,vufta1,steady_damage,Yes it is,1
22113,vufta1,m1thrand1r__,add brie and it feels gourmet as hell 👌,7
22114,vufta1,skbiglia,"I even take the skin off for these people lol. I have stuffed it, I have baked it, I have grilled it, I have poached it, I have broiled it…and so on. They are categorically again any fish that is pink and not fried.",5
22115,vufta1,standard_candles,It's good melted generously on a sandwich.,13
22116,vufta1,leavetaterualone,"No, no it's not

Edit: provolone fucking sucks.",-18
22117,vufta1,KahurangiNZ,"Excellent choice.  And the awesome thing about chili is that you can cook 10+ serves as easily as you can cook 2, so if make it in bulk and freeze the extra portions individually, you can just grab it and reheat whenever you're feeling like something home cooked but just don't have the ability to actually cook.  Plus you can have lots of different meals from the same thing - taco's, chili, loaded fries, etc :-)",3
22118,vufta1,Redhummer,❤️,1
22119,vufta1,MsAmethyst11,I live salmon,1
22120,vufta1,SpicySaladd,Lemme just write that down 🤔,3
22121,vufta1,apoohneicie,It’s good melted on just about everything.🙂,9
22122,vufta1,apoohneicie,The pro-provolone set has spoken.😐,7
22123,vufta1,Togakure_NZ,"Check out the difference between soft bread crumbs, normal bread crumbs, and panko bread crumbs. Pick your choice, a little bit of grated parmesan on top...",2
22124,vufta1,leavetaterualone,You can keep your trash cheese. Its worse than Swiss,-8
22125,vufta1,SpicySaladd,Bread crumbs on mac'n'cheese? Who knew!,1
22126,vufta1,apoohneicie,"I like smoked Gouda the best, but nothing…NOTHING is more disgusting than that bitter piece of plastic they call Swiss cheese!!!",2
22127,vufta1,serialmom1146,Oh it's the best!!,2
22128,vufta1,leavetaterualone,"See, that's how I feel about provolone.",1
22129,vufta1,apoohneicie,Blech. We can just agree to disagree on provolone but agree on the Swiss abomination.,1
22130,vufta1,leavetaterualone,"Nope, now you have to like Swiss or face the wrath of the majority!",1
22131,vufta1,apoohneicie,I will die first!!!,2
22132,vufta1,AlwaysSleepingLolX2,"Swiss is awful, Gouda sucks.",-1
22133,vufta1,apoohneicie,Gouda is manna from heaven and…well yeah Swiss is crap.,0
