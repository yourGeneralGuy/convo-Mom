0,My daughter passed away when she was 15. Today is her 21st birthday and I so miss being a mom to her. Anybody need a mom for a minute?,,shxdas,13138,828,https://i.redd.it/uieiwvhnn8f81.jpg

2,Hey Mom! So I’ve reached a pretty big milestone and have now been transitioning for over a year! I’m so proud at how far I’ve come and I hope you’re proud of your daughter. 💜,"My Mom passed away before I was able to come out to her and it’s something that will always haunt me forever. 

I never wanted anything more than to be Mom and Daughter together, cooking meals, getting our nails done, going shopping, etc and just coming to terms that I’ll never get that chance is difficult.",weu7zn,8962,531,https://i.redd.it/3ux0bpvgref91.jpg

10,MOMMMM!!! I’ve been in a womens shelter for three months and I had to leave so much behind to not set off any alarms. I’ve finally been able to afford a laundry hamper and full body mirror 💙 I’ve never been so grateful so razor refills and a clock. A water bottle! Kitchen towels! They’re so pretty!,"I’m literally dancing around my room opening this haul I’ve finally been able to afford after struggling for so long. It feels so bitter sweet. I have no one to celebrate this with who will understand why this is such a big amazing moment for me 💚💚💚💚

I’m so happy right now to have the basics I’ve been saving for months.

Truthfully there’s no one I can celebrate all these milestones with. I’ve come so since I escaped and I wish I could tell the whole world or have someone say omg I see you! You’re doing it! This is a big deal! Thank you for being that safe space for me moms 💚

Edit: I forgot the other stuff I got! I’m literally happy crying from gratitude! I got a steel 30oz tumblr for the summer. It’s so cute and classy. No more rationing plastic water bottles. I can’t stop staring at it. I’m dancing in front of my mirror with my tumblr like the happiest I’ve been in so long. My clock is so big!! No more racing around looking for a device wondering what time it is while getting ready (I have ADHD so clocks help so much). I got face towels, no more paper towels!! But i got some of those and toilet paper too! I was using one roll of paper towels for both. I got the *comfiest* flip flops that I don’t ever want to take off. I got that lysol spray that smells like lavender 💜 and dryer sheets and febreeze that I keep spraying on everything lol god it feels so good. Body lotion!! And it smells like summer!! And it’s from my favorite vegan brand. I still can’t get over having my trash in an actual trash can and my laundry in an actual hamper that won’t stink. And another small laundry basket to carry my laundry up that won’t take using all my strength to climb the stairs. Can you tell I went to target? Lol thanks for letting me share this, I’ve been dying to tell anyone

Edit 2: OMG A GOLD I LOVE THIS SUBREDDIT 🥺💓

Edit 3: I turned my phone off the night I posted this and woke up to all of this 💓 I’m so overwhelmed I can’t even put it into words. I’m sorry I couldn’t update sooner. My rabbit had a little scare this week and I’ve been high key stressed about getting him better and getting him to take some meds. He’s doing a little better now thankfully. I just didn’t have the social battery or energy to respond or update until now. 

I honestly didn’t think anyone would see this. Maybe one or two people but the out pouring of love I’ve received is one of the most touching moments I’ve experienced on Reddit. To be seen and celebrated with like this, it helps so much on the lonely harder days than you can imagine. 

I want to respond to each and everyone of you, but I might not get to it tonight. I’m so sorry to keep everyone waiting and sorry I couldn’t update sooner. I just want to put my full energy and focus into my replies

To everyone who offered me some help, I can’t tell you the feelings of gratitude and love I had when I saw your messages. The internet can be such a crazy mean place. But all of your messages restore my faith in humanity and give me so much hope for our world. Im overwhelmed and want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindnesses are so heart warming. It’s really kept me going this week. 

I’m going to get back to everyone as soon as I can. Thank you for being so patient and sweet to me. I don’t know if I can post or link my stuff here so I’ll message everyone who offered individually. 

Moms, siblings, friends, fam, i love you all so much. I wish all the blessings on you.

I honestly cannot wait to be in the position where I can scroll through this subreddit and offer kindness and help like you all have done for me 💛 I can’t wait to pay it forward and be a mom for a minute to more people like me who need support and love the most 

You’re all my favorite people in the internet

Edit 4: I’m so sorry, I have ASD and things slip from my mind so quickly. I wanted to say thank you so much for all the awards!!!! I literally dropped my phone when I woke up and saw all of them. Good lord I’ve never received so many golds, let alone awards! I’m going around giving everyone all the rewards I can now lol thank you so much for appreciating and celebrating my little wins and milestones. You’re all so kind, I wish the world was more like you",v7bcp1,4816,213,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/v7bcp1/mommmm_ive_been_in_a_womens_shelter_for_three/

18,I’m sure you’re all tired of my updates but I just need one more happy moment......they chose my middle name.......and the second they told me why I broke down.,"So I accepted my parents offer to legally adopt me. Part of that was I wanted to take their last name, but also due to the abuse from my biological parents I didn’t want to keep my middle name since since it was my biological mothers first name. 

I told my new parents I wanted them to choose a name for my middle name because they have 4 kids between them (3 living) but have none biologically together so they’ve never gotten to choose a name for a child together. I wanted to give them that opportunity as a couple/parents and also for me to have the sentimental value that they chose my new middle name specifically for me.  

So we’re headed to the lawyers soon to start paperwork and they wanted to come up with a name before we started the paperwork. Apparently they were awake half the night searching baby names and meanings on the Internet and discussing it trying to find one they loved. 

Well they found one. 

They chose “EMMELLYN” which means  “peaceful home” 

They told me their reasons for meaning and spelling were: 

1. With them and being adopted I now will legally forever have a peaceful home/family. No more abuse or trauma to worry about. 

2. Both of their middle names start with “E” so they only considered “E” names 

3. Moms middle name has “ELL” in it 

4. Dad’s first name has “ELL” in it 


As soon as they finished that explanation and I said my full name with this middle name and their last name out loud.........instant tears from me. 

I don’t know what I expected them to come up with for a name, but this has so much more meaning and deep ties to them/their names than I ever thought they could pack into one name. 

I finally know my new name.....it’ll take a while for the whole process and before it’s legal and all that, but I finally feel like I’m moving on from my past and building a future with my family.",v45sha,3995,361,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/v45sha/im_sure_youre_all_tired_of_my_updates_but_i_just/

24,My baby sister just spoke for the first time,"She’s 11. She’s my baby cousin technically but my parents have custody and they’re adopting her. 

She didn’t speak at all although I swear I heard her talking to her comfort toy, a stuffed elephant. 

She’s homeschooled and I’m taking online classes so I can take care of her during the day. She spends most of the day sitting next to me/in my lap while I work and we’ve gotten really close. 

She got sick on Monday. Her doctor said it’s just a stomach bug and she’ll be fine but I had to take her to the hospital today. I called my mom at work and she met us there. I picked my sister up and tried to hand her off to my mom and she held onto me and said “no”. That was huge for her. So my mom got her bag and I carried her in and she mumbled “Ellie” (her elephant is named Ellie). 

This is huge for her. This is the first time she’s ever spoken to any of us.

Update: I’m with my sister at the hospital and she’s looking so much better. She also has the energy to play with her toys for the first time since Monday.",waippe,3820,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/waippe/my_baby_sister_just_spoke_for_the_first_time/

29,I really like my foster home so far,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this post but I don’t know where else to put this. 

I’ve been in my foster home for 4 months now and it’s really nice. I have my own room with a really comfy bed and my foster parents let me paint it whatever color I wanted. They even took me shopping for decorations. They have 4 other kids, all girls. We don’t always get along but they’re usually pretty nice, especially the oldest two. They also have a lot of animals. Their house is on a farm. They have 2 horses, 24 chickens, 7 ducks, 2 dogs, and 3 cats. I’m scared of cats but they’re not that bad and I can usually stay away from them. This family takes me on vacations with them. They travel a lot. And there’s always really good food in the house and I can eat whenever I want. My foster mom is the best cook. They let me do school online because I get really scared around a lot of people and I have a really hard time talking in front of people and I’m doing really good. I had a test today and I got a B. My birthday was on Wednesday and they got me presents. I don’t usually get presents on my birthday so I was kinda confused at first but opening the presents was really fun. 

Im really sorry if the post is too long. I’ve never done this before.

37,If you ever need a trip to Canada for poutine…,"In Canada, you can get a poutine in every province, if you so choose. Not everyone wants to order poutine, and that’s totally fine. It’s your choice. 

In the US, some states have restaurants with poutine on the menu. Lots don’t. And after today, fewer will. 

If you find yourself in need of a poutine, but live in a state that restricts access to poutine, consider a trip to Canada, and give me a shout. I won’t ask what size poutine you want or why you haven’t considered other food options. That’s your choice. That is ONLY YOUR CHOICE. I can, however, help take you to order your poutine, wait with you while you eat, and make sure you have a comfy place to rest, post-poutine.

52,hi Mom's. it's me again. I got a 65% salary increase and I cannot tell my family,"Hi Mom's, dad's, brothers and sisters.

If my post history is of any interest,  I come from a toxic,  narcissistic and dysfunctional family.

I've always been the by the way child, albeit first born, yet my brother is the golden child. Culturally,  boys and men are better.

I've always been ambitious, studious and hard working. My brother has always been our mother's pet and anything I ever did was always over shadowed.

I began my current position last year. I am a late in life student, I finished my law degree when I was 36. Am currently doing masters.

Due to rising costs, as well as high performance,  my salary was increased by 50% after tax as of Friday. Indefinitely. I am so grateful for finally earning my worth (I am a non practicing legal practitioner in the financial services industry).

When I began my current role, I only told my parents a portion of what I earned. When I earned a bonus of 2 salaries on top of my salary in April, I just did a grocery run.

With the unexpected bonus (I was working less than a year), I settled all my debt. Including university. I am not in the USA,  so our tertiary fees are not that high.

I have been living debt free since April.

Right now, I've been afforded financial freedom,  through my hard work and persistence. I am grateful for who I have become, irrespective that no one in my immediate family has ever believed in my capabilities.

Thank you Internet family for listening.

Have a blessed week ahead.",wu7dr2,2967,283,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/wu7dr2/hi_moms_its_me_again_i_got_a_65_salary_increase/

59,"I've been clean from heroin for over 10 years, I bumped into an old ""friend"" who tried to convince me to use with him but I still said no.","I'm trying really hard to feel proud. I guess you could say I'm fishing a bit, for validation or something. 

I'm 33 now, I started using heroin when I was about 12 - not by choice at the time and I literally didn't even know what it was, then after a while it *was* by choice. I was in a really bad situation. Now I've been clean since my early 20s and I'm building a life I'm really happy with. 

I very recently bumped into someone I knew back then, we reconnected and he said he was also in recovery. Then we arranged to hang out and he showed up in an absolute state - I walked away and woke up to a load of texts and voicemails trying to get me to go score with him. 

Obviously I didn't do it and I was 100% open and honest with my partner about everything that happened. I blocked him. I'm still clean. I wish I felt proud of it though because tbh I just feel shame for being a junkie in the first place. 

I don't have a mum, dad or sibling. My partner says he's proud but he's also upset and I'm kinda spiralling even though he's being *so* supportive, I feel undeserving I guess. Some support from anonymous parent-figures would be lovely if that's ok.

61,Update Post: I took the leap of faith and accepted their offer to adopt me.,"Update: they’ve chosen my middle name. I made a new post with all the information there. 

So yesterday I posted that my chosen parents had let me know they had a desire to legally adopt me.

I’ve spent the last 24 hours on a roller coaster of emotions, and Reddit helped and hindered that experience for me. Some of you were a huge help and support and some others made me feel I had no choice but to decline. 

Tonight I asked my chosen parents the backstory and if their kids knew, if their kids were accepting of it etc. 

Apparently they reached out to a lawyer on March 1st to see if we met the criteria for adult adoption and once they found out that we would meet the criteria they got more information from their lawyer about the process to make it happen, and decided they wanted to suggest that offer to me.

Then at the beginning of April they told their kids that they wanted to legally adopt me and asked for all of their true opinions on it. Apparently that went over completely fine and everyone agreed it was a good choice because it would protect me if I have got hurt or sick and needed someone to act on my behalf, plus their kids thought maybe it would help me feel more apart of the family. They even showed me the group text messages their kids sent last night and sent this morning asking if I had told them yes or no yet because they’ve been waiting to find out my decision. 

Around 6:45 tonight I sat them down, asked for the backstory and then once I had my questions answered I told them I wanted them to adopt me. I even called them Mom and Dad for the first time (I’ve only ever used their first names). 

Mom broke down immediately and hugged me for a while as she cried. Dad held it together emotionally until I told him I wanted to have his last name. I also told them I didn’t want to keep my bio mother’s name as my middle name. I told them I wanted them to come up with a couple names that they like that I could choose from. I told them since they never had a biological child together (all their kids are from their first marriages) they never got to name a child together so I wanted them to get to have a say in my new middle name, plus for me that will carry sentimental value. Dad said he was never going to tell me he wanted me to take his last name because he wanted it to be 100% my choice but that it means the world that I want his name. 

So I’m spending the night here again tonight because the emotions are running high and I want to be near them for one more night......... but I’M GETTING ADOPTED!!!!",v3lwwp,2807,337,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/v3lwwp/update_post_i_took_the_leap_of_faith_and_accepted/

85,Update on my last post on whether I should break up with my boyfriend because he kicked me out of his car and left me on the side of the road. I broke up with him.,"I made a post a couple days ago on whether or not I should break up with my boyfriend after we had an argument and he kicked me out of the car and left me on the side of the road alone at 11 p.m. I thought that I was overreacting by wanting to break up with him but after reading all the comments on my previous post I realized that I was not. Those comments also mentioned some other red flags just from reading my post that I didn't notice before. I did a lot of reflecting on our relationship after I made that post and read all the comments. I started realizing a lot of things that were wrong with our relationship. I realized that there were lot more red flags. 

I decided to break up with him and I broke up with him yesterday. I was going to do it in person but some of the people in the comments told me not to as it might not be safe. I sent him a long text explaining everything instead. He called me right after he read the message. I answered and he started yelling at me. There was a lot yelling then crying then yelling then crying again. 

He apologized a lot and he told me that he would change. He genuinely sounded like he was sorry for everything and was ready to change. He promised to never hurt me again. At one point I felt guilty for breaking up with him. But I remembered that some of the comments on my last post told me that he would apologize and tell me that he would change then do the same thing again and that it could get worse. 

It was a long conversation and by the end of it he just accepted it. He asked me what he could do and I told him that he should get help and learn to control his anger so that he won't treat his next girlfriend like this. Then I cried for the rest of the night. I know that what he did was wrong and he didn't treat me well but I'm still sad about it. Some of you that commented on my last post were concerned for my safety but I'm okay and I think I'll be fine. 

Thank you to everyone that commented on my last post. Thank you for the advice and support. And thank you to those of you that shared your experiences. Sadly a lot of people has experienced something similar to this. I made that post because I don't have a mom that I can talk to. I have a mom but we're not close and I can't talk to her about these things. I'm glad that I made that post. Growing up my parents would fight a lot.

86,"Ok kiddos, we need to have a birds and bees chat. Everything you should have been told about menstruation but weren’t.","This is not to shame anyone for not knowing what they don’t know.  Knowledge is power and some people don’t care about you having power over your body.  

You can ask as many questions as you like.  There are no stupid questions and I have a looong attention span for answering.

A full menstrual cycle for a person in their fertile adult years lasts an average of 28 days.  That does not mean that YOUR cycle will last 28 days.  Just like you might not be of average height or have average intelligence or average body temperature, there are a lot of variables.  Furthermore, the length of your cycle is going to change over time.

The parts of a menstrual cycle are: (1) menstrual phase (your period), (2) follicular phase (your body getting ready to release an egg), (3) ovulation (your body has released an egg), and (4) luteal phase.

Let’s talk about these parts in more detail.

(1) menstruation.  Day 1 of your menstrual cycle is the first day of your period.  Spotting is not your period, periods can be light but they’re more than spotting.  Periods can last anywhere from just a few days to a week.  If your period lasts longer than a week, mention it to your gynecologist.  It can be nothing or it can be something problematic.  It may also lead to anemia (low iron).

(2) follicular phase.  Your estrogen levels are starting to climb which triggers your ovary to get ready to release an egg and your uterus gets ready to host an embryo. 

The increase in estrogen is also causing you to produce cervical mucous.  When you urinate in the morning, wipe your vulva (front to back) and make sure you swipe inside the outer labia.  Don’t wipe your vulva dry (you’ll irritate it), this is just a gentle swipe.  Take note of what you see.  

If the tissue is just damp with urine, you aren’t producing cervical mucous yet. If it’s the consistency of lotion, estrogen is building but you’re not yet fertile.  When it looks like egg whites (or snot), that means you’re fertile.

Most people produce eggwhite cervical mucous for 3-5 days leading up to ovulation.  If you consistently have only 1-2 days, mention it to your gynecologist.  You could have low estrogen levels or you might just be dehydrated.

Sperm can live for 5-7 days inside your body IF you have eggwhite cervical mucous for them to live in.   This means you can get pregnant from sex you had several days earlier.

(3) ovulation.  The day your ovary releases an egg is ovulation.  Most people’s bodies alternate between the right and left ovary.  Some people feel a sharp pain when their ovary release an egg, kind of like a running stitch.  That’s normal, don’t worry.

Once released, the egg can only survive for 24 hours.  Once that 24 hours ends, your estrogen levels drop, progesterone spikes, your cervix closes and becomes firm, and your cervical mucus gets thick and sticky.  If the egg is fertilized, it’s now in a closed environment.  If it’s not, it dies.

Your body can’t tell yet whether or not your egg is fertilized.

(4) Luteal phase.  This is the phase of your cycle that is the most consistent in length.  Your body might delay ovulation, but once that egg is released, you cant put the genie back in the bottle.

Your temperature will be slightly higher during your luteal phase and progesterone is the dominant hormone.  Approximately 7 days into the luteal phase, a fertilized egg will implant.  Only then can your body start to realize you’re pregnant.  This is why early pregnancy tests can be a false negative.

A luteal phase shorter than 10 days indicates low progesterone and May make it difficult to stay pregnant (low progesterone cannot be relied on as birth control). 

If you have any questions,ask away

Moms- I know this is an odd question, but I have no one else to ask. Almost 10 years ago, my daughter died unexpectedly. I was reeling and bought 2 very expensive dresses for the wake and funeral. She was so fashionable and I didn’t want to embarrass her, so I bought 2 classic and beautiful dresses that have sat in my closet ever since. 
My nephew is getting married tomorrow and I tried on one of the dresses and it’s completely appropriate. Can I wear it? I don’t think it’s disrespectful to her memory, but I’d like some input, if you don’t mind. I doubt anyone will remember. But what if they do? 
I do have a plan b dress.

It’s been really shitty having to keep this whole thing from my bio mom. I’m at the clinic now, and everyone is really nice. I’m just afraid of the pain, because I have to be awake (it’s a suction). They are going to give me a Valium for my anxiety. 

There were religious protesters outside, which I knew would happen. I’m a Christian myself, but I don’t believe the things they say, and I feel like their lack of compassion is a bigger deal to God than my medical procedure. 

I feel like I’m going to throw up, and I can’t stop shaking.

Update 2: I’ve had the ultrasound and spoken to the nurse about my fears. I’m only six weeks so that’s good.
Still scared, but they gave me some anti anxiety medicine, and told me the pain will last five minutes at most. They way they talk about it I feel silly for being scared, but I am regardless.

You are all so kind and wonderful. Thank you for the support you’re funneling in. It’s helping to distract me, and I feel loved. You all are heroes for people like me.

I moved pretty far away after I left him and when his brother called me to tell me, I thought it was a sick joke.  It wasn’t.  He got his car that he was living in repossessed and I guess that was the final straw.

I’m at a loss of what to do.  He ruined everything we had planned for and kept it from me.  He stole from me.  Now I can’t stop crying for him and want nothing more than to goto his funeral, but I can barely afford feed myself.  Not even taking my medication right now.

I also sucked it up and called my oncologist and was able to pick up a months worth of antianxiety meds within an hour. This three week delay also means that the friend I will be staying with long-term with can fly down to Texas and be in the car with me for the three day drive up to DC. I have an extremely hard time advocating for myself, a major part of what led to my divorce, and I want to think you from the bottom of my art for making me realize that I'm not offending people or being rude by asking for help.

First of all, u/Summerpoppies , THANK YOU MOMMA!! If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have checked through all the messages like you suggested. There are also a lot of other mother geese that suggested that it didn't sound like a 14 year olds speech, and mums, you were right. (Note: one such is u/SpookyMiaMonkey for pointing out more things while I was writing this. Thank you so much momma.)

After looking through the messages between us from the past few months, my eyes have been opened to all the lies in his little story. The person behind the account seemed like they were trying a bit TOO hard to match up what kids nowadays like, it became all they ever talked about in the end. (Mostly Starwars, and FNAF) Not only that, but I noticed a few other times when this person had said really rude things about other jokes I made. The person seems like a groomer in the way he talked too, which just makes me Ill to think about. 

I've since then blocked him, and I won't be talking to him anytime soon. 

To every mother goose, sister or brother, my love goes out to you for saving me from a groomer. I can't put it into words how happy and relieved you have made me feel.",xbmuz7,1917,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/xbmuz7/to_all_the_mums_sisters_and_brothers_who_replied/

144,"Mom, I overheard my MIL talking behind my back and I’m crushed","Mom, I wish I could call you and tell you everything about it because I really need some motherly comfort right now. 
Yesterday my 3yo daughter hurt her hand. I didn’t see it happening so it was a bit hard to assess how bad it could be. She cried a lot, saying her “arm turned”, her hand was limp. We decided to take her to the hospital to make sure nothing was broken or dislocated. Because of covid and the ER only allowing one adult per child, I had to stay home while my partner took our daughter to the hospital. 
MIL thought I was away and I heard her giving out angrily about the fact that we were taking our child to the ER, that we were snowflakes, overreacting/dramatic parents and “spoiling her” by giving her so much attention, that it could have waited the next morning, that my child is probably faking it a bit anyway. She was so angry. The whole family agreed. No compassion, no empathy. I don’t understand why someone would be mad about something like this. We didn’t miss any big event, it was the day after Christmas and people were just doing their own things. We are not harming anyone by doing what parents should do : taking your child to see a doctor when they’re hurt/sick. Something I presume she rarely did with her own kids because she always talks about how her “infants got the whooping cough once and she never took them to see the doctor because she knew it would be fine”. She didn’t kill any of her children so I guess.. she was right? Lol  
She presents herself as this very kind, very Christian very generous person but I guess I just realised who she really is when she thinks no one is listening. I’m so disappointed and it kind of broke the trust I had towards her. I’m sad and upset.

Edit : to everyone on this sub, thank you so much for the outpouring support, you are simply amazing. You showed me what being a mom really means. It made me feel validated, heard and understood… and it feels so nice. That’s exactly how I want my child to feel when she’s with us.

There were no direct dialogue, I only needed to answer the questions of the judge, but every time I was talking she would interrupt me and deny and sometimes insult me even though she wasn’t allowed to talk when it was my turn so she quickly got in trouble for doing it, even they we telling her to stop she wouldn’t stop so they almost stopped the confrontation a few times. I’m confident she just proved me right, she might be prosecuted and I don’t even feel sorry or guilty. Today she proved me that she’s really a pos.

155,I didn’t have kids for a good reason and I am mad some people consider me selfish,"On Wednesday Pope Francis said married couples who have pets but not children are selfish.

I didn’t get married or have kids, for good reason.  I am a former Catholic, so not bound by his comments, but still feel hurt.

I am 54.  I am gay.  When I was fertile, same sex marriage wasn’t legal.  I didn’t want to parent alone.  Although many women are great single parents, I wanted a partner.

Also, I have bipolar disorder.  I didn’t want to go off meds to get pregnant or pass on my condition.  Again, others may make different choices, those were just mine.

I don’t feel I was selfish at all.  I wanted kids, I just didn’t think I would make a good parent.

Mom, why do I care so much about what other people think?  How can I be at peace with the choices I make and let go of what others say?

I am glad I rescued a cat.  She is 9 now and we are happy.  I also mentor younger people at work.

I’ve been writing this text message for 10 years in the back of my head building up the courage to actually write it and send it. 

In that 10 year journey I’ve also realized that I am exhausted of doing all of the emotional labor for you both constantly. If I have to tell you why this text is coming, it’s because you have refused out right to do any of the work required of you to be healthy, available parents. 

Because of that, I’ll just get right to the point. The pain you have caused me over the years has become too big to ignore. I asked myself recently if a friend had done to me just a few of the things you did to me as a child what I would do. The answer was that I would no longer have them in my life. So, because of that and 10 years of research and therapy trying to figure out why you treat me the way you do, I have chosen myself and my well being over our relationship. 

Please do not contact me via text or phone or social media ever again. If there is an emergency, you are welcome to tell me through Nathan or Danielle but I will not be answering the phone for any other family member’s name and I will be blocking your phone numbers and email. 

I am exhausted but I am finally standing up for myself. Your behavior during my childhood and especially during my teenage years was and is unacceptable. I’m done with our relationship for the foreseeable future. 

If anything changes for me, I will reach out to you. If you attempt to contact me any further I will simply ignore any contact. I am moving very soon so please do not send any mail or show up at my old place.

I strongly encourage you BOTH to seek medication, help, and therapy to heal your own trauma and pain, so you can stop hurting others.

The day came when they said I could no longer conceive and we had to give up trying. After years of hopeful appointments,  countless injections, and hormone fluctuations from all the pills and shots, I was finally told by the doctor that I needed to stop. After that, it all seemed to blur.

It took maybe 2 or 3 years to finally get come off all the effects of all the hormones that I took and it also sent me into early menopause. The day I realized that I hit menopause, felt like the day any last little bit of hope had ended. I don't know. I think I felt there was still a glimmer left because I was still menstruating. When my period ended, a panic and depression soon set in.

It's been 3 years now. It feels like a bottomless pit of despair and sadness that plagues me often, especially when Mother's Day is approaching. I won't have any children or grandchildren making me Mother's Day cards. There will be no school made crafts. No phone calls. No nothing. It's empty. It's truly emotionally empty.

I don't recall who mentioned this site to me but whoever you are, thank you. This sub has saved my life in so many ways. I enjoy being a Mom For A Minute to so many of you. It fills me up so much to be part of your life even for a 30 second reply, an upvote, and even some private follow ups. Sometimes I just feel so incredible helping others out in this group.

168,"Mom, I think my husband sexually assaulted me…I’m scared to tell you about it.","I take sleeping pills pretty frequently because I struggle to sleep. I also lost my virginity to rape when I happened to be asleep and woke up to a guy in me. My partner knows this.


The other night, I woke up to my partner inside me. I was so exhausted I just fell back asleep, but when I finally woke up the next morning I couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. He apologized and told me he didn’t want me to feel traumatized and he wouldn’t put me through that again and we moved on….but a couple nights ago I woke up to him trying to pull my sweats down. When he realized I was awake he stopped and tried to act like nothing was happening, and when I went back to sleep he did it again (edit: when I say again, I mean he pulled my sweats down again. Before he could do anything else I left the room and ended up sleeping on the couch). 


I’m so scared. I feel like I don’t know the person I married. I don’t have a single friend I can talk to…and that’s why I’m also trauma bonded to him, because I’ve had nobody to go to in the past. 


I feel so alone and confused and I just want to tell you, but I’m scared you’ll say I deserved it or it’s not SA because I’m his wife…I just want somebody to talk to. I’m so alone.


Edit 2: for more context, he’s a sex addict. He struggled with porn when he and I first met and has been clean now for a year and going to therapy, couples counseling, SAA, he has a sponsor and is on step 4 of his work. Our therapist seems to think he has a lot of love for me…I’m starting to wonder if he’s also manipulating the therapist. I genuinely don’t know this man now, I don’t know who does, and I don’t know WHO I know or who I can trust anymore. This feels so fucked up. I moved across states for him and my car broke down so now I’m kind of stuck here, I’ve got multiple dogs and exotic pets with him that his job hours don’t allow him to take care of and they matter more to me than anything in the world…I just can’t leave them. 

I feel so confused because like I mentioned in one of my comments, he’s come a long way. We never fight, he’s so supportive of me and my needs-if I break down or get angry he’s always been next to me and communicated openly with me and did so much to improve. If I have problems with him he fixes them quickly, and so now I’m just lost and confused because I can’t tell if it’s all fake? I can’t tell if this was a mistake, or if he’s just really good at being somebody he’s not just to gain peoples trust.


I also want to add he does know I know, i told him and he apologized and his sponsor said he thinks this happened because he wasn’t communicating with me enough and so he’d take his stress to bed and take it out on me inappropriately. He said he’s going to improve his communication and for now he will sleep in the living room so I can feel safe and I can lock the doors to the BR and stuff. I haven’t spoken to him. I didn’t forgive him or say that was okay. I was just silent. I dont know what to think, I’m trying to get to our couples therapist as an emergency appt.


Edit 3: Well he just got home. Sat next to me and told me he was sorry again, said he knows he's responsible for my pain and he wants to assure me he hasn't relapsed and he's still doing all his step work and I can speak to his sponsor if I need to confirm anything and he went on about how he feels terrible and asked if there's anything he can do to help me right now. I know you guys are going to say he’s manipulating me and I agree. I still haven’t said anything.

Edit 4: I just spoke with his sponsor. His sponsor is pissing me off by beating around the bush but based off his reaction, I don’t think the full story was shared. He refuses to tell me what my husband told him though, as if I don’t already fucking know the real story, and as if it couldn’t prevent me from getting to safety. I officially hate his sponsor. I’m sitting in the shower, scared to turn it off or get out, because his sponsor isn’t responding now that I’ve admitted I think my husband is manipulating everybody. I’m worried he told my husband. So I’m just sitting in the shower…I don’t want to get out. I don’t want to deal with this. I don’t think my therapist thought I was serious enough because I haven’t heard back about an emergency appointment. I don’t know what to do.",rm5tvw,1764,337,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/rm5tvw/mom_i_think_my_husband_sexually_assaulted_meim/

177,My mom took away my sense of safety with four words. My dad defended her. Was my mom in the right?,"Last night, I (16F) was doing my laundry. I am assuming that I accidentally left a napkin or piece of paper in one of my pockets, though, because my clothes all came out covered with paper-y dust. I told my mom (I was not sure whether rewashing my clothes would be a good idea), but she reacted…badly.

She started screaming at me for ruining her laundry machine and all of my clothes (nothing is ruined; I just needed to shake the clothes out and use a hand vacuum in the machine). Then she started finding other things to scream at me about:

* Didn't I know that some of my clothes needed to be handwashed?
* Why was I being so spiteful? Did I really think that I knew *better* than her?
* Didn't I know not that certain types of clothes were not supposed to be put in the dryer (none of my clothes even went into the dryer, so I genuinely do not know where she pulled this from)?
* Why was I so insistent on making her life harder?

The laundry room is a small room near the garage. At the time of this incident, I was standing in the corner of the room, and my mom was blocking the door. Then she shouted at me, **""I'm going to slap you!""**

All I could think about was how my head was right next to the wall—if she slapped me, my head would slam into it. She was blocking the only exit, and the room was small. I was already terrified that she would hurt me, but then, she confirmed it.

When I was 13, she promised to never slap me again. Before that, it was rare, but it was never done as a punishment. Only out of anger. For example, a lot of times, It was very difficult for me to fall asleep. I was also very anxious, so I would usually wake her up and sleep in her room/on the floor. I know that it was inconvenient for her, and I know that I was not an easy child to deal with. Usually, once her patience ran out, she would only scream at me and threaten me with punishments. A few times, though, she would get mad enough to slap me. Then, she would promise to never do it again. She did not keep that promise until I made it so that I was physically always out of arm's reach. Being slapped was rare, but it was scary.

As of yesterday, she has not slapped me in years, but when she said that…it was terrifying. She did not even end up *doing* it, but it was still so terrifying.

My dad was more understanding about my mistake, but he said that I made a mess for my mom to clean up (I said that I would clean it up myself, but my mom said that I was not allowed to clean it—then she got angry at me for making her clean it), so she was justified.

I know that it is only a slap—that *did not even end up happening*—and I should not have been so afraid, but I can't make it stop. I kept flinching away from my mom after she said that, and she started screaming at me for being so immature and for acting like she was cruel. I was terrified last night, and I woke up feeling hollow and shaky. I still feel this way.

A part of me says that it is only a slap; that it is not a big deal and that I need to get over it. After all, nothing even ended up happening.

Another part of me, though, says that she is in the wrong. I do not know how to feel, but I am scared.

Last night, even though she did not end up slapping me, she proved that she is still *willing* to do it. She was more than ready. I was trapped in the corner, and if she had chosen to do it, then I would not have been able to escape. My head would have slammed into the wall, *hard*. I cannot stop thinking about that.

I already know that my mother is not…the *best* parent in the world. I have posted about her in the past (you can check my other posts if you are curious), both on this subreddit and on others. A while back, I posted in this subreddit about how she was going to force me to get my eyebrows threaded. Last week, she finally did it, and it hurt like hell. She is now talking about having me get my face lasered.

Apologies for that tangent, but back to my original point—is my dad right? Would I have deserved it?",rfjy90,1720,647,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/rfjy90/my_mom_took_away_my_sense_of_safety_with_four/

I went to the police and filed a report. They took pictures of my injuries. He was arrested at home. I started the process of pressing charges.

His family has been calling and texting me non-stop about how I’m overreacting and how my actions are hurting my kids and will affect my husband for the rest of his life. They’re so mean and hurtful. They call to just yell at me. I’ve stopped answering my phone and opening my texts.

An officer just came by to take a statement and take pictures of our home. He had a picture of my husband for me to identify. Seeing him smiling in the photo broke me. I loved him so much. I still do. Our kids love him. I don’t want to hurt him.

I just need reassurance that I’m doing the right thing by pressing charges. I feel so lost.

EDIT: Thank you for all the virtual hugs and support! I want to reach out to every single one of you, because I’ve read every comment and each one has been that little extra strength. I will do my best to reply, but right now I’m making spaghetti for the kids and setting up a movie night/camp out so we can all sleep together. My brother took time off work and he is flying out in a couple days. He’s going to help me find a lawyer.

UPDATE: My husband is being charged with a felony for assaulting me in front of our children. He will be held without bail for 48 hours, then he is not allowed to come home or have any contact with me or the kids for an additional 48. If he needs anything from the house, I will be notified and he will have to have a police escort. So I have until Wednesday to get things sorted. My state apparently takes domestic assault very seriously.

Because I haven’t been responding to my phone, my in-laws have taken to driving to our house and talking to the kids while they play outside in the yard. They keep trying to get them to go over to “aunty’s or uncle’s house”. They entice the kids with sleepovers and playing with their cousins and ice cream parties. I keep having to tell them no and make up some excuse because I’m trying not to create another scene in front of the kids, but I feel like I’m going to break at any moment. I’ve notified the police. My older son is getting mad at me for denying him a fun weekend on top of “calling the cops on dad”. I’m trying to keep it together, but oh man is this hard.

I want to have my own funds. I want to buy my own things. I want to invest. I want to contribute financially to the household.

I searched for jobs and applied relentlessly to no avail. I either got rejected or lowballed. So, I continued freelancing. I eventually stopped the job hunt and came to terms with my situation. Heck, I even started feeling content. Then, a company contacted me out of the blue for an opportunity.

They ticked all of my boxes! Dream industry? (check!) Hybrid work setup? (check!) Position? (Upgrade! Double check!) Pay? (Triple of what I used to earn! Jackpot!) The hiring process was taxing. But I really wanted this and gave it my all, and guess what? I GOT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But kiddos, I want you to know that you're all so precious and worthy of love, each of you, exactly as you are. Your sexual orientation is not a sin. Your gender is good and valid. And even if you *are* ""confused,"" as many homophobes/biphobes/transphobes say...heck, I'm confused about a lot of things, but I'm still incredibly queer.

Posting here because my mom is unsupportive and generally terrible. 

I’ve been married to my husband for 8 years. We have 3 kids, a beautiful home, stable jobs, etc. but he’s emotionally unavailable. I’ve been alone in my marriage for the last 3 years. Begging for attention, any time together. Beyond “well you’re just busy with kids!” I’m talking: idk his coworkers names and he has no idea what I do for a living. When we’re together without the kids, he’s on his phone or makes himself busy avoiding me. I’ve begged for quality time with him - 20 minutes on the couch talking about our lives. Occasional texts during the day. Something. But he doesn’t do it. And makes me feel horrible for asking. Last year he forgot my birthday and our wedding anniversary. I took a week off over the summer for he and I to have a staycation. He spent the days doing anything but spending time with me. 

There’s no abuse. No infidelity. No major red flags. But I’m totally alone in our marriage. No emotional connection. No sex. No romance. No attraction. No interaction. 

I’ve begged him to get couples counseling, individual therapy. I’ve told him exactly what o need and how to meet my needs. And he hasn’t. 

So I’ve made the decision to leave. Being alone feels less lonely than being in our relationship. I’m extremely depressed. I just want out. 

My own mom told me “you’ve made your bed” and “stay for the kids” and “you just need exercise and more sunlight and positive thoughts.” 

But this is a decision I’ve spent years considering, months actively planning. I’m 34 years old with a good head on my shoulders. I’m not choosing this lightly. 

I could use a mom who believes in my judgment, hears how I’m feeling, and cares about my well-being beyond “how will this look to the family.”",z6hg06,1454,241,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/z6hg06/hi_mom_im_about_to_leave_my_marriage/
222,I (34) failed my son (18) and he hates me. How can I show him I did the best I could providing for him?,"I had my son when I was 16. My parents were very conservative so they asked me to leave there house. I lived with his dad until I turned 17 and he left.

So we had to move to government housing. I worked all the hours I could get cleaning at a hotel but still needed help. I was lucky to be eligible for food stamps.

My son was very self conscious because we got assistance. I was able to keep us fed and have clothes even though it was mostly cheap things to wear which he hated. He got made fun of in school alot because of the clothes he had to wear. 

I admit I didn't buy the healthiest foods. I was more focused on getting a lot so we'd always have something. He is overweight and was teased for that to. 

I can't afford to send him to college and he couldn't  get enough financial aid. 

So I did try hard to provide but in his eyes I failed. He resents me. 

He is always asking me why I didn't give him up for adoption or let my parents raise him. Looking back maybe he would have had a better chance but at 16 I didn't see that. 

All I want is to be able to tell my son I tried my hardest and I'm sorry. He says when he graduates high school he'll leave and not see me anymore. My heart is hurting and I do feel bad for him.

He would flirt like an elementary school boy, picking on me and calling me names. It didn't bother me because I just dished it right back to him. I knew he liked me but I just am not interested. Not only did I just get out of a 4 year relationship, but he is 10 years older than me and still gossips like a school girl. 

Last week my work dad came up to me and asked me about someone I had talked to (for a week). After some pestering, he told me that John told him ""well I could have her if I wanted her, but she's been messing around with a and b and I don't like girls who sleep around"" 

I havent even done anything. I haven't talked to him all week and last night he asked me what was wrong and I told him ""I heard what you said about me and that's not cool. 'you could have me, but I sleep around'? I've been with 1 person in 5 years and talked to another. Keep me name out of your mouth"" 

He looked stunned. I'm so angry. I thought he was a friend. Turns out he just wanted to fuck me. Great. Men are disgusting.",rja4sd,1414,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/rja4sd/fucking_incel_at_work/

246,I stood up for myself and it had really nasty consequences,"I spent the weekend at my boyfriend’s parents’ house. I’ve been dating my boyfriend (R) for 2 years and have been best friends with him for 6. We’re 22 years old. During dinner last night, his dad made a really racist joke that, unbeknownst to him at the time, was targeted at my blood. I tried to brush it off but R and I were both shocked and uncomfortable, I managed to discreetly pull him aside and tell him how it upset me. He said he was upset too, that it was inappropriate and he’d talk to his dad after dinner.

He did, very gently, and his dad flipped out on us and me specifically. He doubled down on the racist joke, saying that the stereotype was true and that he had more experience than us. He called me ungrateful for disrespecting him after they did so much for us this weekend. R did not tolerate what his dad was saying and stood up for me but this only led to a larger conflict. His mom said we went too far by calling him out, and that I ruined dinner by being standoffish after the “joke”. As of this morning they’re ignoring me completely and acting like I’m not there. R and I are trying to get back to our apartment ASAP, but it’s hard because we’re in a rural area right now and neither of us have a car, we’ll make it work but it’ll be a few more hours. R is completely on my side, but it worries me that he’s talking about cutting ties with his family until they apologize. I don’t want to come between him and his parents.

I don’t trust his parents anymore. I guess I need some kind of reassurance from another mom (or parent) out there that I wasn’t out of line. Thank you for reading.

Update: A few people mentioned wanting to know when I was home safe. I am, and I apologize for taking so long to update! Thank you so much to everyone who offered support, it really means the world and reading your replies have been very helpful when I’m struggling to validate myself.

254,Mom how do I deal with my roommate? She stole my asthma inhaler because she was angry at me and I needed it.,"I 20F have asthma and lately it has been flaring up. My roommate 25F and I are both in college. We got into a fight on Saturday. I meal prep because I'm pretty busy with work and school. I go to school full time and I work 5 days a week. It saves me time and money. I also started eating healthier and I haven't been skipping meals since I started meal prepping. A few days ago I noticed that some of my meals were missing. I asked my roommate about it and she told me that her and her boyfriend ate a few of my meals. 

I was upset and I told her that she can't just take my food like that. Especially without asking. She told me that I'm making a big deal out of nothing but that she wouldn't do it again. On Saturday I noticed that another one of my meals were missing. I confronted my roommate about it and she told me that she ate another one of my meals. I got upset again. I told her that she needs to stop taking my food and that the next time she does it I'm going to make her pay me back for the food she took. She started yelling at me. She called me a overreacting bitch then she left. 

It was a really long day. I went to bed very early that day because I was exhausted. I had a 6 hour shift at work and I spent the rest of the day studying for finals. I usually leave my inhaler on my nightstand so that I can easily access it. I woke up in the middle of the night because my asthma was flaring up. I was coughing and I was having breathing problems. I needed my inhaler but it wasn't on my nightstand when I looked. I thought that was odd because I remembered leaving it on my nightstand. I searched my room for it but I couldn't find it. I thought that maybe I had misplaced it. 

It was around 1 in the morning and I really needed an inhaler. No where was open at that time for me to get one. I drank some black coffee but that didn't help much. I ended up calling my friend that lives in the same building as me. She also has asthma and she uses the same inhaler as me. She had an extra inhaler and she brought it to me. I felt bad for waking her up but I really needed an inhaler. In the morning my roommate asked me why I was making so much noise last night. I told her that I needed my inhaler but I couldn't find it. So I had to call a friend to bring one for me. 

She had this really guilty look on her face. Then she confessed to stealing my inhaler. She told me that she was still really mad at me because I have so much food but wouldn't let her eat any of it. So she came into my room while I was sleeping. She said that she wanted to get back at me. She said that she planned on taking something valuable that I would miss. Then she just saw my inhaler on my nightstand and she decided to take it. She apologized. She told me that it was an impulsive decision and that she wasn't thinking straight. Apparently the anger caused her to do it. Then she gave me back my inhaler. 

I was furious. I asked her if she was crazy. Like who in their right mind would take someone's asthma inhaler because their angry with them. I told her that if it was worse I could have died. She told me to relax and again she told me that I was overreacting. I was so angry at her and I still am. I don't think I can handle living with her for much longer. My roommate keeps telling me that I'm overreacting but I don't think I am.

I was sexually assaulted by my step-father from age 10 to 19. My mother took away my access to the car, phone, internet, and friends and family when I threatened to go to the police. We lived secluded in the countryside. I eventually  found away to contact people without her knowing and reported everything to the police and he was convicted for his crimes. My mother stayed with him and chose to support him throughout court instead of me.  I havnt been able to attend a family function in so long. Im left out. 

Well today I called to tell you Im pregnant, Mom. You were so happy. But then I had to tell you about the choices youve made. When you chose that man over me, you gave up more than you realized.

There will be no family Christmas for my child to miss you on, to feel left out, lonely, confused, unloved. No Im not sick. No, Im not crazy. No my husband didnt make me say this. No I dont ""always do this to you"" because Im the victim not you. 

No, I dont hate you. Thank you, for teaching me that I am  capable of being the mother you are not. 

Keeping you and your pedophile husband away from my child is such an easy decision. Thanks to you, I am living proof, myself, that you failed an easy test.

But anyway yesterday I went on fb where I’m friends with some relatives back home and they all made post about her death and how great she was and blabla. None of them sent me a message which I thought was odd. The first post I saw was her goddaughter and she never mentioned my mom’s name she just used “my godmother” so at first I though it couldn’t be her but then I saw other post and then saw the death announcement. In France on the obituary, they put all the loved ones /relatives names on it, on hers,  her sisters, brothers and nieces/goddaughter and nephews are mentioned and I’m not. How can you not put the name of her daughter on it? How can you not tell her own daughter that her mother’s dead? I didn’t ask for any of it. I didn’t ask to live with my dad. I’m not even sure how I should react. I’m just broken, she was still my mom. But I guess she didn’t want me to know and that hurts so bad.

I found out yesterday that I’m pregnant. I have a septum in my uterus that would cause any pregnancy to be high risk to me and the fetus. My mom knows this but I know that if I tell her I need an abortion she will tell me it was gods plan that I got pregnant and I need to see it through. My boyfriend has been so incredibly supportive and he even took the initiative to call the clinics himself instead of making me do it. I just need a mom to tell me it’s gonna be okay. I wish so badly I could talk to my mom about it. 

Also, any tips on how to get rid of the nausea and morning sickness would be greatly appreciated. It’s so bad that it’s keeping me awake at night.

269,My husband had a heart attack,"He’s not even 40. This wasn’t supposed to happen. I don’t know what to do. I want to ask my mother in law for help, but her son just had a heart attack. I have a five year old and twin two year olds. My family lives in another country and we barely talk. My mom is dead. 

My husband isn’t waking up. He’s my entire life. Please just tell me what to do. Please just tell me what to tell my children. My five year old saw him have the heart attack. I couldn’t get him out of the room before David went down. He saw it. If David dies, that’s his last memory of his father. 

Reddit has told me what to do before. Please just tell me what to do.


EDIT: He’s alive. He’s not awake yet, but I’m in his hospital room and he’s alive. We’re still piecing together what happened completely, but it’s looking like David had a minor congenital heart defect that has managed to go unnoticed for a very long time. For months now, we’ve been attributing certain symptoms to a slow recovery from COVID, and actually his heart was starting to fail. 

My in laws have my children. My father in law has spent the day with them, distracting them. I don’t know yet how he explained my husband collapsing and my doing CPR until the ambulance arrived, but apparently a fire truck came with the ambulance  and  he’s still excited about that. Thank the heavens for fire trucks. 

I know it’s not much of an update yet. I don’t really know what to put. I’ve spent the day not knowing anything. If I should pray, if I should be angry. Who to be angry at. This man in the bed, covered in tubes, he doesn’t look like the overprotective bear of a man I married. My world has been turned on it’s head and shaken and I don’t know if it will ever be the same again.

270,I am officially cancer free!,"Hey Moms, Sisters, and Aunties of Reddit-

I don’t really have anyone to tell and my momma is long gone so I’m hoping I can share it here- I am elated. 

Back in February I started to get hammered by nonstop illnesses and infections.  My blood has always been wonky and my doctor has always kept a close eye on it- but paired with the new symptoms (always sick or if I got a cut, you bet it would get infected) I was shipped off to oncology because my blood was even weirder than before.  

After reviewing my history and blood draws my oncologist thought I had a blood disease called lymphoma.  Months and months of still getting sick all the time, antibiotics, with wonky blood draws happening.  But- specialized tests and scans came back negative.  

Today, I officially graduated from oncology and I’m off to immunology and infectious disease (basically they now strongly think I have an auto immune disorder) and I am officially cancer free.  

Yesterday my kid celebrated his 15th birthday and I was internally panicking I’d be gone early like my mom while pretending like everything was normal around my kid.  Today I feel freer than I’ve ever felt before in my life.  A weight has been lifted.  

Sure we don’t know for sure what it is quite yet, but the list is getting shorter and I have the most amazing team of doctors ever.  I know very soon I’ll be healthy and have energy and go a solid month without running a fever.  I’ve finally made progress when everything looked so so bad.  

I wish I could tell my mom and give her a hug today and celebrate with her.  Instead I’ll be celebrating with my kiddo and giving him the biggest hug in the world.  Not sure why I’m sort of crying typing this out.   But after 7 months of ongoing testing and appointments and more needles and pokes than I could have imagined, I’ve been cleared of cancer.",wv8brc,1236,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/wv8brc/i_am_officially_cancer_free/

He even had the nerve to try and manipulate me into thinking I wanted it so I could have a “clean slate with someone who wants children with me”.

283,I agreed to let a guy who I had recently broken up with to come over for Thanksgiving,"Without writing a novel here, I (27f) agreed to let a guy I went out with for a couple months recently to come over for Thanksgiving today. I live over a thousand miles away from any family and don't know anyone here too well. He texted me last week and asked if he could still come, since he had no other plans, and we originally agreed to spend it together.

I had originally ended this relationship because I began seeing a ton of red flags and had a bad feeling deep down. There were signs of manipulation, gas lighting, unresolved anger issues, etc. But like the idiot people pleaser I am, said yes to him coming over, because well, spending a holiday alone sucks.

Everything was going somewhat okay until a few hours ago. I was cooking and he tried to make a move on me. I politely said no, it's not a good idea, plus even if I did want to, I was having really painful irritation in that area from an allergic reaction to a soap I used in a bubble bath the other day. This person told me that I was ""making excuses"". That he ""Didn't give a f\*%& about my feelings, about my thanksgiving dinner, he was just here to f\*&% me"". I was so appalled. Told him to absolutely get out of my home. He then said I had to give him a ride if I didn't want to have sex with him and wanted him to leave (discovered when I was seeing him that he had no car/license due to several DUIS). I opened the door and told him to leave. Obviously got called a bunch of names, verbally attacked, etc. I feel so stupid for even allowing this person to come into my home, JUST being I didn't want to be alone on a holiday. I'm so angry at myself for allowing this person to walk over me in our short relationship and today. 

&#x200B;

I'm very far from any family or friends. I didn't want to text/call any of them and have them worry about me on a day that should be full of happiness. I needed to get this off my chest to a mother figure. I'm trying to pull myself together, enjoy some good food and movies by myself, and go for a nice jog later. I appreciate you all reading this.

289,"Mom, I'm mourning the life I'll never have","Hi, mom. 

I turned thirty last month, and it finally hit me that I'll never be a parent. I told everyone a long time ago that I didn't want to be, but that’s not true. The reality is that I realized pretty quickly that it would be impossible. I don’t have any useful skills (writing is fun, I'm good at it, but the chance of it making me enough money to live on is so, so small), and I will never have the means to support myself fully with the way the world is going, let alone a child. Even at $15 an hour I still can't afford a studio apartment around here. Every day is a struggle. I feel like I've let you down. 

I had such a good childhood. You did your best with what we had, and I was happy. But people can't live like that anymore. We don’t have the means. The media wonders why the birthrate is so low, like it's some kind of mystery, but it isn't. I did what I was supposed to do, went to school, got a job, but it wasn't enough. It will never be enough.

Next month I'll start my hormone replacement therapy. They'll ask me if I want to get a procedure done first, if I want to have my eggs frozen just in case I change my mind, but I'll say no. Because that, too, is too expensive. And there's no mind to change. It wasn't my decision, was it. Not really. I wanted it so bad, but I will never be able to. It wouldn’t be fair to the kid, would it. Where would I even be able to go with a baby? A street corner? A shelter? No kid deserves that. If I had a baby, I would want it to thrive, and I can't offer that opportunity.

I can't tell you any of this because you will think you did something wrong, and that would break my heart. You did so well. You were so warm. But the world just got too cold. 

It's not your fault. 

Next month, I'll say no, and I'll let go of the names I picked out inside my head. I'll tuck them in a box somewhere in my mind and tape it shut so it'll hurt a little less. My body will finally start to look the way I feel, and I'll quietly mourn the lives that will never grow inside it. 

The names were Molly for a girl, and Morgan for a boy. I think you would have liked them. I'm sorry.",rwb21x,1192,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/rwb21x/mom_im_mourning_the_life_ill_never_have/

299,I finally told my parents the reason for my divorce in 2009.. in 2022,"I finally told my parents the reason for my 2009 divorce.. in 2022

Throw away as I am very active on my normal account.

I got married in 2019, which did not last 3 months. This was 10 and a half years after my first divorce.

For most of peak covid, I was being blamed for both of my divorces. I was useless, couldn't ""hold up a marriage"", an embarrassment as a daughter.

My 2nd ex husband was an abusive, toxic drug addict, who abused me verbally, mentally, sexuallt and financially. It lasted 88 days. 

I have a now-14 year old daughter from my 1st marriage. Since the beginning of 2022, she had been sitting on my case that I needed to get hold of her absent father, as she loved him, and hated me. This is despite that he pretends she doesn't exist since 2009.

When we divorced in 2009, I cited his unfaithfulness as a reason for the divorce. It was partially true.

When my daughter began harassing me about her sperm donor, my parents began the blame game again. They have always treated me terribly for leaving abusive situations..

I finally snapped and told them the truth.

In 2007, I gave birth at 8 months of gestation to my first daughter. She died at 17 days old. Ten months later, my 2nd daughter was born. We were in dire financial straits and our relationship/marriage was falling apart. Both due to the PTSD of losing a newborn, finances and I had severe post natal depression. 

As she turned a year, behind my back, my ex husband negotiated with his parents, and brother and SIL, to exchange my child, so that they would finance a business for him/us. My ex's brother and wife were unable to conceive, and because they were older than us, the only ""correct"" thing was for them to have a baby, as we didn't ""deserve"" a baby.

This entire negotiation was served to me over Easter, where my ex and his family lured us to their family home - 12 hours away from where we lived. I told my ex that our marriage was over - and there was no going back.

I had told no one of this, I was so humiliated and embarrassed to be put into this situation. I held this to me, from 2009 to 2022.

Since my daughter is now 14, I was tired of being the ""bad"" parent keeping her from her absent dad and even worse family.

I finally grew a pair and told my family this (my parents and daughter). We all cried and it felt like therapy. It also felt like they understood why I keep choosing being single and why I refused to make a relationship with an abuser work.

It felt like I put down over a decades worth of emotional baggage.. My relationship with everyone at home has improved and I no longer am labelled embarrassing or anything to that effect. 

Yes I'm still in other forms of therapy that are also helping with self esteem and confidence issues. 

Please do not be like me and blame yourself for how people are choosing to treat you. You are wonderful and amazing, and no one deserves to treat you as a  second class citizen. Do not allow your dignity to be taken from you.",vvy9v3,1160,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/vvy9v3/i_finally_told_my_parents_the_reason_for_my/
300,"Hey kiddo,","If you are part of this sub, that probably means that I am not part of your life.  Either physically, emotionally, or both.  

I'm so sorry about that.  I may not ever tell you that, to your face, but at some point I carried you in my womb.  At some point, I gently rubbed my belly, as I thought about your future.  Or, you could be adopted, in which case I carried you in my heart.  

I know things are different now.  You are different too.  But sweetie, that's not a bad thing.  Who you are today is exactly who you need to be.  And, if you aren't quite there yet - that's ok too.  We are all growing, in this journey we call life.  

One thing you should know is that whatever words I have said to you, or actions I have done to you....as much pain as I may have brought you....it does nothing to change who you are.  You are still whole, and beautiful, and loved, and very much, an important part of this universe.  My words will never change that.  

If you are holding on to anger towards me, know that letting that go, doesn't mean you are excusing my actions.  It just means that you are no longer allowing bitterness towards me to run your life.  Forgiveness is for your benefit.
  
Your identity is yours alone, and no one can ever take that from you.  I know you crave to have my approval.  I know you just want to make me proud.  But if you never get that... know that there are others who ARE so very proud of you.  There are others who are standing in your corner, cheering you on.

303,"I'm not your daughter, I'm your son","Hi Mum,

When I first told you, three months ago, you said you were supportive, something that I'm endlessly grateful for. Then you asked me whether I had been 'convinced' into thinking I was trans. The answer is no. I've spent a decade trying to convince myself that I'm not transgender but I can't live that way anymore. When I came down for dad's birthday you said that you would both refer to me by my deadname because 'dad isn't ready'. I understand, it's an adjustment. I also noticed that you would still deadname me when dad wasn't around, so maybe you're not ready either. I don't know how to tell you how much it hurts when you do this, I worry that you'll never see me as your son. Last Sunday at the end of the call you called me your 'lovely girl' and I spent the rest of the day crying. I wish it wasn't like this.

305,I don't know how to not be angry about a stupid ham,"My boyfriend threw away 3/4ths of a large ham I made for Thanksgiving. We've talked it out and it wasn't out of malice or anything, and he's very apologetic, but I don't know how to let the stupid ham go. I've been on and off crying angry over it for over 7 hours, and every time I think about it I just get angry all over again. I can't ruin my relationship over a ham, but I can't let the ham go. I think half the reason I'm so upset is because I had planned and told him about how I was going to use it to make soup like my Mom's, and now I can't and I'm upset and I wasted money on that ham when we're band now have to come up with different meals to make instead and how to I stop sobbing over a freaking ham? I just want to stop being angry at him and stop obsessing over it, and the more I am upset the more he gets angry at me and the more I just wish I had never bought this stupid ham

Edit: I appreciate everyone's comments so much.  Thank you all for the support, advice and nice things. One thing I phrased badly in my original post is the anger part- my boyfriend did not yell or actually get ANGRY at me. He was very apologetic and I understand his reasons for throwing out the ham after we discussed it, i was not clear enough about my plans and he had his own reasons, the issue was that I could and still can't stop being angry about the ham, and that let to the hours and hours long meltdown, that then made me freak out about not being able to calm down which was making him understandably exasperated, which made me more freaked out about him being angry at me and just circled and spiraled. I am not good at phrasing things, but this really wasn't anything malicious on his part and we have a great relationship,  which is why me being unable to let the ham go became and is being a big strain.

Some of you mentioned how it's a straw that broke the camels back situation and I really do agree with that. The ham isn't the world ender I feel like it is, it's just what my brain has fixated on as a bandaid. In my mind, if I had the ham everything would be fine, but more than likely I would have just had this breakdown farther along the line over something less serious to me.

He offered to buy a new ham but that's not the point. I want the ham really bad, I really liked having it, but I don't want a new one. The whole reason I was so excited for meals with the ham was because it was saving and stretching money and I wanted to recreat my Mom's post Thanksgiving meals (she did pass) and getting a new ham just brings me back to square one of more sunk cost, more preparation, and just ruins it for me. This is where I think me and him hit a wall. He doesn't understand why getting a new ham won't fix it and I'm not eloquent enough to explain why it wont.

Thank you everyone",z7l7co,1157,170,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/z7l7co/i_dont_know_how_to_not_be_angry_about_a_stupid_ham/

However, we now have an adult man as a roommate and I can’t keep any food or drinks in the house long enough.","[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/u0t696/hey_mom_my_wife_and_i_have_lived_together_for_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Hi moms!! WOOF what a wakeup call in this original post!! I truly thought I was the one at fault, and I didn’t even consider what a mind fuck situation I’d been manipulated into. 

Immediately after I got so much advice on that post, I did the following:

- we stopped doing his laundry, prepping his food, and cleaning his dishes 

- eventually, he ran out of dishes and laundry and I think that was his “oh shit” moment 

- we went on a “cleaning strike” and didn’t clean anything he complained about - quickly making the house pretty gross and not to his standards 

- we stopped buying him groceries (he is now having to cook for himself and it’s not going well) 


And the update is coming because, miraculously, he GOT AN APARTMENT WITHOUT OUR HELP. He will no longer be homeless without me finding and calling and sourcing living spaces. He’s got a move out date!! He’s leaving!

AND he miraculously found a daycare and pricing without my help, and it’s cheaper than us. So we get to have our own lives back!!! 

All of y’all were right, and the MINUTE we stopped being his housewife/mother/maids, he had to reckon with all we do and immediately had a rude awakening. 

I cannot thank y’all enough. I’ll update again when we have our home back, but THANK YOU. I LOVE ALL OF YOU. 

To any of my little siblings reading this - the collective group of moms here are amazing. Don’t be afraid to reach out. You’ll get gentle awakenings and advice if you need it. Your big sister is here for you. 

Lesson learned. No one will ever violate my boundaries like this again. Thanks, moms!!!",u7fcwf,1135,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/u7fcwf/update_success_hey_mom_my_wife_and_i_have_lived/

I'm considering breaking up with him over this but I'm not sure if I should.,"I 20F got into a fight with my boyfriend 22M last night. We went out on a date and we were driving home. He was angry at me because I didn't want to spend the night at his place. I told him that I was exhausted and that all I wanted to do was go home and sleep. He really wanted me to spend the night but I didn't because I knew what would happen if I went over to his place and I really wasn't in the mood. He has some anger issues and can get angry over the smallest things sometimes. We started yelling at each other then he got frustrated. He stopped the car and told me to get out. I told him to stop being stupid then he yelled at me and told me to get out again so I did. Then he drove off and left me on the side of the road. It was around 11 p.m. at night. I had to walk home alone and it was freezing cold. I'm was so pissed off at him and I still am. I haven't spoken to him since but he as been calling me and texting me all day trying to apologize. One of my roommates think that I should break up with him and the other one thinks that I should give him another chance. I am considering breaking up with him but I'm still don't know if I should. Am I overreacting? He has never done anything like this before.

322,"Mom, I’m being eaten alive by shame.","Yesterday I quit my job without notice. My coworkers will be discovering how much I’ve put off, how much I didn’t do. 

I’d been so far behind all year, struggling with severe burnout, depression, and CPTSD. I had been in a different role at the same company and severely burnt out from years of understaffing. There was so little oversight in my new role, my lack of action went totally unknown. I kept telling myself, “I’ll catch up tomorrow, I’ll catch up this week”. But I became avoidant, spiraled, and it all snowballed. I mean, some things I let go for *months*. Pile on multiple health scares and being sick for months at a time, I truly felt I was drowning. I worked with a counselor all year and she advised that I was in shutdown and needed to give my brain time to heal, and to step away from this job when I could. So I finally did, but didn’t end up cleaning up my messes. 

So now all I can think about is the absolute disgust my coworkers must be feeling. The annoyance, the hate. The “holy shit she wasn’t doing this??” The backtracking they’ll have to do with some customers to make up for my inaction. The waves that will go through the company displaying my fuck-ups. 

I’m so ashamed I let it get to this, I can’t sleep. It’s 5am and all I can feel is intense embarrassment and shame. My parents were always the type to work themselves to death, and would be horrified if they knew what I did. I know it’s just a job, but I truly feel like a failure and a bad person. Maybe I am? I don’t know mom, I just need help navigating this. :(

Edit — I was finally able to get a bit of sleep and was really surprised to wake up and see this got so many comments. I’m still in the midst of all of the emotions and dealing with a nasty cold, so I’m struggling to have the space to respond to every individual person, but I’ll try soon! I just want to say I’m truly, sincerely amazed and touched by the responses and the support. My brain has been honestly struggling, even with my support system having my back, and having this outside assurance is more comforting than I can say. Thank you, internet mamas.

He has since apologized, he says he will do anything (no drinking, therapy, etc.) to get me to stay. 

This is the first time he has been physically abusive but not the first time he has been aggressive while drinking. I don't know what to do right now though. We have more than a week left in this vacation and I honestly am not in the best mood to go meet all his family for the first time. It just feels weird.

They are very nice and understanding but I just feel so icky about the whole thing and frankly wish I was home with my cats.

Update: Thank you guys so much - I haven't read everyone's comments yet because I'm not away from him. But I scheduled a flight in secret for tomorrow. He has been so fucking weird since it happened - I initially was like ""Blah I'll stay for him"" but things have already escalated and  this is not how I am going to live my life.

329,Just had a creep incounter with delivery man and i feel gross,"Hey i just need to tell this to someone.
So this afternoon i got a package where i've really been waiting for, a new lens for my camera. I accept the package and when i'm closing the door the delivery man sais the code didn't scan, so he tries a few more times, apologizing a lot. I say it's no problem, i get it whatever. Then he asks if he can use the toilet real quick. No problem. He comes back tries to scan it again doesn't work.. he texst his boss what he needs to do. He doesn't answer immediately so we make some small talk. He's also 22 like me idk just basic shit. 

I text my sister bcs i'm like this is weird. 

He explains that he cant leave the package so he will have to take it with him if he cant scan it. Lenses are expansive and the delivery service is not the most trust worthy so i'm scared if he takes it with him i'll never see it again. 

He stayed here for almost an hours. When he implite that he was getting horny i told him he should leave and take the box with him. 
The moment he got to is car he gets a ""text"" from a colleague how to fix the issue.

I realize now that there was probably never an issue and if there was he knew the solution long before he left. I feel stupid, so facking stupid. He wasn't making small talk, he was checking if other people where home, hoping i'll invite him in ( we were in the hallway). 

He knows my name and where i life, but i'm not scared. If he wanted to rape me, he could have so i don't think he would try that. 

I know it's not my fault, i didn't really invite him in but i still let him in the house. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. And i feel stupid for it and gross that he tried that. Idk why do people do this.

UPDATE: first of all: thank you for all the kind messages. It really helpt me to know i have support. 
I checked my toilet, no cameras. 
Checked my socials, no new followers.
I contacted the company to ask how i go about putting in a complaint. They haven't answered yet, i hope i can send an email otherwise there fbmessenger wil have to do. 
I did already type out the what i will send them. I tell them what happend, what inappropriate comments he made, that when i showed him the door he could suddenly scan. I also say how it made me feel ( anyone have something better than ""very uncomfortable""?) And that i will contact the police if he is ever infront of my house again, working for them or not.

UPDATE again just in case anyone is interested.
 I filled a complaint yesterday and woman of costumer service seemed just as grossed out as the rest of us. Today there was the most sketchy note in my mailbox. Written on the back of the list with packages to drop of today (probably breaking like 50 privacy laws). The note said it was from the local head of the delivery service and asked to call a number bcs they wanted more information. I will first contact the woman from costumer service again and will then decide if i call or not. If i call i'll put my nr on private. Also i don't think its from the delivery man bcs he didn't speak my native language good enough to have written this note.",z71hes,1098,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/z71hes/just_had_a_creep_incounter_with_delivery_man_and/

331,Update on my husband’s heart attack,"Last night my husband woke up at 3 am, and the very first thing he said after getting his breath tube removed was, “this is a terrible place for a first date.” To which I was supposed to say, “wait, this is a date?” and recreate the conversation we had ten years ago on our first date, which has become a running joke anytime we don’t want to be somewhere. Instead I just burst into tears and full on sobbed. It all just caught up with me. I had spent the hours watching him sleep and being terrified that he wouldn’t wake up. Or if he did, he wouldn’t be my husband anymore. 

And he still is. 

And then he proceeded to try to get out of bed to comfort me and I stopped feeling so mushy and remembered I’m married to a man who is allergic to rest and relaxation. Last year he tried to convince me that jogging would help his COVID. Man couldn’t stand without coughing, thought he could go running. Idiot. And today he has tried to get out of bed repeatedly, while covered in tubes and wires and still complaining that he felt like he’s been run over by an elephant. 

So yeah, still David. Just David with a heart condition now. 

And now on to that. And I apologize if I get some of this wrong, honestly bio was my worst subject, I’m very tired and overwhelmed, and also there has been some back and forth from the doctors on exactly what happened, but here’s what they’ve settled on for now: David definitely had a preexisting heart defect, and has since birth that left tiny holes in the valves of his heart. We have no idea why it didn’t effect him for so long, but it just didn’t. They suspect our getting COVID last year left him vulnerable to the infection that decided to attack his heart now, but they can’t be sure. That’s a sentence we’ve heard a lot from them. I don’t know how bad the damage has gotten because of this infection. There’s still some debate on if he actually had a heart attack or just experienced heart failure, but he was definitely in heart failure by the time he got to the hospital yesterday. He got two valves in his heart replaced in an emergency surgery. 

The one thing they can seem to agree on consistently is how lucky we are. That he collapsed before it just escalating to total heart failure and we were able to get him care. That I knew CPR. That my father in law called an ambulance so quickly. That my husband is a healthy, fit man in his thirties and got through surgery so easily. That there wasn’t more damage elsewhere. That he didn’t have a stroke, or hit his head when he collapsed. 

My husband is going to have to be taking a strict regiment of medication for the rest of his life. He will have to be incredibly careful about getting blood work done regularly, watching his diet and exercise and watching for any symptoms of heart failure. They have warned us there is a good chance he will have to get the new valves replaced in the future. But he doesn’t need a transplant. Recovery from open heart surgery is going to take time, but he’s going to be okay. 

I knew he was going to be fine the second he started complaining about being in bed. God help my sanity while he recovers from this. I think I might need the prayers more than he will. Especially since when I threatened to physically tie him to the bed to force him to relax, he took that as an opening to start flirting. While the nurse was still there. He literally had his chest opened yesterday. I have no idea what his end game was there. 

My in laws brought the kids for lunch. My mother in law looks exhausted, but so happy to see David up and talking and joking and complaining. My father in law looks like a shell of himself, which is what happens after 24 hours with my twins. The kids were delighted to see Daddy, even if they couldn’t hug him because his chest hurt. To those who reminded me how resilient kids are, thank you. My son talked for several minutes about how the firemen ran the siren for him after the ambulance left. Which means I think I need to send a gift basket of some kind to our local fire station. My daughters seemed more interested in everything in the room that beeped and looked breakable than my husband, to be honest. I don’t think Jane or I even let their feet touch the floor while in the hospital. They are chaos monsters who leave a path of destruction behind them. At least that’s how our former babysitter described them when she quit. 

As I was advised by the amazing mothers here, I made some calls yesterday and today. David’s best friend and our children’s godfather is flying in tonight to help out for the next couple days. When I called one of the moms in my son’s kindergarten class who has helped with childcare for my son in the past, she jumped into action like I didn’t expect. My son now has rides to and from school for when he goes back, and my mother in law reported that food has started to show up. She’s also coming over this afternoon to give my in laws a much needed break. Both of our jobs have been hugely understanding, and we’ve both been placed on emergency leave. 

I can’t thank this sub enough. When I first posted, it was because I was frantic and terrified and I didn’t know what to do. It felt like my world was ending and I didn’t know how to keep my feet on the ground. Every notification and kind word was a distraction from the hell I was in. My husband is the one who stays cool in emergencies. I panic and he takes action. He’s the one who reminds me that we’re a team and it’s us against the situation and we can handle it. Yesterday my team almost ended and I didn’t know what to do. It’s hard to not obsess over what could have happened. What if my ridiculously overprotective husband hadn’t insisted we take a CPR course? What if I had gone into the office instead of working from home yesterday? What if my son hadn’t had a cold that forced him to stay home from school, allowing him to be in David’s office at the right time and place? What if I had actually gone grocery shopping like I said I was going to, instead of procrastinating and hoping my husband would just do it instead? So many things had to happen for everyone to be where they needed to be. It just one thing was different, I could be planning my husband’s funeral instead of listening to him complain about being bed rest. 

So that’s where we are right now. Still in the ICU, but they think he can moved to a regular room by tomorrow. They think he’ll be here for about a week. David is trying to convince to me go home to sleep tonight, get some time with the kids. He has already completely won over the nurses who now adore him. His parents brought his laptop, and so I’m trying to convince him to find a show to watch instead of trying to get out of bed like everything is fine. And I’m just... here. Trying not to spiral. Trying to not stress him out by dumping this on him while he’s recovering himself. Trying to figure out the last 24 hours and put them into a manageable context. I don’t know how long that’s going to take, or if I’m ever really going to be okay with what just happened. But he’s awake, and still him and that’s what matters.",txxrs4,1096,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/txxrs4/update_on_my_husbands_heart_attack/

336,I'm reporting my abuser who happens to be my mothers second husband..,"I've already reported it, but pretty soon they're going to be contacting my mother because she was apparently a witness to the incident.. she's never been supportive, she's denied, lied, and never once has she tried to hold him accountable! I have so much pain inside me because she was supposed to protect me! She chose him time and time again!! Yet I'm wracked with guilt over how this will affect her!! I want to scream and scream til I lose my voice because of how hurt I am due to the actions of ""grownups"" around me!! I have so much pain, mom.. I just wanted to be loved and accepted by her but I was never enough.. I tried so hard to reconcile after the incident because my counselor told me ""everyone needs their mother"", but why was it up to a kid to move out because her living situation was no longer safe, why was it upto a kid to try build a relationship with her mother again, and why is it that the same kid is feeling guilty for finally wanting to seek justice?! 

Mother has also painted me out to be a liar, she told her side of the family that she doesn't think it actually happened? That I could've just made it all up! When I first told her about the incident she said I'd probably provoked him and deserved what I got!! Who says that to her own daughter? 

I apologize for this distressing vent, I don't know how to express all of this to people in my life and somehow it's easier to type it out instead! 

Am I doing the right thing? She's been sick for awhile and I will blame myself forever if this case takes a toll on her health.. but people have been telling me that I shouldn't be caring what she feels because she never did!!

cannot thank you enough for giving me the push that i needed to quit my current job! 

me and my partner both agreed it was best for me to go back to teaching. teaching children made me the happiest and we were also much more financially stable when i was doing it full-time. 

i posted my teacher resume online earlier this week, thinking nothing of it. within the past week, i have received three different job offers that are offering to pay wayyy more than i make now! 
and all three schools offer healthcare plans or FSA! i also woke up this morning to multiple requests for interviews! 

mom, i kept talking myself out of going back to education after a two year break because i didn’t think anyone would want to hire me with a huge gap in my resume. 

turns out, that was just my imposter syndrome rearing its ugly head.
one recruiter even messaged me that my resume was “impressive”.😭

i have an interview next week that i feel really good about (and nervous!) but i am already thinking about what my new students will look like, how to decorate my classroom etc.

341,Hi mom. I'm not graduating on time anymore. [UPDATE],"Original Post: [[here].](https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/u81z24/hi_mom_im_not_graduating_on_time_anymore/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Hi mom. I just wanted to update since you were worried. I've been talking back and forth with my professor and the chair of the department on what to do, per a lot of your suggestion and advise. I guess he didn't realize that it was my last semester and this was the only thing preventing me from graduating on time. He also didn't realize my financial aid would not cover any additional classes I'd have to take outside of the 4 years and would cost significantly more than if it were in banded tuition, since it's only one summer class I'd need. It is a little frustrating since I told him that in the beginning, but after talking with me and the chair, he opened up the exam with the condition he takes 10% off for being late. I agreed to this.

I took the exam and scored an 80%, which is now a 70%. This means I am on track to pass the class and ultimately graduate in 2 weeks! Commencement is May 11, and I wish you could be there for it. :)

Not only that, shortly after that sorted out, I got an email notification that my tuition balance was completely paid for! That's $6000 that was covered by a stranger. I think it's unrelated, but it makes me really happy because I can get my diploma as soon as I graduate instead of as soon as I pay the remaining balance of my tuition.

Thank you for the advise, mom. Thank you for just listening as well. It really helped clear my head and give me a path to pursue to get it sorted out.",ud5y3c,1069,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/ud5y3c/hi_mom_im_not_graduating_on_time_anymore_update/

350,"Mom, please wish me luck and send good vibes, I'm terrified. Today, I just might be getting accepted into a full ride nursing program. Mom, today, I might be becoming a nurse. I'm so scared.","Mom, please forgive me for this long vent, but I'm flipping out here and I need some good vibes or something. 

You know how much I've struggled. Endometriosis has stolen my life over the last few years and I've been clawing back, grasping at straws, doing the impossible to get myself back on my feet. 

After what I've gone through, the hundreds of hospital visits, stays, procedures, surgeries, fecken EVERYTHING that was so incredibly difficult and painful, I've been considering, maybe one day, I could get into nursing, so dear god in heaven, maybe I can ease at least ONE girls suffering on this earth, somehow, it would make it a worthy life mission to me. 

So I've been asking around, getting some info, while working on my health, actually having less flairs, meds seem to be working okay...and lo and behold, I got the most incredible offer. A full, apprenticeship-style ride (would be about 40/60 classroom time at uni and actual work at the hospital), absolutely FULLY paid for, from wages to tuition to living allowance. It's more than exactly what I asked for, it's the most incredible offer I've yet to receive. I have some health care training from the past, so all combined together, if I complete this program, I will end up with my LPN. But not only that, a door wide open for me to bridge into registered nursing in the future, and if we wanna dream REAL big - the hours and the various experience needed to maybe, someday, when I really grow up, become a nurse practitioner. 

My interview is in about 5 hours. I spent most of the day yesterday reading up about the particular hospital I'll be working at, looking up practice questions, etc. This is interview 2 out of 3, the in-person, make or break one. Mom, I'm absolutely terrified. I haven't worked in a few years, beyond few part time projects from home, not the same as on the floor in scrubs for 12 hours. Am I strong enough? Am I even worthy of such an incredible opportunity? Who am I to have decided, I have it in me to comfort people at their lowest and most vulnerable? What if I fuck the whole thing up? 

Mom, I think I need you to hold your fingers crossed, light a candle to whomever you pray and maybe do some sort of ritual good luck dance, I don't know, I'm flipping out here. 

Today COULD just be the day I take the first step in the direction of the honorable title of a Nurse. 

Dear God, Buddha, Allah, Satan, Universe, Flying Spaghetti Monster, literally whatever is out there, please please please don't let this slip by me. Please just for once, let me have something good. I genuinely want to help SO BAD, our system is so fucking broken and sure, I won't have the power to fix it, but maybe I could just make someone feel a little better, when they are at their sickest, just like some angels of nurses have done for me. God knows I wanna help and give back, whatever is out there, please let me. 

Ok, vent over. I'm off to breathe, drink some chamomile and go over my practice questions for the 37th time. 

Wish me luck y'all, pretty please. I will update as soon as I'm back, as the decision will be made by the hospital at the end of the day.

**********UPDATE: 

I am so sorry to have kept y'all waiting, but I've only just now received a reply, just a little over an hour ago,

I. GOT. THE. SPOT. I have been fully accepted, short of a few documents that I will need to provide in the next week, just very standard stuff, (first aid, references, criminal record check and such.) But I got it. I got in. I will be hitting the floor running in scrubs most likely the first week of December, if not even a little sooner. 

Dearest Moms and sibs, I absolutely am at a loss of words to express my gratitude for your prayers, kind words and well wishes. I'm sorry if I don't reply to any one particular or a bunch of comments, I am sobbing with happiness that overwhelms me. I have never been this cheered on, especially by a group Ive never mer before. I was SO nervous, I swear to god I didnt exhale properly since the interview, and until the email of acceptance came in. There are simply no words to describe how much you all boosted my confidence and made me believe that this actually might be possible. I am forever grateful to each and every one of you, for every kind word and thought. 

Because currently, I'm wiping happy tears, my heart is absolutely bursting from every kind word below. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU. It's with your encouragement that I SO needed that day, I got this opportunity in my pocket now.

369,"Mum, I don’t know how to deal with the embarrassment and shame of what I did last weekend","Hey mum.
Two weekends ago, I got so blackout drunk to the point where I was kicked out of a nightclub and sat outside on the steps completely vulnerable (luckily the owner and bouncer were really helpful in getting my friends and making sure I got home okay). For the last week, I have been feeling huge shame and embarrassment over what happened, and I feel like I hit rock bottom. Which is a new low for me. 

Anyway, last night I went out with friends (I stayed completely sober the whole time) and I walked past the bouncers who saw me the weekend before. They explained to me what happened, as I was trying to piece together the events leading up to it. They explained that I was struggling to walk at one point and was sick a lot. I honestly felt so ashamed and so bad of myself and I deeply apologised to the owner (which he was grateful for). I think a massive driver for what caused last week was that I deeply hate my job (I work night shifts for a supermarket and I’m struggling to get out).. And since it had been a stressful last few weeks, I used it as an outlet and had so many strong shots and strong drinks to forget. 

I don’t know how to deal deal with regret, shame and embarrassment. I’ve not ever done anything like that before. I’m struggling a lot and could do with some pep talk/advice.

She knows I’m in school full time and working part time and paying for everything on my own but I don’t know how to tell her I not only can’t be her maid of honor but I can’t afford to go to the wedding as well. I feel absolutely terrible and want to go but it really isn’t working out. I’m scared she’s going to hate me. 

I thought about throwing her a party when she gets back but idk. I’m just feeling awful and lost and embarrassed.

374,"Mom, my boyfriend ended things because I’m pregnant","I thought he was the one. We talked about marriage. He was kind, supportive, and made me grow as a person. I got the positive pregnancy test last night and he’s a whole different person now. I feel broken and alone.


(Copied from comments) EDIT: Hi moms, granny, & sis! Your words have been the only thing keeping me from crying all day. You’re right. I don’t need him. He reached out and wants to talk tonight but he isn’t allowed back into my life fully until he can prove he’s the secure, dependable person he was a few days ago. I’m ready to do this on my own if i need to. I’ll make another update after we talk.

EDIT 2: We talked last night and he doesn’t want to break up but he doesn’t want a baby. Apparently his ex pastor (he left the Evangelical church back in December) told him that if he left the church then he would “get some girl pregnant.” And he doesn’t want his pastor to be right. His family and friends are still deep in the church and very into the whole purity culture thing. He’s worried he’ll be judged. I was colder than I would’ve liked but I’m trying to protect myself. He left without us having a definitive plan. I can’t make such a huge decision this fast. 

This morning he sent me this message: “I've been thinking a lot on my ride to work. I haven't been reliable for you lately and I am so sorry for the way that I've been. You're my entire world and I don't want to live without you. I've resolved that I want to be more responsible and take more accountability. I still think it's unwise to keep this baby but I'm going to support your decision no matter what because I love you”

I want to believe him but I’m trying to be smart about this.",wyh27a,997,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/wyh27a/mom_my_boyfriend_ended_things_because_im_pregnant/

In May of 2022, I found out I have the pathogenic BRCA 2 marker. I met with an oncologist in June to discuss preventative measures. Three days later I woke up in a pool of blood. The uterine fibroids were so big, it was like I was four months pregnant. I had a month to prepare for the hysterectomy that was medically necessary. I finally felt 95% healed from that, when I fell and hurt my arm. I started physical therapy yesterday. Today, I was stung by a great black wasp. Im allergic. I just spent four hours in the hospital.

She's supported and believed me when I've told her about it. She's made effort before to have a relationship with me that doesn't involve my parents.

So when she invited me to Christmas and told me the guest list, I thought my parents wouldn't be there and accepted. But then as we are excitedly talking about the big day, she mentions all these other people being there, so I ask if my parents are coming and she says yes.

She said, ""oh I hope that doesn't change your decision to come, I really want to see you"". 

And I just feel so unheard. No apology or anything. No acknowledgement of my past boundary of me not being in any space with my parents.

So I cancelled in the kindest and politest way possible, reiterating my boundary. 

I just feel very sad. I wanted to see her and my cousins and siblings. But I would put my health at risk by going, and i refuse to put myself in a situation where I might harm myself.

I have been living with rose-colored glasses. 
My mother, father, and sister abused me severely growing up. I am 30 now, but I have an inability to feel love.
My therapist has explained that because of the environment I grew up in, I have cognitive distortions that play into my mental filter. Any mistake made at work or home no matter what, is my fault. I walk on eggshells with any one, even strangers on the street, because Im hyperaware of any hurt thats going to come my way. 

When my husband tells me he loves me, i have to break it down like a college essay, because love for me is the most foreign language. I have to tell myself and explain to myself why i am worth love as an adult. 

My heart has been breaking more and more for the child that never received nurturing. My family is still all alive and well but they are all narcissists for which i am still very much their daughter/sister who is there to be a punching bag, even though i moved across the country. 

I just need a mom right now.

Edit-
Thank you all so much for the loving words of encouragement, it is more than anyone in my family could ever offer me

I'm in my early 30s and I ended up getting pregnant with my longtime Fiance. We always thought we would be child-free so this was pretty crazy, considering we thought I might not be able to have children. We spent a lot of time talking about keeping it versus not. Lots of sleepless nights, worrying at all hours of the day of what is the most sound decision and having anxiety about what my friends and family would think about both scenarios. It was very emotional and confusing. (My Fiance was very supportive of me and said he would ultimately respect any decision I had and support me fully. He is absolutely lovey and I'm very happy to have him.)

We booked an appointment at PP in case I changed my mind, which I ended up cancelling. We both decided that even though now isn't the best time to have a child for us ( we spent 30k on needed updates on the house) we would still go with the pregnancy. This was over the course of 2 weeks and I feel so emotionally and mentally drained.

We decided to keep it private until Thanksgiving so we could announce it to both our families. By that time I should be heading into my 2nd Trimester.

I booked an OB/GYN appointments myself and an Ultrasound appointment. I have a dislike of going to the Doctors because of bad experiences with them, so I felt very confident and happy that I am pushing myself to do something for the health of myself and the baby.

\-------------------

At this point I should be about 9 weeks. The Ultrasound Doctor ( a separate office because the Tech at the other clinic is on maternity leave) came in and said that the gestational sac made it into my uterus but its progression is that of 5-6 weeks. The time table is way off.  The location is very close to the left Fallopian and so they are concerned. 

My OB/GYN called the very next morning and moved my first appointment to 2 days from then. They redid the Vaginal ultrasound, added an abdominal ultrasound, urine test, and a pap smear. They determined that it is a possible Cornaul Ectopic pregnancy ( where the fertilized egg implants near the Cornaul/opening of the Fallopian tube.) My doctor told me it is probably best not to let family and friends know of the pregnancy yet just in case. I've been at the doctor for 2 hours now. She says there is a lot of healthy tissue around the gestational sac so she feels positive about it but wants to monitor the situation. Everything is happening very quickly. I try to ask questions but I feel like my brain is overwhelmed.

 I never suspected that something was wrong. I've had no problems with strong smell, foods, taste, no cramping, no bleeding or anything other than tender breasts.

As I check-out, another doctor introduces herself and tells me she is also looking into my pregnancy and working with the OB/GYN I just saw. I feel extremely uneasy because I don't know the seriousness of this ectopic pregnancy and it feels scary.

\----------------------

Right now I was advised to take two Hcg blood tests that need to be 48hours apart. I mentioned to the second doctor that there is a huge snowstorm that might interfere with the tests and she said as long as I got the first blood test that day, that the second one would be okay by the next available day.

I did my first blood test immediately after the appointment. The winter storm tore through and everything is closed so I am forced to get the second on Monday, which I scheduled.

\-----------------------

After googling the diagnosis, I'm so afraid. I never cared about having children before, so I never bothered to look into pregnancies and birth,  but it is so much more dangerous than I have ever imagined. So many things can go wrong, and that's with ""normal"" pregnancies. Now its saying the only way to help an ectopic pregnancy is to evacuate it through medicine and the medicine seems so toxic and dangerous. The second option is to go through medical surgery where I have to be out of work for 4-6weeks, which I just cannot do. I'm not really sure why I'm writing all this but its so hard to keep this to myself and think about it all day in my head. I feel overwhelmed. 

I appreciate anyone that has bothered to read this very long post, Thank you.",yzsrvz,958,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/yzsrvz/mom_i_got_pregnant_and_found_out_its_ectopic_and/
393,I need a mom. I need a hug.,"My mom (64) died in 2021 in my arms from a brain embolism, complications from her pancreatic cancer. That led me (41) to get genetic testing. I have the pathogenic brca2 marker. I meet with an oncologist in June and we come up with a plan. Four days later I wake up in a pool of blood and my obgyn gets me in for an emergency ultrasound where they found uterine fibroids so large it was the size of a four month fetus. I had an emergency hysterectomy in august and they took everything. I started HRT. About six weeks post op, I fell and hurt my arm. Turns out, I have a partial tear in my rotator cuff. Today, I go to Smilow Cancer Center for my mammogram and ultrasound. And I know when the tech goes back to do more imaging of my right breast that something isn’t right. She goes and talks to the doctor before my ultrasound. The ultrasound tech spent quadruple the time on my right boob than left and then told me to hang tight while she went to speak with the oncologist. Then they brought me to a private room. They found shadows in my right breast. With my family history, there’s a 95% chance it’s cancer. I find out next week when they do the biopsies. I need my mom so badly right now. She knows what to say. She knows what to do. She would help with my care. Fuck, I just want her to give me a hug.

395,Sometimes a mom comes out of nowhere.,"This is cool, not seeking support or anything, just wanted to share a neat, uplifting story.

So I write fantasy.  My birth mother reads fantasy, loves it in fact. When I first published, I gave her a copy of the book.  She threw it away without reading it because it couldn't possibly be good enough. That stung for a while,  but I got over it and moved on. 

Fast forward years later, and I start the process of republishing, a (hopefully!) better way.  I get a professional cover, a new publisher, and get everything squared away.  A friend of mine from the Navy decides she is super supportive of the re-release, and buys 20 copies to send to random nerdy celebrities in the hopes that they might mention it to their fans and turn me into a big deal (as opposed to the guy who made $2.56 last year in book sales).

Now, to clarify, this friend introduced me to her parents, years ago.  Her parents took a liking to me very swiftly, even though we only spent a few hours together.  This was about 9 years ago.

Fast forward to today.  My friends 20 book order shows up.  Her mother happened to stop by, and see the stack of all the same book.  She asked about it.  My friend told her that it was my book.

She grabbed a copy and left.  Hours later, my friend finds her at a bar.  She is reading the book out loud to anyone who will listen.

That's crazy freaking support.  She met me for a few hours, 9 years ago, and is reading my words like some sort of prophet.  I don't even know what to do with this, but I'm freaking glowing.

Just remember, those of you whose birth mothers, like mine, aren't terrific (or even good), chosen mothers (and sometimes mothers you just kind of grew on, without choosing them!) can be an amazing replacement.

399,I passed my PhD qualifying exams!,"I'm honestly still in shock. I wrote my written exams from May 2nd-June 2nd (I had 4 questions I had to answer, and each response had to be 20 pages so I read, researched, and wrote 80 pages in a month) and then, yesterday, I had my oral exam. The oral exam was a 2 hour long questioning period - each of my examiners was given 20 minutes to question me in the first round, and then there was a second round of questions.

I spent so many days reviewing for 8 hours a day, agonizing over the questions, trying to work on my critical thinking skills, trying to memorize facts and figures, trying to make sure I was able to present myself as a worthy academic... I spent so many nights feeling doubt, like I wasn't good enough, like I was somehow faking my way through, like I didn't belong in my program. It has been so, so hard these last couple of months,

I had been practicing positive affirmations and mindfulness to bring my stress levels down and... the exam went better than I could have even have ever hoped. Ever dreamed, even. I still can't believe it's real. The examiners told me that I ""passed with flying colours"", that ""at points, we forgot who was the professor and who was the student"", and that ""when we had to discuss your weaknesses, there were crickets in the room"". Even just typing it out, I start to tear up. I never thought I could get to this point. I never thought people saw the value in my work, in my abilities. I never in a million years thought that **anyone,** let alone my PhD examiners, would give me that sort of positive feedback.

I am just so happy, so shocked, so relieved, so ... in disbelief.

She has tormented me so much that I've gone to the mental hospital twice in the last year. I have gone through periods of essentially being a single mom and the kids having three active parents. I've practically raised the kids myself, but I can't take the mental anguish any more.

Today we celebrate Christmas (we don't ever get them on actual Christmas) and it is so bittersweet. I'm not abandoning them... They can always call or text me. I have requested off work and cleared my schedule to attend my daughter's first band competition and will still go to games and performances for both my babies.

We will tell them tomorrow that I'm no longer going to be living with them or married to their daddy....

Mom! Please help me! What the fuck do I say!?

410,We lasted 6 months.,"Update: I’m trying to convince my dad to move here, but I don’t think it’s gonna happen and that’s it’s own story. My manager I’ve been following my whole time here is aware of the situation and helping me build a next step plan here, I love him so much and I should have listened to him a year ago. Doggy is doing okay, kitties are okay. He’s at work tonight, so I’m home alone and will likely be asleep when he gets back. I’m sorry moms, sisters, aunties, and everyone else supporting me but I’m staying through the lease with him for MY OWN financial reasons, not to benefit him. I have a dog now and we’re hitting fall so it’s cooling down so we can be out more and avoid him as much as possible. I played nice with someone meaner for a lot longer than I have to with him, I’m confident in myself that I will be safe. My parents know, my important friends know, and they’re all checking in on me frequently. I love you all, I appreciate your support, and I realize now that every time I’ve been too ashamed to talk to anyone about what’s happening, it’s because he should have been ashamed of what he is doing.

Hey mom, you know how I got married on 2.22.22? Yeah, well I'm ready to leave. I've been begging this whole time for more effort, whether it be a better job, general help around the house, hell even building a grocery list and I just can't do it anymore. You know how hard I've worked, and the positions I've put myself in to make sure we ***BOTH*** had a roof over our head and I'm just burnt out! I'm making $6 more/hr than I did when we moved out here December 2020, but he's earning less now and getting less hours. In fact, the month and a half he was unemployed he did nothing but tell me I needed to do more, he didn't help clean our home, take care of the cats, nothing. I cleaned our entire apartment this weekend, while I was sick, and he said NOTHING about it.

On top of that we decided to get a dog this weekend now that he's employed and bringing home reliable checks, something we have been discussing for months, and suddenly when it comes time he offers no help, in fact, he got mad at me for even asking because she is ""my dog."" Last night he offered to help her from under the bed so I could take her potty, but then sighed and started bitching at me for being on my phone. I wasn't even holding my phone and he was playing on his the whole time. I told him this upset me and he told me I'm a stupid bitch. He's never laid his hands on me, and we're both a little snappy I will admit, but I draw the line at name calling like this. I got in his face a la drill sergeant and told him he will speak to ***NOBODY*** that way, much less his wife.

Mom, I can't get out right now. Every penny I earn goes right to our bills with very little help from my husband. I just want you to know that physically I'm safe, but emotionally I need support. I'm so scared to talk to you, I finally became someone you can be proud of after 28 years and you've made that pretty clear, I know you're going to lose your shit when you find out I got that stinkin dog, but I just need someone to tell me its going to be okay. We have had this dog for ONE DAY and he is showing me he will never be an adequate partner to parent with, but I only ever wanted to be a parent with him. I'm just so scared and lost...

ETA: I just want to cover a couple of bases here. Our finances are separate. The only things legally linking us are our marriage and our lease. On the topic of the lease: I called and asked what my options are, explained husband has a history of DV (incident where he was protecting his ex from his brother but he threw the first punch, he's NEVER raised a hand to me) and that I need to get out while I'm still safe. I have four options: stay, pay 2x the rent to break lease, provide legal documentation saying he isn't safe and their attorneys will decide how much of the early break fee they'd waive  (I'd have to get hurt for this), or ruin my credit and abandon everything to go home since he can't afford this place.

I know that keeping the dog isn't a good idea right now, but I've been wanting a dog for yearssssss and I've been looking for ***THIS*** dog. I chose her for her personality, demeanor, behavior, size, look, everything. I suffer from severe anxiety (if you couldn't tell) and I planned on training her for service dog work. Being at the shelter was terrible for her, as bad as being in this toxic home is, and she would frequently get sick from the stress I just CAN'T take her back. She's already doing a lot better and she's going to be such a good girl when I get her out!

I did talk to my mom and dad, they're helping me build a plan. I'm pretty torn on staying here, or moving back across the country to be back home. I hated it back home, but I'm scared to stay out here alone even though I love it here.

Edit 2: he pushed me. He was mad about ants and threw my grandma’s vintage sewing machine on its side and ruined it. The parts are impossible to find and it was rattling when I picked it up. Took it out to the trash and cried, yet another sentimental hand me down, gone to his anger. He followed me, berating me for being dramatic that he just ruined $3,500 of family heirloom and told me I should have given it to his friends GF anyway because I’m worthless. I told him to stop speaking to me like that and he pushed me, making me trip over the gas line and banging myself up along my shin. At that point, as wrong as I know it was, I snapped and started shoving him back telling him to GTFO. Neighbors had to come by and tell him to leave as he was destroying my stuff while “packing.” He says he’s moving “back to the streets” and left, but I’ll be contacting the leasing office again.",x0vqop,901,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/x0vqop/we_lasted_6_months/

413,My drink got spiked and I'm having a hard time processing it,"I'm 20F and I went to a party with a few of my friends on Friday. When we go to these thing I always make sure that I pour my own drinks. I always stay close to my friends, I never leave my drink unattended and I never accept drinks from anyone. I know my limits and I never drink to the point where I can't control myself. I also went with people that I trust. 

We were there for about an hour. I was on my third drink when I started feeling weird. I knew that I wasn't drunk and I could tell that something was wrong. I began to feel sleepy, I felt dizzy, I was experiencing mental confusion and I just felt so out of it. I told my friends that something was wrong. I told them that I think my drink was spiked. They took care of me and they got me into the car.  That's the last thing I remember. According to my friends I was sweating a lot and I was going in and out of consciousness. 

I woke up the next morning in my friend's apartment with my boyfriend right next to me. I have no idea how I got there. The last thing I remember was my friends getting me into the car. I was in the same clothes that I was in from the night before. Usually when I'm out I text my boyfriend when I get there and I also text him when I'm home so that he knows I'm safe. He also does the same. He was out with his friends and he texted me when he got home. It was around 1 in the morning and I didn't respond to him or text him to tell him that I was home which was strange. I'm usually home by that time and I always let him know if I'm staying out later so that he wouldn't worry that something bad happened to me. 

He called me a few times but I didn't respond. He got really worried so he called my friend that I was with. She told him what happened and that I was at her apartment and that I was safe. I don't think he slept that entire night. He came over to my friends apartment later that morning and he stayed with me until I woke up. 

I woke up feeling awful. I was so sick and I felt really weak. My stomach was hurting a lot, I was sweating and I threw up so much to the point where I was only throwing up bile because I didn't have anything left in my stomach. I was like that all day yesterday. My boyfriend was really sweet and he took care of me. I'm feeling a lot better today but I'm still very shaken up by what happened. It's so scary. It could have been a lot worse. I had my drink with me at all times and I have no idea how it could have gotten spiked. I'm having a hard time processing what happened. I probably won't be going out any time soon.",v5di8m,893,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/v5di8m/my_drink_got_spiked_and_im_having_a_hard_time/
414,I really need a perspective from an older woman,"Hello, I'm currently 26 and feel really bad about my age. I feel like I aged out on all my goals and aspiration and need to settle. 

When I was 16 my dad told me essentially I was too old for my dreams on dancing and I felt really bad and stopped. At 25 I got back into it and try not to think too much about it. 

What gets me is now I'm 26 and pursuing medicine. My dad sat down and told me that I'm just too old and that I'm wasting away my 20s and will have nothing to show for my 30s. Its hard not to feel insecure when youre aborad studying another language instead of raking in more moeny. I feel insecure and bad about even attempting this. I am probably going to have to reapply and start medicine at 28 if it works in my favor. 

Older women of this sub, is this true? I see people like Megan R who is 35 and playing soccer and think it can't be, she's 35 and doing amazing! Why can't I then dance? Its just hard when it comes to your parents, their words really cut deep.


Edit: wow thank you for all the wonderful replies! I honestly have a changed perspective now. I think my dad is extremely sexist and stuck in his ways. I'm going to just keep my thoughts to myself and push for what I want. It's hard not to when you're enjoying the moments of that goal.

I just feel like a failure to myself, and I’m the oldest son. There’s a responsibility in that.

421,"Mom, I don’t know what you would have wanted us to do for you in the end.","My mom passed away Thursday night. She was only 53, it was so unexpected. I was speaking with her Wednesday, she just got a new job and was asking me my ssn to set up her life insurance benefits. I gave her mg new address, valid after 10/22, and joked asking her to promise she has at leeaaassstttttt 2 more weeks in her. She promised. She told me about her birthday plans for 11/5. Karaoke bar with friends. She told me about her Halloween costume. She was so happy to be quitting a bad job. 

Now I’m just lost. We never spoke about final wishes. I know she was a wild lady and I’m sure whiskey and rock n roll must be included. But we’re meeting at the funeral home tomorrow to plan everything. It’s so exhausting to even consider. Not only that but her two sisters, older and younger, are both enemies. They’ll be communicating through me. As they did through her. One sister goes through my moms house, the other changes the locks. I just don’t know how I’ll hold the peace. Everyone’s so hurt. We’re sad and it’s not time to be bitchy towards each other. 

I don’t know how to do this. I don’t want to this. I wanted to speak with my mom and apologize for being a monster teenager. For finally understanding all the trauma that shaped her and made her worry about me following in her footsteps. She never got a chance to leave the reactive survival mode part of life. She worked hard job after hard job. She was abused by men, these men abused me and my brother. Everything just feels so tragic. She never got to relax and live the good life. 

But god damn, she always tried to be happy. I only saw her cry maybe 3 times. She was a strong resilient woman. She just wanted to love and be loved.

But, I’ve been at my company for three and a half years and just had my annual evaluation. I’m an executive assistant to a CEO - super small tech company. I love my boss and my job a ton and am super grateful to be on his team. 

My boss raved about how much he appreciates me and how well I’m doing, and raved about some of my achievements. He gave me an almost 25% raise on my current salary, plus gave me an extremely sizeable Christmas bonus, AND bought me an iPhone 13 pro for Christmas because he heard me mention once that I really wanted one. 

It just felt really good being so appreciated and that he actively bumped my salary so much. He also told me that he pretty much wants to work together forever, so that was amazing too. ☺️

I don’t normally gloat about stuff but I am really proud of myself on this one, and I don’t have many friends to share with. 

I really wish my mom could support me in this.

The woman who raised me is not a part of my life right now. This was my choice, and most days I know it was the right one. But there are some days when I just want a mom who is loving and supportive to be there for me. Today is one of those days.

My husband and I adopted our dog 13 years ago. We were young and poor when our little guy joined our family and now we are older, less poor, and have added a human son. Our dog, Leo, was with us through three moves, four jobs (for me), graduate school, three years of infertility treatments, one very difficult pregnancy, and four very serious depressive episodes (for me).

He was my shadow, wherever I was, he was right there with me. We took walks together, read hundreds of books, and celebrated dozens of holidays (I even created a doggy Easter egg hunt for him one year). In some of my darkest days, my only motivation to get out of bed was to feed and walk Leo. He saved me in more ways than I can say.

My husband and I are both hurting today. I know saying goodbye now was the right decision. The cancer was everywhere in his not-so-little body and he was declining so quickly. I know this was best for him. But I hurt and my person - my husband - is hurting too and I want a mom to hold me, stroke my hair, and tell me I did right by my little buddy.",xp5917,859,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/xp5917/dear_moms_i_had_to_put_my_dog_of_13_years_to/

My dad molested me when I was younger. I’m not sure how many times, or how long it went on, but it stopped when I hit puberty. He still occasionally makes comments and looks me dead in the eye while making inappropriate jokes, so I’m not sure what to classify that as. I know it’s not ok. I never told any of my family but my partner and my friends know, and I am in therapy.

My parents are married and I have 3 brothers. My mom works on commission and my dad makes a lot of money, which is why this is so hard. It’s always hard, I know. I’m afraid if I say anything the entire family will be turned upside down and I won’t be able to be supported financially while I finish college. 

I visit home a lot and it’s hard. It’s so hard and there is so much grief in my chest as I write this. I don’t like seeing my dad but I miss my mom and brothers so much I can’t help but visit. 

Lately, I’ve been toying with the idea of telling my mom what happened. She’s asked me three times in the past if I was sexually assaulted and I denied it, so it makes me wonder if she already knows. I think that’s my worst fear. 

I think I need some hand holding right now. I don’t know if I can do it, but I want to. Mom, how should I go about this? What would you do in this situation? I’m doing so well with what I have and I don’t want to mess it all up.

435,"Husband is threatened by my ""success""","Hi Moms. 

I've been something of an unwilling SAHM for most of our relationship. It made more sense for me to stay home with our young kids, but it was never something I actively wanted. I don't particularly enjoy being here at the house all day, every day, watching terrible cartoons, cleaning, cooking and having said food snubbed by small people. Some women truly thrive in this environment, but I am not one of them. I'm lonely, incredibly bored and feel overall stifled. We're also not exactly flush with cash. We do okay, but we're definitely on a pretty firm budget. We had always agreed (I thought we agreed?) That I'd go back to work once kids were school aged. 

3 years ago, I decided to go back to college for a different degree so I would be qualified for the jobs I really wanted once youngest kiddo hit school age. I talked this over with my husband before pursuing it and I thought we were on the same page. He wasn't really interested in it, but I didn't really expect him to be overly fascinated by my schoolwork so I didn't think much about it?

Then the pandemic hit and I wound up back to work in a part-time job for extra cash. We needed the money and it was a night job so childcare was not an issue. My husband was very negative about the job from day 1. He made it very clear from day 1 that he didn't think I could do it. He constantly encouraged me to quit. He was annoyed when I was offered a permanent position. He never particularly liked my working there, but I assumed it had more to do with the nature of the job (warehouse) than that I was working. He continued encouraging me to quit and eventually put me in a position where I basically had no choice except to quit because he, the breadwinner, decided to take an out of state job that required we move. I wasn't given much of a vote in this (which has since been a HUGE issue in the marriage - never again will I allow myself to be in that position). 

Several months later we got into a big fight and he admitted that he didn't like needing my income and basically my working made him feel emasculated and like ""less of a man"". He said that was why he had to take new out of state job where he could make more. I was extremely hurt and angry. I would have much rather stayed in our previous state and continued to contribute to the household than move again so I could return to comfortably being a SAHM. I don't even WANT to be a SAHM. 

We had several long discussions about how my working doesn't mean I think less of him or his ability to provide. I want to work. I like having extra money. The kids like doing fun stuff. It's a win-win. I thought we'd made it onto the same general page. Especially since I was still working on my degree (I only had a semester left at the time all this came out) and he was fully aware of the progress I was making towards earning that degree. 

Well, I'm finishing it up and applying for jobs. Good jobs. Jobs that will basically double our household income. Guess who isn't happy? 

He's behaving like an absolute jackass. He couldn't be any less supportive. I doubt he'll even acknowledge my graduation. I landed a job interview for a great job, he told me I needed to take our 5 year old with me to the interview. No, I didn't even ask him to watch him. I had someone lined up. He didn't ask me if I had it taken care of, he just assumed I didn't and told me it was my problem. 

Apparently, all I am to this man is free childcare + a housekeeper. 

Our oldest kid mentioned last night that I've stopped talking to Dad. Not the silent treatment or anything dramatic like that, but I'm just no longer really having conversations with him or engaging with him. He's right. The man is so negative about everything I'm doing, I don't want to talk to him. It hurts my damn feelings when I do. 

Also, the last real conversation I had with him resulted in my telling him how disrespected I felt and him actively disrespecting me further by getting up and walking away from me mid-sentence because he had to poop. He literally just left me sitting there trying to pour my heart out and be honest so he could take a damn shit. He says that's acceptable. 

This morning he informed me he's considering abandoning the ""dream job"" he moved to this state for in pursuit of a better opportunity for himself..... I'm entirely certain this is because my own interview for a job making almost as much as his current one was literally yesterday and it went well. 

I want a divorce. I have no family, only child of dead parents. I have only a couple friends here. No real support system. He'll never let me take the kids back out of state. I'm fucking stuck here. If we didn't have the kids, I'd have left a year ago. 

He refuses to agree to a divorce. He says we're going to work it out and we'll be fine. He says he's sorry and will change. I don't believe a word of it other than he won't agree to the divorce, that, I believe. 

I am so miserable and brokenhearted. This was supposed to be such a huge accomplishment and he  has ruined every bit of it and made me second guess and regret every decision I make towards improving myself and my own future happiness. I want to have and give my kids the best life, and instead I get this toxic crap.

436,Hi mum. I was inspired by a beautiful redditors post about rehabilitating a wallaby Joey. I wanted to share some photos of rehabbing Kangaroos.,,tdk22q,837,14,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/tdk22q
437,hey mom! I noticed some fun things about my cats,"A while ago I rescued two kittens off the street. Only 6 weeks old and extremely weak.

The calico baby (Xena) was a runt and so  much lighter than her sister (Luci) who was already pretty underweight. I wasn't ever sure she'd make it. She was too tired to play or do much other than nap and eat. I gave them bathes and dewormers and kept warm shirts and blankets with them at all times. I checked on them and fed them every few hours. They were scared, not feral but they'd his and swat and hide from me. 

Now, 4 weeks later they act as if they never spent a day in their life on the streets. They're picky with food and love being cuddled and even follow me around. Now that they're healthy and happy here's some fun things I've noticed about them:

LUCI: 🐈

-Luci hates sponges and paper towels, not sure why but whenever I hold one or bring them out she does her little crab stance and tries to attack them, I think it's cute

-Luci gets jealous whenever I pet her sister and not her too

-She loves being wrapped in my shirt and carried around like a baby

-weirdly enough she actually likes water 

-She likes jumping on my back and just sitting there

-she likes watching videos on my phone and computer with me


XENA: 🐈+◻️+🐈‍⬛

-Xena likes sitting in my lap all the time. Anytime I sit down anywhere she chirps and runs over to plop in my lap and take a nap or clean herself

-Xena suckles on my finger like a baby whenever she's calm

-Xena surprisingly likes being pet on her stomach, she'll roll over when on my lap just for me to pet it

-She loves chicken and turkey but hates ocean fish flavor food and refuses to eat it lol

-she hates my phone, whenever she sees me on it she'll pounce on my hand and nibble at my phone

-when she meows instead of it being a normal meow she'll go ""me-o-o-ow"" 

-She loves being kissed, whenever I kiss her on the forehead she starts purring immediately 



I know it doesn't seem very important but these babies have kept me sane through my bad home life, I love them to death and they've saved me and I appreciate every little quirk and funny thing about them",x3imnr,840,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/x3imnr/hey_mom_i_noticed_some_fun_things_about_my_cats/

440,mothers yesterday i heard from my real mum,"i’m 18, when i was 15 one night my mum dropped me off at the hospital and left me there, she texted me the next day saying that she wasn’t gonna come back for me and that i have to find somewhere else to live but she hopes we’ll always have a relationship… i got really angry over text and then i never saw her again. yesterday she texted me again and she said: “*i know you said never to contact you again but if and when you’d like to contact me, you can at anytime. miss you and love you ❤️*”

i’m so confused because if she missed me… she should’ve considered that before she literally abandoned me. i hate this lady, i’ve hated her for years even before she left me, she’s so good by my little brother but she has always been neglectful to me and i have to live the rest of my life with irreparable trauma and mental illness in the form of borderline personality disorder because of how she did me my whole life. i don’t want her back and i don’t need her back. 

but i am having a really bad time these days and i want nothing more than a mother, just to sleep in her bed like a baby for a few hours is all that i want, but i know it won’t be like that, but i still have too much hope. even if she was going to want me like that, i’m too old to be babied by her in a way that i need to resolve all my issues, i know all of this deep down but that isn’t stopping me from wanting to respond to her like mummy i missed you so much please come back to me 

at this point my plan is to ignore the text entirely but i can’t shake it from my mind, if i don’t get sappy and baby on her then i might just respond really angrily and abuse her from my phone. i hate it so much why couldn’t she have just left me alone?

442,"Mom, my doctor isn't listening to me about being sober, so I fired him","I'm having panic attacks so bad they feel like heart attacks. Spent the morning in the behavioral health urgent care. I tell them my doctor keeps trying to prescribe benzos... Of which I am clean and sober from, for 6 years.  I've told my doctor this no less than 6 times.

The NP mentioned a drug that isn't habit forming that my doctor never even mentioned before. They want me to get it from him, though, but offered a full list of in network providers in case I don't get anywhere.

So I call him. He asks if I'm married... Again, like he does every visit... Then tells me he wants to prescribe benzos. Again. I have to remind him I'm sober from them. Again.

I just felt so defeated. It's like a bartender offering his alcoholic friend a whiskey sour, after being told repeatedly they're in AA. Best way I can't describe it. I declined. He called it in anyway. It took all my strength to tell the pharmacist to close the script and not fill it.

Started calling providers on that list I got and found a new doctor right away. This doctor doesn't even prescribe benzos or anything schedule 3, so no risk of temptation. Got an appointment with them next week. I'll never see my old doctor again. Here's hoping the next one is better.

They’re helping me so much.  Found out I was Rh negative and they’re even covering the extra cost for that.

I’m trying to think of the positive.  I get to start a new life here, make new friends, figure out who I am.  My ex can’t mess with me anymore and I know that for a fact.  He’s in jail and I’ll be notified before he gets out and that will probably be awhile.  Have an OOP.

I hope I don’t wind up regretting this decision, but I don’t feel anything telling me not to.  I thought I’d at least have some reservations.  My nightmares are just about being back in the home with my ex, being trapped and things like that.

445,My partner is in the hospital and I'm so scared,"My partner has been suffering from an ongoing headache and neck/shoulder pain for a few weeks. We figured it was leftover from Covid. Last night, when we were about to go to sleep, they suddenly felt very dizzy and unwell. They managed to get into the bathroom before the vomiting started. I soon called an ambulance. First the paramedics were of the opinion that it's just positional vertigo, but they were taken to a hospital nonetheless. I hitched a ride with them and waited in the lobby from 5.30 to almost 9 am.

Turns out it was vertebral artery dissection in both vertebral arteries (I'm not actually sure there's two, but the doctor was talking about both sides) and a small blood clot in one of them. They were immediately started on blood thinners and got a plethora of other meds too. They're stable, all limbs work, eyes work, speech works just fine. They're also on constant watch by the nurses for at least two days. We're not really sure of anything beyond that.

Me then? I've been weeping my eyes off all day. I have pre existing strong fears and traumas relating to losing people and sudden serious health problems - so this situation is activating my two absolute biggest fears and triggers. I'm so scared I'll lose my partner. I'm only allowed to visit for a short while a few times a day. I'm home now and I'm so scared to go to sleep.

My partner is my everything. We've been together almost half our lives - met at 15, been together for over 11 wonderful years now. They're absolutely my rock, my person, my best friend. I can't and don't even want to imagine a life without them. I also can't shake the feeling that they'll be taken away from me. I don't know what to do. I'm just so terrified.

EDIT 13 hours after posting:

From the bottom of my heart, thank you everyone for your comments, hugs, advice and all the support. I'm still quite tired so I probably can't answer all the commenters individually, but I've read everything and all of you have helped so much.

My partner is doing okay, they messaged me early in the morning all by themself so clearly doing a lot better. They slept good and are currently eating, so I'm waiting until they're done to go visit again. They feel pretty okay, just some neck stiffness right now. They're getting an MRI done today or tomorrow, we'll know more after that, but nonetheless they're being constantly monitored at least until tomorrow.

I'm also doing a bit better. I spoke to a psych nurse and a doctor yesterday and got meds for the anxiety and sleeping. Managed to sleep at least seven hours I think. I just ate breakfast and drank water, too. I'll edit this post again when we have some new info. Once again, thank you so much, everyone. You have no idea how much your words have helped me calm down. I'll pass the well wishes to my partner too.",x1s4ee,816,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/x1s4ee/my_partner_is_in_the_hospital_and_im_so_scared/

448,"[Update] Well mom, I 20F told the 37 year old guy that I was seeing that I don't want to date him anymore.","I made a post about about a week ago here asking if I should continue dating a 37 year old guy. I thought I'd make an update because I got a lot of comments on my last post and a lot of you were telling me to run. You guys really knocked some sense into me. I got some pretty good advice and after reading through all those comments I decided not to date him anymore. I originally made that post because I was conflicted on whether or not I should continue to date this guy and I don’t have any older adult in my life that I can go to for advice. Like I did like him but at the same time I felt like something was off. A lot of you told me that it was a bad idea based on past experiences you've had in relationships like these. These are some of the points you guys made that really helped me come to the conclusion to not date this guy anymore:

1. I mentioned this in my last post but I felt a lot of anxiety while I was on the date with him. A Lot of you told me that this was my intuition telling me something. I do actually struggle with anxiety and my brain can be pretty stupid at times. Like my anxiety can be pretty irrational. I often get told to stop overthinking and worrying so much. Sometimes I have a hard time deciphering whether that feeling is my anxiety or my intuition trying to tell me something. After thinking about it for a while I came to the conclusion that it was my intuition trying to tell me that something is off and a lot of the comments confirmed that.
2. A lot of you talked about the power imbalance that there would be if I were to continue dating this guy and eventually get into a relationship with him. That actually made a lot of sense. Honestly, I did feel a bit intimidated by his age but I kind of just ignored it.
3. Some of you mentioned the difference in life experience. That he has a lot more life experience than me and that he could use that to manipulate and control me. Which made a lot of sense. While I wouldn’t consider myself to be  immature, I definitely do not have as much life experience as a 37 year old. Now thinking about it, I think that also added to my anxiety.
4. Then someone asked me if I was ready to settle at this age. Someone asked if I thought about family planning, whether he’s looking for a SAHM, how he plans to save for retirement, does he have debt etc. Which was an eye opener because I didn’t know the answers to any of those questions and I felt overwhelmed by just thinking about it. I honestly have no idea what I’m doing in life.
5. Finally, a lot of you mentioned that him telling me that age is just a number and that I’m very mature for my age is a red flag. I didn’t think anything about it at first but so many of you in the comments mentioned that it is a common line that predators use and that it’s creepy. Then I realized that it actually is a weird thing to say. The I thought am I really that naive?

He texted me the day after I made that post asking if I had reconsidered my decision about going on the second date with him. I told him that we are both at different stages in our lives and that it would be best for us to remain friends. He was pretty cool and understanding about it. He said that it’s okay and that he understands and told me that he'll see me at the gym. I didn’t really expect him to react badly. We didn’t talk at all after that and I saw him at the gym a couple days after. He came up to me. We were having a normal conversation when he asked me if I could reconsider my decision. I told him no and that I think it’s best for us to remain friends. He looked frustrated and he just left.

Later that day he sent me a long message calling me every name in the book. He called me a slut. He told me that I was a horrible person and that I was just using him and that he never wants to see me again. Then he blocked me. I was a bit taken back by his message but I just ignored it and went about with my day. I guess he doesn’t handle rejection well. I haven’t seen or heard from him since then.

Well it turns out that you guys were right about this guy being bad news. I feel like I really dodged a bullet there. I’ll definitely try to listen to my intuition more. While I don’t think that age gap relationships are bad. I’ve actually seen some age gap relationships that worked out fine and there can be bad people at any age. I'll stick to dating people that are around my age for now. Thank you guys for the advice and support that I got on my last post. It helped a lot.

TLDR:  I told the 37 year old guy that I was seeing that I don’t want to date him anymore. I thought that he had taken it well but he asked me to reconsider my decision. When I said no he got upset and sent me a long message calling me a slut and every other name in the book then he blocked me. I haven't heard from him since and I really dodged a bullet there. Thank you for the advice that I got on my last post.",tymsld,819,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/tymsld/update_well_mom_i_20f_told_the_37_year_old_guy/

Alcohol just makes me feel so horrible. My friends have been pressuring me to drink on my 21st birthday eventhough I told them no multiple times.

456,Am I weird for finding comfort in different things when my adoptive Mom hugs me compared to my adoptive Dad?,"So I (18F) was adopted at 15 after years of abuse and neglect. 

When my Mom hugs me my head is over her shoulder and she tends to rub my back a bit and talk to me. So I take comfort in her voice more than anything.

When I hug my Dad he typically won’t say anything he will wrap one arm around my shoulders, the other loosely around my head, rest his cheek or chin on the top of my forehead, but the comfort in all that for me is that due to our height differences my head is on his chest and I can hear his heartbeat. That’s what calms me down with him is the sound of his heart.

I feel like I’m absolutely crazy for finding comfort/safety in his heartbeat instead of his voice or something like I do my Mom.

Is it normal to feel calm/safe when you hear the heartbeat of someone you love, specifically someone who’s become your parent?",yp95yg,788,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/yp95yg/am_i_weird_for_finding_comfort_in_different/
457,Today I found out my mother considers me a burden,"I spent my 27th birthday in the ICU due to some serious medical issues. My sister took me to brunch today as a gift, and told me about how when our mom goes to her house, she talks poorly of me and talks about how I am a burden. 

I have: 

Type 1 Diabetes 
PCOS 
Hepatic Adenomatosis 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
Migraines with aura 
Rumination Syndrome 
Gastroparesis 
Fibromyalgia 
hEDS 
HS 

There's more than that but just to give a small idea of what my medical situation is.

My mom couldn't get me from the hospital because she had a ""headache"". She always asks me to get things for her even though she is fully capable of going to the store on her own. 

I know this isn't a coherent post but... having your mother talk behind your back, consider you a burden AND try and take advantage of you all in one is a hard thing to deal with. 

I feel like I am always going to be a burden, if my own mother considers me one, why wouldn't anyone else?

I told my sister that my mom says things like, ""She should have waited to move out"" regarding my sister because I wanted her to know the truth. I don't believe my sister told me this to make me feel bad, I've always asked her to be honest with me regarding our parents because they are very toxic.

459,My boyfriend thinks I sleep too much.,"We have been together for a couple years now and have lived together most of that time. 

I generally get tired around 9pm, but try to stay up until at least 10. Most nights, I fall asleep on the couch before then though. I wake up at about 6 or 7 most mornings due to work and have a fairly physically demanding job. 

This has come up before in a few comments from him here and there, but this time seems different. He seems much more serious and I would border on saying he seems mad or frustrated about it. 

 I fell asleep at about 11 or 12 last night. This apparently was too early (and was during a movie that he was trying to show me) and he didn't even come to bed, he just slept on the couch. I woke up at about 7 this morning and was up and doing things by 8. He woke up at about 1130. We went to do some physical work that we needed to get done and I didn't sit down until about 4. I fell asleep for an hour. 

When I woke up, he was making comments about how I sleep all the time. Even when I tried to appreciate the work he had done today, he turned it into being about how I slept for one hour (even though I worked, going up and down stairs consistently for about 3 hours). 
It kind of even turned into an argument. And he has been grumpy to me since. 

At this point, I just feel depressed. I have a few health conditions that do take a bit of work to stay on top of and have spent most of my life sick. This also means that I am very aware of the state of my body, I know when I am getting sick or when I need something specific for my health. This includes when I need to sleep. I do think that I need more sleep than him, but he just doesn't seem to accept that as an answer. I'm at the point where I'm questioning why I'm even trying to stay healthy, since it seems that it's not good enough for him. 

I really just don't know what to do about it anymore and am starting to wonder if I really am sleeping too much and need to address it with my doctor. Mostly, I'm just sad that this is what seems to be the biggest road block in our relationship.

EDIT: this is sort of getting to the point that I can't answer all of the comments. I never expected to get this many. I have been doing my best to read all of them. 

I have come to a couple conclusions: 
1. The issue isn't about me sleeping or sleeping too much but that I fall asleep when we were supposed to be spending time with each other (e.g. watching a movie), therefore probably hurting his feelings and making him feel ignored. 
2. This is coming up at this time due to the stress we are under and that is also making it so he isn't communicating it in the best way. 
3. My boyfriend is not abusive, he's just expressing himself inappropriately and could do a better job of telling me what is really bothering him. 

My current plan is to do my best to communicate my energy levels at night to him and to stay awake if he wants to watch a movie together. The conversation about this can wait until we are not under so much stress and are both more clear headed to talk constructively. 

I don't think I'll be able to really answer many (if any) more comments. Especially with the work week starting and all the things we have to do outside of work this week. But I appreciate the time and thoughts that everyone has put into this. I really never expected to get so many comments and so many different points of view.

My friend has been diving me around the place a lot more recently after an incident with my mum. But now he keeps talking about having sex with me and I don’t know how to tell him no. Ik he doesn’t believe that I’m asexual or that I’m non-binary and Ik that’s why he’s doing this. 

I’m so lost. My friendships are all over the place and I feel like I have no one to talk to unless I’m helping someone or getting helped. Abs my mum has become a lot more controlling and over bearing witch makes it harder for me to see my dad or do anything really. 

I have all of this and I’m trying to do schoolwork and organise pride stuff and I love what I’m doing but I feel so alone and soo tried. I can’t even get out of bed and there just this mountain of work slowly crushing me further and further. Im so lost. Im so scared.

465,"Mom, I got a tattoo. It was not received well by my Nparents/stepparents","Life has been sucking to say the least. I got a tattoo yesterday and I felt so happy. Just this unexplainable happiness I felt like okay I did this, I can get my crap together. Be proactive. 

It’s a serpent reaching for the moon. It symbolises me shedding my old skin and embracing my emotions and feelings. It’s the one (of three) that I felt most connected to.

I told my mom first. Her reaction was “what is this, what have you done” her tone was forceful humour and I just brushed it off saying that I’m driving and that I’d call her later. We haven’t spoken since.

I told my dad and step mom today after much contemplation because i knew their reactions would be less than ideal. 

I FaceTimed pops he said he liked it. And I said okay gotta go. Then I shared a picture of it on the group I have with him and my step mom and she said is this for real. I cant believe it. 

Cut to 10 minutes later, my father is saying “you can get it removed right because when you get older (I’m 19) you’ll want to get it removed” 

To which I replied “I don’t appreciate this negativity, I told you happily, next time I won’t tell you anything”

He replied “hoping there won’t be a next time. That’s enough with the tattoos”


I don’t understand how much he can ruin an already fragile relationship. And the change of tone after my stepmom got involved. Unbelievable. 

I love what I got tattooed and I am so put off by their reactions. 

I could use a hug mom.

467,Hey Mom. I put out a fire last night.,"The outlet behind my bed caught fire. I didn't notice until the flames were higher than my bed. So I grabbed a towel, got it wet, and slung it at the fire like you see on TV. It worked.

I won't tell you about this. Dad either. You'd just say you're proud of me, and I'd feel like a dog being patted on the head. Or worse, you'd say of course I did. That you raised me to stay calm in a crisis. Like me doing something cool is because of you, or a reflection on your ""good"" parenting. It's not, and I don't want to hear it.

I put out a fire with flames as high as my waist. Alone. I am an actual fucking badass, and I want to be able to tell you about it without you making it about you or how you feel.",uzv9ql,769,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/uzv9ql/hey_mom_i_put_out_a_fire_last_night/
468,"Ma, look, I fixed up my apartment!","I woke up at 9 and fixed my bed today. I took a moment to admire the fairy lights I put up last night (I’ll send you a picture later!). 

When I got up, I made my favorite breakfast and washed the dishes, pots, and pans all by myself. I quite like doing it! If only the sink wasn’t so tiny.

After breakfast, I took my melatonin instead of my ritalin so I had to jump into the shower and FREEZE myself awake, haha! But now I feel so clean and fresh.

I swept the floors and took a walk around campus for a bit. I also got an excuse to call dad today because I needed his expertise on an assignment (I’m learning about the constitution and he taught constitutional law!). I have an appointment with my therapist at 4 and I’m so happy I have one.

Ma I feel so good about myself today I could cry. Just a year ago today I couldn’t find any reason to wake up in the morning, much less give a damn to clean up the messes I’d make. I was so depressed and heartbroken and neglected. My autism was treated like I was doing it on purpose and I wasn’t diagnosed with ADHD yet and getting the proper medication. But now I find that, as hard as it is to accept, there are people who love me, and I might just be capable of loving them back. I’m finding ways to cope with my disabilities and I think I’m doing pretty okay.

Sometimes I still feel resentment, bitterness, and anger towards the people in my life who abused me— Emotionally, physically, sexually— but I’ve found that I’ve been forgetting them more and more as I make space for new, brighter memories. I know I fall back into my sadness every now and then, and I have a lot of work to do towards my self-esteem, but I like this life I have and I’m sure I’ll start liking myself more and more eventually.

My professor sent me an email saying, ""You got a 98% on the final and your final grade is a 97%! I am not  exaggerating when I tell you this is the highest grade out of ALL of my  classes!!""

I made a joke saying I will go all Scarlet Witch on this exam or I will crush a grand slam, but it came true. I'm very proud of myself because I always cheated in my math classes back in high school. I struggled. I still earned a C. Math was always my weakest subject, so yeah. I earned an A in every subject except math. 

This semester I decided to do the right thing by finding a tutor to help me out. I worked hard through my classes this semester despite a lot of personal issues. I got discriminated a few times. I got kicked out of the young adult ministry due to my justified anger. For instance, they were able to afford a pizza party for high school students, but they won't spend one cent on getting an ASL interpreter for me. That church can go screw itself. My dad went to jail a few weeks ago. I didn't get selected for an internship or job position over and over again even I keep applying to a lot of positions every day since last January. 2022 hasn't been kind to me so far, but I keep fighting on.

I told him that over the last year I have seen bare minimum change and that the major things I've repeatedly outlined have not changed at all.  He needs to get help and stop lying or for my own sake I need to end this before we walk down the aisle.

I'm devastated that it's come to this.  I feel like his mom is gonna say I don't understand his illness (bipolar 2) and find excuses for him. I feel like as long as she makes excuses he's not going to change and I told him I will not accept his excuses.

I told him if he wants to make excuses and live a life of lying and manipulating, he can go live at his parents house because clearly they'll tolerate that, but I just found out we no longer have use of our car because he lied and didn't pay the insurance.

493,My mom told me her retirement money runs out in 2 years and I'm worried and I don't know what to do,"TLDR: Mom has no plan for income after her retirement runs out in 2yrs aside from social security. My brother and sister are completely useless as supports so this problem will fall to me. She lives several states away from me and other family. I don't know how to talk to her about it or what I should do. 

*******************

My family is quite dysfunctional and also very small. My mom had 3 siblings, one has passed away and the other two live several states from her. Neither is married, neither has children. My mom is divorced since I was a small child. My dad was a deadbeat dad. My mom had three children and we grew up with an abusive stepdad and a generally dysfunctional home. My relationship with my mom over the years has been complicated and I've gone no contact a handful of times. My sister has mental health issues and my brother has substance abuse issues and cycles in and out of jail and prison. My sister is disabled and collects social security due to her mental health struggles and also chronic pain from back and neck problems. She lives in a very rural area in the southwest. She and my brother both primarily live off of my mom financially. 

If I were to describe the family dynamic my brother is number one golden child who is 100% enabled to be a fuck up. My sister isn't a golden child as much, but she does get everything she demands (including my mother buying her a home and property) by essentially verbally abusing my mother until she gets it. I haven't had any contact with my sister in over 3 years because she is so abusive. I'm the stereotypical middle child-- mostly ignored-- but no drug problems, no mental health issues, college educated, living independently. 

Recently, my mom told me that she will run out of her retirement money in less than two years. She didn't go into detail about how this happened but I know she took money out of her retirement to buy my brother cars (which he immediately wrecked or got impounded) that he never paid her back for, though she was adamant that he would. I know she bought her current house with cash, so my assumption is that she paid for it with retirement money. I'm sure there are other things she isn't telling me. 


Throughout my life I've basically received almost nothing from my family in terms of encouragement, emotional support, or financial support. I worked as soon as I was old enough to have a work permit and from that point forward supplied myself with clothes, bathroom supplies, gas money, insurance, food, etc. My first car was purchased with an insurance settlement from when I was in 7th grade. It wasn't a lot. I put myself through college and lived on my own. My mom opened me a bank account when I was a kid but then when I got older I realized that she was taking money out of it. Since I was a minor I couldn't open a bank account she wouldn't have access to, so my friend who was 18 opened one for me so my money would be safe. My adult years have been a struggle to have a relationship with any of my family and I've tried to build one, but eventually something happens and I realize that the circus that is my family is more damaging than helpful and I stop putting effort into it. I guess what I'm trying to illustrate here is that I've largely been independent of them since I was in high school and I've never really received much support of any kind from my family. In recent years I've noticed my mom trying a little harder and she has been emotionally supportive a few times but I am still not close with her. 

I've been kinda freaking out about what is going to happen to her once her retirement money runs out. Currently, she's pretty healthy but at her age that can change quickly. Having a paid off house is a great thing for her that adds a lot of security to her future but the problem is that she has no social supports at all if she stays there. My brother is currently living with her but he's completely unreliable and disappears for days on end when he's getting high. He could also land in jail at any time because he frequently has warrants and is perpetually on probation. My sister is also completely unreliable and quite frankly, extremely unpleasant to be around so that won't work either. 

The place my mom lives is a small town in a red state. It doesn't have good programs and public agencies for older people. Public transportation is also limited or non-existant and places to get supplies can be cities away. It's not a great place for her to grow old and have a network around her for support. I feel like I am watching a train go off the tracks in slow motion. This won't end well. I want her to move closer to me so that I can at least check up on her or easily stay with her if needed. Considering her finances though I'm unsure how to go about this without putting myself in a risky financial situation, like helping her buy a house or partnering with her in some sort of small business. She will always give my brother gobs of money and she will never tell my sister to solve her own problems. I wouldn't be able to live with her because she would never respect my boundary of neither sibling being welcome in my house. 

I feel like Etrayu trying to convince his horse to pull itself out of the swamp of sadness. At the same time, I don't know how to turn my back on this mess and not feel extreme guilt as I watch her struggle and suffer. I wouldn't be able to do that and figuring out what to do at that point will be much more difficult. I really don't know what to do.



EDIT: just got home and saw all of these responses. Thank you for your kindness and compassion. You don’t have to worry that I will ever, EVER support my siblings. Even if I could financially I don’t want anything to do with either of them. I also know with certainty that anything I give to my mom will go right into their pockets. So I won’t. Ever. The main problem for me is watching it happen. It’s going to hurt like hell to see it go down. I’m in therapy already but I haven’t brought up my family dynamic just yet. It hasn’t come up because I’ve been working on myself, building myself up, giving myself the praise and encouragement I literally never heard from my family.

500,mom...I have to get an abortion,"I took 3 pregnancy tests. 2 came back positive, one didn't have a control line so it was a dud. I also am not having my period this month.

Annoyingly, we used a condom and I took plan b and was about to restart up my birth control as I'd been off it for a while cause it wasn't necessary, I just had to wait till after my next period 🤦‍♀️ and I had just gotten my urine tested for pregnancy at the doctor's and it came back negative

We made an appointment at a planned Parenthood and called around to find the best price. We ended up finding a place that can cover the costs for me. I'm very scared.

Even worse, I need an ID to get it done and I don't have one so I'm frantically trying to get the DMV to give me a non driver's ID before my appointment. 

I'm about 2 or 3 weeks along. This morning I had cramping. While I don't want and can't care for the baby, I keep worrying I'm going to miscarry as that's common in my family. I found myself talking to it and I'm worried I will get attached the longer I'm pregnant. I absolutely cannot care for a baby. I can't even drive and I'm between jobs. I don't even know how to be an adult yet.

If anyone has any stories they are willing to share, any words of encouragement, any advice, please, I desperately need it right now. I'm willing to face the possible backlash this post may get.

I'm going to be getting a medication abortion but I have to keep it a secret from my family so I may have to carry it out at my boyfriend's house, which I'm not looking forward to

Original post:

I’m 26F, and pregnant accidentally. My partner is great and supportive, we’re planning to do an abortion. We do want kids long term, but like 5 years from now. Right now we’re not able to do it. In the mean time my body feels weird and all I want is to tell my mom and ask her what it was like for her when she was pregnant and commiserate with someone who’s been there before. But if I talk to her or my family they may disown me. They are the hyper conservative type. Previously have said that if I had a female partner (I’m bi), she wouldn’t be welcome at any family events… I guess I just could use some encouragement and maybe some shared stories of other mothers’ experiences. ❤️

502,"Mom, I finally understand why you stayed with my shitty step-dad","I was a self-proclaimed feminist at 9 years old after bearing witness to your relationship with my stepdad. He belittled you, disrespected you, cheated on you and I saw your esteem fall into the toilet. You chain smoked, you drank, you cried and threw items at the wall. You left him and came back, left again only to return, and the only reason you're not with him now is because you died. 

I promised I would never make that mistake. I couldn't understand how you didn't see yourself the way I did.  Brilliant, funny, creative, absolutely stunning. My hero.

But now I'm sitting here looking at the text from the guy in my life who ""isn't sure he wants me"" yet ""can't leave me alone"". A guy who texts other women, talks incessantly about himself, who quit AA and NA and refuses to go back to therapy. A guy who I stopped responding to on my personal phone for a 3 hour reprieve only to find my work phone blowing up with messaged from him about his journey to quit cigarettes and I get it.

You wanted to feel chosen. You wanted to feel worthy. You wanted that man who has put you through the ringer to change his mind and his actions as proof that you're good enough. I am not the spoiled teenager you last met mom. I am a tall, beautiful, compassionate, hilarious, DOCTOR mom! My friends and our family are devastated that I'm with him.

I’m hoping tomorrow will bring clarity. Please send hugs

Mom, after your death, one of dad's brothers adopted us, and gave us somewhat of a decent household. And then his long-term girlfriend left him and he FELL. APART. Nowadays he's ALWAYS drunk, and started voicing his misogynistic views. I'm worried that this will have an impact on your daughter, my sister. 

She's 9F and I'm 14M.

Speaking of, today morning she called me into the bathroom and told me she was bleeding ""down there."" I immediately knew what was going on but I don't have a clue as to what I'm supposed to do.

Do I congratulate her? Or do I go about it with a ""eh whatever its just normal"" attitude..? Is she a bit young for getting her first period?

We don't have any sanitary products in the house. What do I buy?? Pads, tampons, those cup thingies (???) or all of them altogether?

Are there different sizes or something? What brands are best? Also, can you find these products at any local store (like Target/Walmart) or do I have to go to a pharmacy?

How do I teach her what periods are and how to use sanitary products? 

And how do I go about period pain, and bedsheet stains?

Do I have to give her ""the talk??""

I feel like these are things a mother would usually teach her daughter, but I'm trying to fill in that mother figure role the best I can now that you're gone. I wish that at least our guardian would step up, but for the near future, I feel like he's just going to stay a useless, abusive, misogynistic drunkard.

He didn’t punch me or anything; it was just a slap, but it was very abrupt, and it’s the first time we’ve ever gotten into a fight, and the first time we’ve ever gotten physical. We’ve been dating on and off since March, though we haven’t been exclusive long. We were having a kickback last night and he was getting increasingly frustrated because of some setbacks at work lately. 

He got upset and was quiet in the way he often gets when he gets angry and I went up to him and asked if he was okay while he was talking to a friend  and unexpectedly he slapped me across the face. It was like a pimp slap. I immediately escalated the situation and dealt with it in the worst possible way because I kept crying super fucking loudly, and I tried to stop but couldn’t, which attracted even more attention to the situation. Everyone was watching and the night just became this abject shitshow. 

My friend got up in his face and screamed at him and threatened to call the police. I begged her not to, because people had brought Molly and psychs (I was sober but he wasn’t and I didn’t want any drug arrests) and no one was hurt by the slap, but she called them anyway and I had to convince the officers that I hadn’t been slapped at all. I felt paralyzed with self loathing and kept asking him if I had spoken to him the wrong way, or pissed him off that day. He denied it adamantly and told me that I was being kind and that he was disgusted with himself. He said he “never wanted to be one of those guys who hits women.” He has been apologizing again and again and making no excuses. 

I was always told to leave the second a man hits you, but he is genuinely remorseful and it was the only time we fought. Am I viewing things through rose colored glasses? Is it possible I’m partially responsible? Also, my friend is refusing to talk to me because she doesnt like how I covered for him for the cops.

JUST IN CASE: I do NOT give permission for this to be put in any kind of video, used for content on any other site, or posted to BestOfRedditorUpdates by anyone else... with the hope that my update will eventually be happy and I can post it myself.

TL;DR at bottom.

&#x200B;

Dear Mom,

I've needed your advice for years, and I truly wish I'd known of this subreddit years ago, but I (30sF) am glad to have found it now when I need it most. I'm writing this on mobile in google drive to copy and paste into desktop and I'm emotionally a mess right now, so I apologize for any errors, bad formatting, or anything that's unclear. I get glib when I'm upset, so I hope I can at least give you a laugh.

I'm in a pickle, to understate massively, but I can sum it up all problems big and small that make my whole picture:

1. My wireless keyboard shorted out from a clumsy water mishap(just happened a day ago, and my laptop's built in keyboard was already busted)
2. The VA denied my disability claim and will not consider a second attempt (old news)
3. I'm stuck in a codependent relationship where I feel more like a parent than a partner thanks to having to beg for affection and other sundry relationship problems (newer news but older than I'd like to admit... this news is over three years old)
4. Said partner (30s nb) may have long COVID (unverified news, jury's still out, but they're not exactly able to be super helpful, even when I repeatedly ask for help.)
5. We do not have a car (complicated news, my partner's business to tell in depth, not mine; but, basically our fault to caving to their family on something)
6. I can't get my self diagnosed but severe ADHD treated yet (somewhat new news)
7. I broke a tooth and it's infected (OUCH news)
8. My cat lost a tooth to be like his own mom, I guess (brand new and devastating news... proper cat tax will have to wait until issue #13 is resolved but willing to show proof if the mods so demand)
9. My not-from-service spinal injury is still untreated (@!#$ing aggravating, semi-old news)
10. I'm technically unemployed (also older news than I'd like to admit...)
11. Our fridge is nearly empty (I've been scraping the bottom of our pantry-barrel for weeks now... We're down to rice, pasta, a little bit of frozen fruit, and dry legumes)
12. Our SNAP got cancelled to spite me finally getting a sewing commission because we couldn't afford a doctor to fill out the disability paperwork... and they gave us less than 3 business days to do it (new-ish, frustrating news, but my state's govt support being a nightmare is definitely not news in the slightest)
13. Rent we don't have is due close enough that I'm getting wildly desperate (present, looming, pants poopingly terrifying news)
14. I have no blood family I can turn to (The oldest news of all of them)

Hence my being here, haha… I've been thinking of posting here for months but I'll explain what finally broke the dam.

My partner did not tell me, after I reminded them to work on new products to sell throughout the month and did my darndest to enable that work to spite my (medicated) depression kicking my butt.... that we would not make rent or the water bill until just yesterday afternoon.

YESTERDAY. AFTERNOON..

And I STILL had to ask about it before they would even bring it up. I don't have the emotional space to even be mad about it right now, I'm just numb while my brain's going into overdrive with what I can do in that limited time. Their family (mostly a bunch of dried up old homophobes with a few good eggs) is unwilling or unable to help.

We're right next to the border of Texas and Louisiana, the opportunities here are… not great, and that would be if I could even get out and work physically. I won't be able to do anything other than a remote job for a myriad of reasons, so the in-person dearth of employees doesn't really help me.

Over the eons I've been applying to jobs, customizing cover letters, emailing headhunters, USA jobs, directly through the VA, presented myself as calm and confident, been super eager and meant it, the whole shebang…. Should I have shown up with cookies, mowed their lawn first, promised a firstborn?

I've got nuttin, nada, zip, zilch, and zero.

I have an ancient eviction on my record and that's the first thing that shows up when my full name is googled, and I'm wondering if that's it? There's no telling. I don't have a public social media presence either, because I'm terrified my bio-mom will find me again, but I'm considering risking it just to have SOMETHING other than that eviction staring recruiters in the face.

I know this is the era of body positivity, but I know it's a fact that I'm not conventionally attractive, and I know that affects getting a job, too. I also give queer vibes from a mile away… so that might play a part too, especially in Texas...

I'm absolutely stellar at solving problems, I can MacGyver a good deal and skillfully at that, I love research, math is an old friend, I love diving in and getting things done, I can sew, I ENJOY building IKEA furniture when it's small enough that I can move it around without hurting myself and other related building activities, I still learn fast thanks to keeping my neural plasticity up, and my graphic design sensibilities, while a little outdated, are not too shabby.

I *know* I'm valuable, that I could be an amazing remote employee who'd be happy to see an excel spreadsheet, and that I deserve better than the situation I'm currently stuck in… but I just don't know the way out. I can't ask my bio mom, much less the rest of my bio family, for help or advice; and, while my friends are wonderful, they're not in any position to help me, either. There's one nearby, but they don't have room and have their hands full with their own strife at the moment (It's pretty serious, too...).

Am I crazy for still hoping that I should be able to crawl out of this? What am I not seeing? Should I pack it in and endure the abuse and speak to the bio-mom-beast for the first time in ten years? Should I break bad but with like legal cdb weed or something??? Become the first disabled DB Cooper copycat?!?! LEARN HOW TO LAY GOLDEN EGGS?!?!?!?!

 Hey mom, today I found out that I can’t have kids due to medical issues. 

Wanting kids is the only thing in my life that hasn’t changed. I’ve always wanted at least 5, with 7 being my max. I’ve had names picked out since I was a little girl, and my Pinterest is full of nurseries, clothes, and pictures of the family I’ve always wanted. 

But just like that, everything goes down the drain. I don’t even know what to do now. I’ve read so much about adoption trauma too, so I would feel like crap doing that. 

What am I supposed to do now? Almost all of my plans for the future revolved around the concept of having kids.

I just feel so…lost? I’d just really like some kind words atm


EDIT: Thank you everyone for all your kind comments, It truly means a lot. I can’t respond to everyone sadly,  but please know that all your comments have helped a lot 💜 For everyone asking, I was diagnosed with premature menopause. I’ve likely been experiencing it for years, but my old doctor chalked up my lack of periods due to ‘being young’. 

As for the future, I definitely want to grieve+come to terms with my diagnosis before doing anything. 

After that, I’m going to research as much as I can into all the possible options(fertility treatments, fostering, adoption, etc). 

Truly, thank you everyone💜",xte373,707,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/xte373/all_ive_ever_wanted_was_to_have_a_large_family/
514,"I made VP, mom. Without you.","Hi mom. I did it. I made VP before turning 40. Before turning 38, actually....it's effective August 1. 

Do you remember when I was growing up? How we lived in the house with no heat? I'd have to run to my room and jump under 10 blankets, breathing heavily under them to warm it up. Remember how my glass of water would freeze, even during the day? It was cold. But you were cold too...

Do you remember when I was sexually abused from 7-10? Sure, I was put in a couple therapy sessions, but you could never talk about it. I was so ashamed and it affected our relationship for the rest of our time together. You seemed ashamed too. You didn't talk about it. Do you know it's affected every relationship I've had since?

Do you remember how broken I was? I was arrested a few times, spent way too much time experimenting with drugs, i KNEW i was dropping out at 16. i was bullied to the ends of the earth, this helped me cope...do you remember how you blamed it on me? I was the ""brat child,"" but at the same time I was the kid who didn't need help. That's how you justified not helping me. Not parenting me. I didn't need it. 

I needed it. I needed my mom. 

Sometimes I still feel like that broken little girl. There will be an hour, half day, or even full day I want to crawl in bed and block out everything. I'll convince myself no one loves me unconditionally...that left after dad died. I dont know how, but I push through. My babies need me. My husband needs me. 

I've been married almost 10 years now. I have two kids. Do you know their names? You've never met them, but I wonder if people have told you about them. They are so smart and so sweet. My daughter is a lot like me...shes a tough cookie. You know what I say to her every night, whole tucking her in? I say, ""I love you JUST THE WAY YOU ARE. Don't ever change, you are beautiful."" I hope she takes that with her when I'm gone. Did you know I was terrified of having her? I didn't want to have the same relationship with her that we have. She's so beautiful, mom. I'm going to give her my all.

I'll never be able to give the kids their grandparents. My son knows about you. He knows you weren't what I needed to be healthy.  I'll inevitably pass along a few traumas, regardless of the therapy I continue to attend. 

But you know what? I'm a fighter, mom. You were right. I dont need you....I didn't drop out. I went to college. I worked my ass off. My kids have a safe, stable environment. We can afford excellent schooling. I take time with each, we go on kid dates, movies. You should see the new house we are building for them....mom, I went from poverty to security. Remember our entire house filled with dog shit? My house is now filled with love.

515,hi mom. im pregnant and want an abortion.,"hi mom. as the title says, i found out today that i am pregnant. i’m only 21 years old, have only been living 3 weeks with my boyfriend (unofficially, my address is still at my original home w my “mom”) and my period has been late for 8 days. i did a test this morning and i found out i am pregnant. i started to cry so hard and my bf was very supportive, but we want to abort it. we have to. we are both still in college, i’m still tied to my (abusive) mom and can’t just escape due to several issues and we dont have money or our own house. we live in my bf’s parent’s house bc his parents live in their new appartment. i never want kids anyway, he maybe wants some in the future. i dont want kids because pregnancy scares me so hard and i know i won’t be able to handle it mentally since i have a bad mental health. i would want children with maybe a surrogate or something in the future. im scared of the abortion though. my flo app says it’s been almost 7 weeks. i never thought about going through something like this this early, and now i got some information about abortion and the baby being 7 weeks and i kinda feel guilty and sad but it’s the best for us. also nobody can know, only you mom. my lil bean is about to get a heartbeat ): im not gonna tell my bf tho his heart will break. mine actually did already but it’s short pain. can i just get a hug mom ? can you tell me that i will be okay ? i love you. thank you for listening to me.

EDIT: I made the appointment! I will have to go on Wednesday (12/01) at 3:30PM (15:30). I’m actually very happy I van go this fast. Thank you all for the support, there were so many comments I couldn’t answer all of them, but I’ve read them all! My boyfriend is also happy I can go to the clinic next week already. I will think of all of you amazing moms and siblings when I will go there. I also get mandatory 6 days of time to make sure I 100% want it (it’s by law) so I should get the abortion on 18/01!",rw022i,708,190,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/rw022i/hi_mom_im_pregnant_and_want_an_abortion/

517,"Update:Mom, how do I find the nasty smell?","So I just posted today trying to figure out how I find the nasty smell in my kitchen.
Most people suggested it was rotting vegetables, there were a few guesses of the garbage disposal and many thinking it was mice.
After I pulled out the stove I found 3 mouse poops, and the outlet that the stove plugs into isn't fully sealed so there's a large gap that a mouse can go through. 
I also lifted the stovetop (Thank you for that idea because I didn't know it was a thing) and there was brown sludge in half of it. I didn't think it was an overpowering smell but obviously cleaned it anyway. Neither my husband or I remember spilling anything significant into the burners so my guess is a mouse climbed into the stovetop and peed and we still used the burners 🤮...
Now that I've fully cleaned the stove and the wall the smell has significantly decreased and I assume there's probably a decomposing mouse somewhere in the walls because my dog shows no signs of noticing a mouse and we don't hear anything. 
I guess we'll see if it still smells better by the morning but I think we've got it! (And I'll set up a mouse trap behind the stove just in case)

518,My mom has decided she doesn’t want to celebrate my birthday this year.,"I feel so silly feeling so hurt by this, moms. And also sorry for the long post.

I will be 32 on the 27th. I am the youngest of 3, and nonbinary. My mother is the type that “overdoes” things—the woman has 6 Christmas trees in her home over the holidays, and that is the energy she brings to all family occasions.

Except my birthday.

Since coming out at 19, my relationship with my mom has been rocky. I am married to the love of my life and have been for 7 years, my mom had to be convinced to attend the wedding and only did so because her coworkers were old professors of mine that adore me and guilted her into it. She has religious conflicts about it—and I try to be understanding of that and not force her hand because I know it is hard for her.

But this year has been different. I have been through therapy to get over things in my childhood (most of which do not involve my mother), and I started asking back in July if we could sit down and have dinner together and talk about some stuff from the past that I needed to process. I made clear it wasn’t really about her so much as wanting to connect with her and fill in some of the details I’m missing. She had excuse after excuse for why she was so busy. I gave up trying to make it happen in October. For context, I live 2 miles from her house. She visits my sister (and her 4 grandkids) 2 hours away, probably twice a month. 

So, my wife and I have birthdays a week apart, and we always go to my mom’s for a small birthday celebration. It has always been smaller than those of my siblings because of its proximity to Thanksgiving, and I have never really minded that. Today, as both our birthdays are near, I asked my mother when our gathering at her house would be, and she said she didn’t have time. She said, “I did buy you and (wife) gift cards. I will put them in your mailbox.”

This feels like such a gut punch. She has time for everyone else. And I truly don’t expect a lot of fanfare for my birthday and never have, but it’s hard not to feel hurt when I’ve been begging for a dinner with my mom for close to 6 months, and she can’t even clear an hour for my birthday. 

And then, some part of me thinks it is silly to be so upset. I’m in my 30s, I’m married, I’m celebrating my birthday with friends and chosen family, so it’s not like everyone is forgetting it. I don’t know why it hurts so much.

EDIT: Thanks so much for the kind words, moms and siblings! I feel very loved. I’ve been no contact with my father for 5 years (he is much worse), and I think that I hoped too hard that my mother would pick up the slack, despite the fact that she has always been cold and distant from me. Wishful thinking will hurt you every time. But I do appreciate everyone’s kindness and support, and I’m looking forward to a party with my wife and our amazing group of friends. Wish all of you could be there. 🥰",yzeh29,706,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/yzeh29/my_mom_has_decided_she_doesnt_want_to_celebrate/

I’m over 18 so you won’t even know. Won’t share insurance so my address won’t be updated. I’m going to make a second hidden Facebook where I can actually post life updates without fearing you. You don’t have my phone number anymore, so that will be the end of our contact. I don’t have to pretend to let you in my life soon, because you will stop being “FaAmIlLlLLlY”. I am now financially and chronologically free enough that I can take actions to finish our relationship.

You don’t know this but at 18, I had her be a joint owner of my new bank account. When I die, all my money automatically goes to her. You don’t even know the bank I have accounts at. You can’t steal this from me anymore. I’m working on making Mom my medical power of attorney, and block y’all from accessing me. I’m working on a living/final will, where you guys won’t be allowed at my funeral, and I have made my wishes that my death not be posted until my ashes are done being scattered known. You will never get to touch a piece of me again.

You are going to lose the last tie to me, which is being recognised as my mother, as family, by law. I can truly call you the stranger which you are. And you won’t even know.  I will truly be free. 

Bye bye.

My life has turned around.","I wanted to say thank you to each and every one of you that reached out in support, help, and kindness. Who offered their love and time to help me feel better when I couldn’t stop crying. I came here for every issue. Every fear. Every doubt.

And I received love and kindness like I never did before. Like my abusers should have but never did.

Things are still hard from time to time. Healing from abuse and trauma is hard and so exhausting. Finding work gets difficult. And dealing with difficult roommates on top of shelter life is constraining.

But I’m still so grateful at how far I’ve come. I’m grateful I left. I’m grateful I kept going even on the rough days. I’m grateful I left behind everything that held me back from the life I deserve. I’m grateful I stepped up to every new challenge and didn’t give up. I’m grateful I learned my worth, chased my dreams, and didn’t accept anything less than what I now know I want and deserve. I’m grateful I started over in a new city that I always loved. With new people I now happily call close friends. With new pursuits and careers that I feel fulfilled by. Unafraid, and bold enough to take the next step with faith and confidence in myself. 

I wouldn’t have gotten through those dark rough days in the beginning without this subreddit. Thank you Moms. I’m sending you all so much love and gratitude. 

Thank you for being there for me when I needed it most. Thank you for showing up for me like no one has. Thank you for showing me that real love is possible and possible for me.

539,I reported a creepy mechanic and he got fired. Justice feels so good.,"TW: mentions of Sexual harassment, sexual assault (no details)

Without going into it too much (because I really don’t want to have to think about it all over), I reported a Take 5 Oil mechanic for harassing me while doing my oil change. In fact, he was the store manager. I felt like I was being help captive since he had drained the oil and I was just sitting there alone, as the other employee left for their lunch break mid-service. I complained on Yelp in May so it would be publicly known that this place is not somewhere for young women to go. The company reached out on Yelp and asked me to email them for more info. I emailed them and they said sorry and sent a 20% coupon (which I strongly rejected, stating that I would never give my money to this company again).

My boyfriend had to go back there yesterday because they messed up his oil change that was done before mine. He was pretty vocal about his lack of enthusiasm for the company, and told the employee that someone had harassed me for over an hour when I took my car in months ago. The employee said “I know exactly what you’re talking about, he got fired and we have a new manager now.”

It feels like such a win. The company never told me he was fired or any action was taken. I hate that my boyfriend had to go back there, but I’m so happy to know that this guy will not be disturbing more women in a vulnerable position.

I wish I could’ve gotten justice for my sexual assault that happened in college. I didn’t report it. But this time I did get justice. And it almost feels like it’s good enough.",rabndy,667,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/rabndy/i_reported_a_creepy_mechanic_and_he_got_fired/

548,Does this make me a bad child to my deceased biological parents? Am I wrong to want this?,"UPDATE: 6/2/22 @7:30pm : I posted an update post but also figured I’d leave a quick blurb here too. I accepted their offer to adopt me. If you want the full explanation you can look at my update post, this was already a long post so I didn’t want to put it all here. 

So I (27F) have a couple in their early 60’s who have been in my life for several years. I’ve know there wife 10 years and the husband for 8 years. Over the course of this time they’ve become my “chosen parents” and have taken my in as if I’m their own. I spend a holidays with their family, have good relationships with their children and grandchildren etc etc. 

My biological parents passed years ago and were extremely abusive to me and it’s resulted in the need for therapy and at times I struggle with my relationship with my “chosen parents” because I’m still learning what a healthy family is like in some ways.

Well my “chosen parents” asked me over to dinner tonight so I went and ate with them. After dinner they said they wanted to talk about something serious (my abused self obviously internally panicked thinking they didn’t want me in their life anymore) well they told me that they wanted me to know that adult adoption was on the table as an option if I wanted them too. In our state you can adopt someone after age 18 assuming certain criteria are met, which they checked with their lawyer before mentioning it to me and we would meet the criteria. 

They told me it’s 100% my choice, I can say yea or no, but that by doing so it does give me the same rights as their biological children when they pass away, and things like that. 

My chosen Dad also said that adoption does not mean that I have to take his last name, but that if I wanted to he would be completely fine with it.

Does it make me a bad biological child if I say yes to this and take my chosen Dad’s name? 

For me it’s not about inheritance or anything, I don’t care about that............it’s about feeling like I’m truly theirs and that I have a family that is healthy and safe. 

I’ve always felt a little bit like the outsider because I’m not biologically/legally their kid while also worrying they’ll walk out of my life....and I feel like maybe this will help me believe I am loved and will be loved going forward.

I’ve been working on my first ever crochet blanket for almost a year - I’m not very good and my ADHD means that it’s been in fits and spurts all year. My gran died last November, and she taught me to crochet when I was a kid, but I’ve never done it as an adult. So I took it up as a sort of dedication to her. I never finish projects, but last night I finished it, and this evening I decided to block it. I used my steam iron, but failed to read the instructions online properly where it tells you not to let the iron touch the acrylic yarn, and in one corner where it had been curling, I ran the iron over it repeatedly, and now that corner is flat and I can’t undo it. I don’t know what to do, I’m so devastated. I was so proud of finishing it, and how good it looked despite all my little errors and now it is ruined, and how proud my gran would have been that I was using a skill (even if it was bad) that she taught me. I feel completely broken. I don’t know how to finish this post. It feels like there is no way to make this right.

556,Just found out my bio mom reads this subreddit and it kinda hurts.,"I don’t have a relationship with my bio mom. After years of her choosing everyone under the sun over me, I finally went NC. I gave her a condition, and I’m open to having a relationship with her if she sees a licensed therapist and not just her AA sponsor. It’s been so hard because I’m still a human being and as much as I try to fight it, there’s a part of me that will always want a relationship with my mom. But it hurts too much to be rejected constantly by someone who is supposed to teach you what unconditional love looks and feels like. 

Before we went NC I found my mom’s Reddit account and have checked it periodically. The other day I saw she had commented on someone’s post in here and it felt like a gut punch. She was always tripping over herself to be a good parent figure for everyone else, so it makes sense that she’s here. But wow, mom. You have three kids IRL who are dying for actual support from you, not just BS for fake internet points. You say all the right words, just not to the right people.

557,UPDATE: My partner is in the hospital and I'm so scared,"Hi moms and everyone else!

A week ago I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/x1s4ee/my_partner_is_in_the_hospital_and_im_so_scared/) about my partner being in the hospital. What set all this off was vertebral artery dissection on both sides - all from a sneeze! It's been a scary and tough week, even though my partner has been seemingly completely fine for several days now. However, an MRI showed some small strokes in the cerebellum and one small stroke where brain does all the sight stuff. It came as a shock for sure, and has been hard to process for us both. They're only 26! It's super scary that something like this can just... happen. They're on blood thinners and two blood pressure medications at least up until a control MRI or CT in a few months, and there will be a thorough sight/eye exam and psychological testing also.

But today I finally got my partner back home! I'm a little scared because they're not in the hospital environment anymore, and my own traumas are playing a big part in everything. I have a therapist though, had my weekly appointment yesterday and we're going to go over all of this when I'm ready. I'm trying to make sure I eat, sleep, drink water and all that, too. My partner needs to take things slow and steady for at least a month. They don't really have any symptoms, just get easily tired and obviously it's been a big shock.

Thank you so much to everyone who commented on my original post. You have no idea how much you all helped me. My partner read some of the comments too. This is truly an amazing community, and I will forever be grateful for all the compassion and reassurement. If something good came out of this, it's me believing a bit more that people are mostly good and kind and there's help available.",x7ague,629,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/x7ague/update_my_partner_is_in_the_hospital_and_im_so/

559,Mom I did it. I finally made an appointment to see a trauma therapist,I made a post a while ago about wanting to get therapy for the past trauma that I've been through but I was scared. I was going to make the appointment but I never found the courage to do it. Talking about it also makes me feel so vulnerable and I hate that. Its easier to just ignore but ignoring it leads to other problems. Something happened yesterday that triggered me and I completely knocked me off my feet. It was horrible and I ended up self harming because I didn't know how to cope with it. I really need to learn how to deal with these triggers in a healthy way. This morning when I woke up I decided to read through the comments on the post I made on here a while ago and those comments gave me the courage to get help. I did some research and I found a trauma therapist in my area. I called and the lady was really nice and now I have and appointment. Now all I have to do is show up for the appointment but I'm really nervous about it.,s0jp2h,629,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/s0jp2h/mom_i_did_it_i_finally_made_an_appointment_to_see/

564,Update on my roommate stealing my asthma inhaler because she was angry with me,"I made a post a couple days ago about my roommate stealing my inhaler because she was mad at me. She was mad at me because I told her to stop eating my food. I read all the comments on that post and everyone was telling me to report her and I did. Some people in the comments said that my roommate was trying to hurt me and I think they were right. 

After I made that post I couldn't sleep that night. I slept with my door locked because I was afraid of my roommate. I also slept with my inhaler under my pillow that night. I thought about it and I realized that I shouldn't be afraid in my own home. The next morning I saw my roommate. I asked her if we could talk about her stealing my inhaler and food. Apparently she's still mad at me and she told me to fuck off then she left. I was going to report her but I thought that maybe we could try sorting everything out first. I guess that was a mistake. 

This all happened yesterday. I really needed to get out of that apartment. The first thing I did was speak to my landlord. My landlord is not a very nice person. I explained to him what happened. I told him that I didn't feel safe in the appartment but he didn't really care. He told me that I can't get out of the lease unless I get my roommate to take it over and I highly doubt that my roommate would do that. The thing is our lease would be up by the end of next month. I still moved out because I didn't feel safe there. Unfortunately I still have to continue paying the rent but I guess it's not that bad since it's only 2 months. 

I was pretty upset after I spoke to my landlord. I had a meeting with my professor right after to discuss this project that I'm working on for her class. I am actually pretty close with this professor. I looked extremely stressed out and upset. My professor noticed and she asked me if I was okay. I then broke down crying in my professor's office. I was extremely embarrassed but I couldn't control it. I was under so much stress with work, finals and roommate drama. She asked me what was wrong and I told her what happened with my roommate. She was shocked and she called my roommate crazy. I told her that I was going to report what happened and she also thought that I should report it. My professor was really nice. She helped me fill out and submit an incident report on what happened.

I then went to the police station to file a report. My friend that brought the asthma inhaler for me that night went with me. I was waiting there for like 2 hours until I was finally able to speak with an office. He took my statement. He asked me if I wanted to press charges. I thought about it for a bit and I told him that I didn't want to press changes. I know that what my roommate did by stealing my asthma inhaler was horrible but I didn't want to press charges against her. He asked me if I would like an officer to speak to her and I told him that I would. They called my roommate down to the station and the officer spoke to her privately. I don't know what he said to her because I wasn't allowed to be in the room. When she got out she looked both scared and angry. The officer told me not to worry and that my roommate won't be bothering me anymore. 

I still didn't feel safe living with my roommate. I decided to move out. I call one of my really close friends. I told her what happened and I told her that I needed a place to stay. She lives in an apartment alone and she told me that I could stay with her for a while. She came over. Her and my other friend helped me pack. It didn't take us long because I didn't pack much stuff. I took my basic necessities - clothes, laptop, medication etc. I left the rest of my stuff in my room. I locked my bedroom door so that my roommate can't get in. Now I'm currently staying at my friends apartment. Her apartment is kind of small but she made it feel like home. I'm sleeping on her couch but it's surprisingly comfy. At least I feel safe here. I don't plan on staying at my friends for long. I have some money saved up and I've already stared looking at apartments. The past few days have been long and extremely stressful. I was also an anxious mess the entire time. Now I'm just trying to get through the rest of my finals. I'm doing okay. Thank you for all the advice and support I got on my last post.

Instead I'm going to use the money I'm saving up for it to plan a 500 dollar party to celebrate the marriage and use the rest to spend two weeks in *drum roll*..... Hawaii!

I made the decision when I visited my mom to look at clothes she got me from her trip and all she could do was call me fat (the clothes would stop fitting at my chest or shoulders, not my belly)

Then when I tried to bring up wedding dress shopping she got snippy and told me I need to find someone else. My mom doesn't understand that my fiancé is a good man and also thinks low of him for having food allergies and thinks my life is dreadful without the food he's allergic to (she's very dramatic and thinks low of me as well) 

And when I got home my brain was so fuzzy because I guess it already started repressing the day from seeing my mom and I realized, my mom isn't gonna be the type of mom who tears up as I try on dresses or help me with planning or anything of that sort so I would rather skip the whole thing than have to do the bridal party stuff without a mom

I'm still going to have some aspects of a wedding, pretty dress, nice tux, cake, dancing

I'm not gonna regret this because I'm saving myself from a ton of heartache, this will happen in summer of 2023

Six months ago my A1c (average blood sugar over 3 months) was 10.1 I just got an insulin pump and in less than 4 months my A1c dropped to 7.4

I haven't stopped crying. This is the best I've ever had. My mom used to yell at me when my blood sugars were high and that led me to be non compliant with medical care (also have had doctors yell at me, that really made me want to go to appointments (sarcasm)).

My mom is an abusive alcoholic and I haven't spoken to her in 20 years. I would hope she'd be proud of me.  My dad had type 1 diabetes as well and died from complications of it. I desperately want to tell him but I cant do that either.

I'm happy crying but i cant stop crying and its turning I to the ugly crying. I'm 39 but I really want my mommy for a moment. I dont mean to be attention seeking but mom, are you proud of me?

578,"Mum, I am terrified of giving birth and nobody is listening.","Update: Friday 6th May 2022. Thank you SO much to all of you. I told them what I wanted and the plan is this: they will break my waters on Monday to try to trigger labour. If it is unsuccessful, they will deliver her via planned c-section on Tuesday. So, our baby will be in our arms in the next 4 days, come what may!

Edit: thank you for all your kind and supportive comments. I will update you once she arrives 🧡

Edit 2: I have sat down and had a long, long chat with my partner. We decided that if I go into spontaneous labour between now and the 11th (due date), we will let nature take it's course and try VBAC. However, if I haven't had a call back by midday tomorrow, I am also going to go there and TELL them that I am going to have an elective c-section no later than the 11th. I will not risk myself or my baby like last time when we KNOW the dangers this time. We have the benefit of foresight here and I won't let them ignore me. Thank you for helping me be assertive, mums. I needed you and you came through for me 🧡

My son was born at 40+6 weighing 10.2lbs. I started to labour naturally but he got stuck. They tried forceps but he wouldn't budge and I had to have an emergency section. They accidentally cut the wrong thing and I lost a litre and a half of blood, and then developed preeclampsia. He was taken to NICU. 

I'm due with my daughter on May 11th and growth scans show she is going to be another whopper. They have set induction for my due date, but by that time she will be the same size as he was. I have been trying for *eight days* to speak to a consultant to discuss bringing induction forward, and nobody answers me. I have called the midwives, called the hospital, sent emails, left messages, and NOBODY gets back to me. I am now a week away and terrified. I am this close to just going for an elective section. I wanted to avoid it because the recovery is awful, I have a toddler to run after, I want more babies (risk goes up with each section) and I nearly died last time, but I don't know what else to do. 

I have been crying all day and I'm estranged from my real mum. I just need someone to listen to me. I feel like I'm screaming into the void. The hospital are the ones pushing me to go for a VBAC, but what's the point if she's going to be massive? It'll just be another emergency again. I need a hug, desperately. I know the NHS is stretched right now but I am terrified of what's going to happen and I feel like my wishes and concerns aren't being listened to at all.

579,My husband is home after his heart attack!,"David is home! There are still staples in his chest (didn’t know that’s how they close you up after heart surgery, didn’t want to know) but after a week of hearing nothing but praise at how well he’s recovering he is finally home. He’s still either in bed or on the couch, which he complains about but even the short walks he’s allowed to take to the bathroom are tiring for him. He did call our cable company within an hour of getting home yesterday to upgrade our sports package to watch ALL the baseball games, so that hopefully will keep him busy. And it helps how many people are coming over to visit him. 

His best friend and our kid’s godfather, Greg, has been a godsent. He’s extended his visit (he can work remotely) and has helped keep David still and with the kids, especially the twins. Who are at the moment banned from their favorite game “jump on Daddy until he throws them”, and Uncle Greg has stepped in completely. My son is back in school and seems to be doing better. I’ve had so many people step in to take care of him that I’ve barely been able to feel guilty about not giving him enough attention this week. Seriously, our community has stepped up in a huge way. There is so much food in my house that my in laws have had to take some to store at their house since our freezer is full. And so. Much. Alcohol. 

David has already tried twice to go back to work. Luckily I spoke to his boss and HR department first, and they responded to his suggestion to work remotely with “haha NO. We’ll wait until your wife and doctor say you can work again.” They are now some of my favorite people. They know how he can be. I’m still on leave until he can move freely around the house and has started physical therapy, and then will probably will from home until he’s completely up and active again. 

I’ve decided to just cut contact with my dad for the time being, and honestly as soon as I made that decision it was like a weight was taken off my shoulders. I did talk to my brother briefly, and it was fine, but we’re not close. The people here, David’s family, have been a lot more helpful. Greg has been telling me all day that we are getting drunk tonight. Specifically, that we are going to take tequila shots in front of David since he’s not allowed to drink. Something they did in front of me when I was six months pregnant. I might actually do it. David’s parents have offered to spend the night so we don’t have to worry about the kids, or even take the kids back to their place and I’m considering it. Considering our bed has become a war zone where the kids want in, and history has shown that their presence ends with a dog pile on one of us and David’s chest can’t take that right now. 

How careful he has to be with the kids is definitely one of his biggest annoyances at the moment. He’s very physically affectionate, and cuddling is difficult and roughhousing is completely banned. He is also annoyed that I removed most of his shoes from the closet. He only has slippers available to him now. I’ll give back his sneakers when the doctors say he can run again. He hasn’t discovered the padlock I put through the plug of his treadmill or that all of his weights are gone yet, so that’s something to look forward to. 

This is has been awful, but it could have been so much worse. He has a great medical team, our employers have been great, and our friends and family have really rallied in a way that shocked me. Even the hospital stay had some good moments. All the nurses adored my husband which made everything smoother but might have been an ego boost he didn’t need. We have a solid plan for his recovery, as long as he actually goes along with it and doesn’t try to overextend (ha!). 

And again, I need to thank the moms here so much. I was not expecting my IRL community to step up so much when I first posted. When you come from a shitty family, you don’t expect help.

580,hi Mom. I really hate my husband,We have a 2.5 year old toddler together. He works and I stay at home. He's been grieving the loss of his parents. They passed around the time our child was born. He was off all day today and there was only like 1 hour of child care that he actually did. He is just out of it all the time. He mumbles so I can't hear him and then he snaps at me. Whenever we fight he blames everything on me and admits no fault. We had a big fight today and the way he drove was off. There was a lady crossing the street and he didn't want to wait for her so he like creeped up the car close to her before it was safe to do so and she turned and gave him a look. What kind of person does that. I felt so disgusted. Is it normal to hate your husband. We're in couples therapy. I thought it was getting better but it's really not. I just don't like him anymore. He is not attractive. His personality sucks. I think actually hes kind of crazy. I don't know what to do. Is it possible to come back after this.

584,"Mom, please be proud of me, I can't share with anyone else","I've lived in a depression den for 9 years.  I pay rent on time every month and every time the apartment managers say they're going to come in I clean like crazy and shove all the things in every nook and cranny like a teenager ""cleaning"" their room. Last month they said they were coming in and I panicked.  I started cleaning and cleaning and throwing things away, very Marie Kondo even if I had to push my partner to give up things that have value but we're NEVER going to use. 

They came in,  checked things and left.  I breathed a sigh of relief.  However,  due to my crappy horrible garbage person lifestyle I (I mean I really am the fucking worst) haven't had them come in to fix things in years.  

My fridge doesn't work (freezer does,) my garbage disposal has a hole in it and I basically can't use my kitchen sink or dishwasher because water will squirt from that pipe, I don't have hot water, etc.

But one thing we've been dealing with for 6 or 7 years is that our air conditioning didn't work.

Mommy, today I tidied up and finally got the balls to call maintenance. Keep in mind, even if things were spotless I would still be anxious about people being in my personal space.

And I did that. I conquered my agoraphobia and my depression and my lack of motivation and my fear and I did it! I have air conditioning for the first time in at least half a decade.  

Please tell me I did well, mom,  I can't tell anyone else without them realizing how pathetic I was, well how pathetic I am.

Edit: 

Honestly I've been crying reading all of these responses so much.  I wish I could give everyone of you a hug and an award. I can't even believe Tyler everyone here has been so nice and not a single person has been rude or mean. Karma will give you all so much love because of what you put out into the universe and the love you gave to me, a complete stranger.  I just can't thank you guys enough.",vm3dvr,593,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/vm3dvr/mom_please_be_proud_of_me_i_cant_share_with/

586,"Hey mom, I kissed a girl at a party and I can’t stop freaking out even though my boyfriend says it’s ok","I’m a girl, I’m 16 (almost 17) I just want to stress that I can’t talk to my real mom about this. I want to talk to my uncle but I don’t know how to bring it up.

Pretty much, a friend had her birthday party on Thursday cause we had Friday off for Remembrance Day. I went with my boyfriend because I still can’t drive cause of my foot. My friend’s cousin was there and she’s 18 but also in grade 12. We talked a lot during the party and she was drinking (I wasn’t) and was getting close to me. When my boyfriend and I were about to leave, she kissed me goodbye and for a few seconds we did kiss and it did feel good.

My boyfriend just laughed it off cause he knows I didn’t mean to do it. He’s told me there’s nothing to worry about and it was wrong of her to do it without asking but if I’m ok with it he’s ok since it meant nothing. But now I can’t stop thinking about it and she has started messaging me. 

It feels wrong to have enjoyed it and to want to talk to her. I’ve never even thought about girls like that before but I am thinking about her. Please some advice or anything would be appreciated.",yuggzu,594,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/yuggzu/hey_mom_i_kissed_a_girl_at_a_party_and_i_cant/

591,I’ve come to the realization I’ve been gaslit my entire adult life. I need a Mom. Please.,"I always thought gaslighting was kind of this internet buzzword that everyone latched onto and overused to the point where it lost its meaning, but this morning I realized my mom’s been gaslighting me for years. It broke me.

I’ve spent my entire adult life defending my mom and minimizing the abuse and trauma I went through as a child. I’m finally confronting it and it’s a slow process, and I mostly can only apply what I’ve learned in theory rather than practice, but I’m getting there.

Today, I had a meltdown and during an argument with my mom I just shut down and kept screaming for her to tell me that it wasn’t my fault that my stepfather abused me. She has never, ever taken my side on this in the 25 years I have known my stepfather, but after I started seriously breaking down this morning, she suddenly changed her story and started yelling about how she always agonized over the way he treated me, how she went to therapy for it, fought with him over it, etc. She said we’d had these conversations before, which I don’t remember. I do have lapses in my memory due to trauma, but I feel like this would be a conversation I would remember.

And then she said something that didn’t sound right to me. She said she almost left him because of the way he treated me.

They did have a break pending divorce when I was like, 9-10, but at no point was it ever mentioned or even implied that it was because of the way my stepdad treated me. I called my aunt, who is my mom’s confidant, and asked her if my mom ever mentioned me when she was contemplating divorce from my stepdad.

My aunt said no. She was shocked. She told me this relationship with my mom was toxic, has always been toxic, and will always be toxic.

I feel so weak. I feel small. My partner has been telling me for years that my mom has been gaslighting me and I just brushed it off as some buzzword, but this morning it finally hit me. My mom has been gaslighting me when I’m at my most vulnerable. I feel sick. I literally don’t know how to process this. 

Especially in recent months, my mental health has been rapidly declining and my memories have gone with it. My mom has constantly been telling me about conversations I don’t remember. Simple things like about her getting vaccinated (she’s antivax and I begged her for almost a year, so this is something I would remember) or crucial things like being abused and neglected as a child.

Making me question my own memory. Did that really happen? How could I forget?

This is the very definition of gaslighting. I’ve been a victim of it my entire adult life.

Idk where I’m going with this. I’m just so fucking sad. I want a hug. I want to be told that none of what I suffered as a child was my fault. I want someone to tell me everything is going to be okay, even if it’s not true. I want a mom. I’ve never had a mom. I want a mom.",thf4z1,590,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/thf4z1/ive_come_to_the_realization_ive_been_gaslit_my/
592,I just realized,"That every time I see a post in this group along the lines of ""is this inappropriate/sexually abusive behavior coming from a man"", the comment section unambiguously agrees that it is.

594,"After 5ish days of migraines I (27F) finally let my adopted parents take care of me. Last night Dad took me to the hospital, I have a new found respect and sense of security……plus I finally feel better. I also feel like the worlds worst child.","I (27F) had been having on again off again migraines mixed with nausea/vomiting for 5ish days. 

My adopted Mom tried to get me to let her take me to the ER on day 2 and day 4 of this issue and I fought it hard. 

Finally morning of day 5 at 4am I texted her having a breakdown because I hadn’t slept at all due to how sick I felt.

I still went to work but when I got home they came to check on me and tried to get me to go to the ER. Finally 2 hours later after getting sick by simply drinking water I didn’t have any fight in me left so I let them take me to the ER. 

Dad ended up taking me, I don’t do well in hospitals, it skyrockets my anxiety, so once they got me settled and IV fluids in me they let Dad come sit with me.

Then came the medicines, when I tell you that it made me feel insanely weird and I hated the feeling it’s an understatement. I felt so weird it cranked my anxiety to the point of me physically shaking. 

Twice Dad asked if I was cold, I told him it was anxiety, he finally decided the best he could do in that situation was hold my hand until I calmed down. After about 10 minutes I got used to the feeling and slept for the first time in over 36 hours. 

Now that it’s over and I’ve seen my Dad be this gentle caring parent who made me feel safe in a situation where I felt so out of control of everything. While Mom was the person I went to for advice on how to soothe a migraine. 

I realized last night/today what a piece of crap kid I am to doubt them and question their love. Will I ever be good enough to deserve them?",vxdy76,588,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/vxdy76/after_5ish_days_of_migraines_i_27f_finally_let_my/

601,1st Gen. Homeowner - I did it.,"UPDATE: 

I’M A [HOMEOWNER! ](https://imgur.com/a/glZY9cC)!!!!!!!!  (See link for pics) 

I was blessed to turn a rental agreement into a a purchase in less than a year. 26 years old and just beyond grateful for life. Thank you to every person who was there in the comments as my mama, sister, brother, friend. I have been so busy and I will get back to you all. I feel so amazing today. 

I am so excited to keep working on my garden, improving the property and having the best memories with my son. 

I’m a homeowner ❤️ :)


…….
I’m beyond excited, nervous as shit. 

I’m writing a check for every last penny in my bank account tomorrow for the closing of my house. 

My little boy will have a home. A piece of land. Something my parents couldn’t do for my sisters and I. Something I am doing as a single mom. 

My parents couldn’t even fucking keep custody of us, and here I am breaking the stigma of the traumatic abuse, homelessness  and multiple house fires we went though. 

I’m sick to my stomach stressed and anxious, I’m praying to the lord that once this is finished I can focus solely on building a business to support myself, on top of working. 

Less than 23 hours until I am officially a homeowner. I want to wash my hands clean of the anxiety of going through this process. Writing away my savings, praying for consistency in the future. Praying for growth and progress. I’m just letting it all spill out of my fingertips at this point. 

Oh my heart is so swollen and shakey at the same time. I fucking did this. I DID IT!!!!!!! Well, almost… just 23 hours left to go.",vdpgod,583,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/vdpgod/1st_gen_homeowner_i_did_it/

604,Update: Mom I’m having another secret abortion and it’s killing me.,"Okay. That’s enough. You’re making A LOT of assumptions about our relationship, most of which are unfounded. 

My partner is a very affectionate, supportive, reliable person. Our relationship is healthy. This was a difficult situation for both of us and unfortunately our coping styles were very different. 

That being said, we’ve discussed the situation and it’s been resolved. He’s changed his behavior to be more in line with the sort of support that I need. 

Please stop making assumptions about him, saying he’s a bad person, or whatever else you’re alluding to. 

I came to this group for support because my own mother is not in my life, not so you could throw stones at my partner. We’re all entitled to our own grief. He’s entitled to his grief. I didn’t recognize it as such before but that’s what happened and we’re moving forward. 

To the people who were genuinely supportive and not just critical, I appreciate you.",una3ry,572,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/una3ry/update_mom_im_having_another_secret_abortion_and/
605,Husband throws parties and gets mad if I complain. I’m broken.,"My husband often invites people over for dinners, beers, even to stay for the weekend.   He’s in a profession where he always seems to have some long lost friend in town.  

He is always entertaining.  Several times a week.  And I am left with the mess, and usually the pre cleaning and cooking.  I hate it.  Hate it. And if I complain my husband gets mad at me.  Tonight he yelled at me because I complained about having to do the dishes.  He’s had friends over until now, I had to get our son to sleep and then clean up after his friends.  I hate cleaning up after his friends.  He knows it, and thinks I’m just unreasonable for complaining.  

This is actually threatening to break up our marriage.  My husband works long hours, and when he’s home, I’m cleaning and cooking after his friends.  There is zero time for me to go to the gym or even get a job which I would love to do.  (Our son starts school in September.). I just want freedom from these social events.  My husband travels for weeks at a time and it honestly feels like the best vacation when it’s just my son and I.  I can’t help to think how amazing my life would be without him.  Financially I would be truly screwed but that’s it.  

Tonight my son saw my husband yell at me for mentioning here was a lot of dishes to clean up and my husband thought that was complaining.  

I’m broken.  Very broken.  I know it sounds small, but I’m a free maid that gets yelled at and I have no life for myself.

Edit- I live in a place where leaving this marriage would mean a life of poverty forever.  I live in a tech town and I’m a teacher.  The most I’d be able to afford is a basement apartment.  For life.  This isn’t a case of “just move out and live your life.”  I don’t want my son to have to live below the poverty line.

618,"Hey mom, my wife and I have lived together for a long time and I’m very comfortable with food prep routines with her. However, we now have an adult man as a roommate and I can’t keep any food or drinks in the house long enough.","Just for context - my wife and I are lesbians, and have never lived with men before. That’s why this whole thing is annoying to adjust to. Neither of us eat very much (thanks to a combo of meds and eating disorder history) so food and drinks last a WHILE before I have to make them again. 

For example, I made 3 gallons of unsweet iced tea maybe 2-3 days ago. It’s gone. I made 50 uncrustables sandwiches and it lasted two days. I got a 12 pack of sparkling water and didn’t even get any. (We don’t really cook here because between the three of us, we have sensory issues that make most “bulk meals” impossible to eat and we all work multiple jobs.) 

I’ve tried separating my drinks and personal food, that works sometimes. But he’s… allowed to eat and drink. We split the groceries cost. 

I just literally can’t make enough to last and I’m so tired of constantly being out of things I want. 

Any ideas? How to make more bulk things? Storage ideas for how to make more of anything at once? 

We do have a deep freezer we can use, but if 50 uncrustables for example are out in 3 days between 3 of us eating them (with him eating way more), how can I possibly prep enough to HAVE a stock? 

I’m overwhelmed. We’re going through food way more than we used to, and I’m too tired to keep doing this.

EDIT: I really thought when I wrote this that I was being so selfish and inconsiderate and just needed to figure out a better way to do this. 

Thank you all for the reality check. I needed it.

The whole family knows and is excited but, I’m worried. It’s not better. Even though the panics got better, he’s still not functioning. No drivers license no job, and a lack of motivation for one. He doesn’t clean but he cooks sometimes. I work 9-11 hour days, sometimes even 13 and I can’t manage much during my weekends but so much needs to be done. His words always outweigh his actions. And I can’t talk to him about it or else I’m in the wrong. I love him I do, I don’t want to leave him but I’m worried it’s never getting better. But I am only 21 and have never experienced a healthy relationship, every one I had before was so traumatizing. And if I do leave him he has nothing. We moved away from all of our family and he has no money I don’t know what he would do. I just don’t know what to do. I can’t keep being his caretaker, I need to be taken care of for once. My inner teen expects me to fix him and then maybe it will get better, but my inner adult knows it’s not up to me to fix anyone.",y01owi,552,135,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/y01owi/i_dont_know_what_to_do/

628,"Mom, I did it.","TW: addiction but positive!

I did it, mom! On July 16th, I made it 2 years clean. I fucking did it, mom!

Those two years were full of... so much. We lost the house, we relocated 300 miles away from everything we knew. My first real heartbreak – God, I wish you would've been there for that, I really could have used a hug. But people helped me through it, and I got better at handling things. 

Also, something I've always wanted to tell you: I'm in a band now with three of my best friends – we don't have any songs, but if/when we did/do, I'll always wish you'd be there to hear it. It's a lot different from the songs I used to sing to you on my stage made of foam puzzle pieces with my laser light projector and my karaoke mic when I was a kid. I'll never forget the time you actually got dad to come to one of my pretend shows. 

Life is still really hard. But I'm making it. Two years, mom! Two entire years. Technically more than that now! I actually did it! :)

632,I've been underfeeding my baby,"This is my second baby and I feel like I should have known better. She's 12 weeks old and dropping percentiles on the weight curve significantly.

With my first I struggled with breastfeeding and gave up at about 6 weeks. This time I got much better support and was feeling so proud in the last month to be almost exclusively breastfeeding. She would be sleepy or smiling and playing after a feed, and I often had to wake her up to eat at the 3 hour mark. But I think I missed her hunger cues. 

Today I've offered top up formula and she's taken it every time. She's gone from 50-100ml of formula a day to 400ml today. Now I think I've been underfeeding her that much every day and I feel so guilty. I feel like I've let her down and I'm a crap mum...

Then in the span of 2 days I tested positive, went to the ER for bleeding, saw the baby's heartbeat and fetal movement, and saw the giant clots of blood in the toilet as it passed. My husband is too sick and symptomatic to be of any help. He's trying, but he knows there's nothing either of us can do. The first grader has magically tested negative in spite of her positive little sister hanging all over her. I'm volleying back and forth between crying my eyes out and feeling absolutely numb.

636,I'm getting an abortion tomorrow and I'm feeling sad and depressed,"***(Please note I'm pro choice and my thought applies to no one but me, this choice is VERY personal, and we all have different situations I would never judge an women for choosing this option)***

I'm 30 and I got accidentally pregnant on vacation,

I alway wanted a big family but don't feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be/ wants to be in life right now. I'm trying to change career as I'm not satisfied with mine and my relationship with my boyfriend of 3 years is chaos, we fight a lot and don't have intimate moments that much anymore as we're quite frustrated with each other since lockdowns. So things could be better in terms of bringing a baby into this world. Those are all the reasons why we decided to go ahead with the abortion, even though the last weeks has been torture, I couldn't make my mind up as if I truly wanted to go ahead with the abortion or not. And here we are, my abortion is scheduled tomorrow at 8am and I'm super depressed and sad. I havent done anything all week apart from eating and watching tv. I still have doubts about this and can't help thinking we're selfish a-holes playing God for ruining a potential amazing human chance in life. And of course it got the way to my heart, I feel like I would love this baby so much, I have no doubts about it. But I'm so f-ing lost in life I would never want my child to suffer because of me.

**Is it normal to feel this lost on the day before an abortion ?**

I made a promise to myself last time I aborted, it was to never go through this again as it was so hard and traumatizing. *(I got pregnant quite young while on the pill)*

639,Hey mom. I broke up with my boyfriend that pressured me into having sex with him.,"I made a post on here yesterday about this and I just thought that I should let you know that I 19F broke up with my boyfriend 26M because he pressured me into having sex with him. Basically I'm on anti depressants and it has caused my sex drive to be very low. My boyfriend well ex-boyfriend now has a very high sex drive. I talked to him about it, he was really understanding at first but that changed after a few weeks and he started pressuring me to have sex with him.

Two nights ago I was in a really bad place. I was having a depressive episode, my dog had just died and I ended up self harming for the first time in a while. I called my boyfriend over because I needed some support. He came over and not long after he tried to initiate sex. I told him no but he kept asking. I was so exhausted and tired and I eventually gave in and told him yes because of him constantly asking. He also made me feel guilty about it and he was tell me that I don't love him anymore and that I don't care about him anymore. So I said yes and we did it and right after I said yes I wanted to take it back but I didn't. I just laid there and I let him use me until he was finished and I really just wanted to get it over with. 

After reading the comments in my last post I realized that I was sexually assaulted. I really didn't know that this was considered sexual assault and I'm honestly still having a hard time accepting it. Anyways this morning we talked and I broke up with him. I told him why and I told him that he hurt me. He was upset and he told me that I'm over exaggerating. We started screaming at each other and then he took his things and left. I'm so mentally exhausted right now. I'm trying my best to ignore it and I just want to forget about everything. I'm trying to keep myself as busy as possible so that I won't have time to think about it and when I'm not busy I'll just take a nap or something. I really don't want to think about it. I'm also trying not to blame myself because I made a lot of stupid decisions.",s8jm6a,532,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/s8jm6a/hey_mom_i_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_that/

653,My mum cancelled attending my wedding dress fitting again and I don't know how to address my feelings.,"I'm hurt and upset. I had to move it a couple of times to accommodate her because I want to include her and show her how much she means to me. I can't reschedule it without a fee, and I can't wait too much longer or I won't have it ready in time. I don't have other family or friends in the area who can come with me, either.

But on the other hand, she's leaving in a hurry to help my grandmother who is embroiled in a contentious legal battle over inheritance and is facing losing her home. It's been like this since May, and my mother's told me she can't think about my wedding or help me with it until this is over, and hasn't shown any interest in my plans. I've done all I can to help but there's very little that can be done.

I feel selfish getting upset about this since people can have more than one focus and I'm an adult. Being homeless is a lot more important that my wedding, but I can't help but be hurt. I don't know how to feel or how to deal with these emotions. I just need a little support and advice.

**EDIT**: I just wanted to let you all know how much the outpouring of love, support, and motherly advice means to me and I am so appreciative of every single comment. Some of your comments made me cry (In the good way, I promise!) I wish I could give you all a hug. While I don't know that I can zoom with you all, I promise I'll post pictures as soon as I can.

I was also able to have a heart-to-heart with my mother this morning while she was still here. I asked her if she was still going up and she said no, not right now. She explained that she felt she was just as effective here as up there since at this point in the case it's phone tag and emails and waiting on the lawyer. I asked her if she was sure, and she confirmed it, at least for now. So she'll do her best to be there. I did confess to feeling upset and frustrated on my grandmother's behalf and the thought of my mum leaving, but told her that I've never been mad or upset with her. It's just the circumstances. I also re-affirmed that I want to do whatever I can to support both her and her mother, and we're going to work to rally some extended family close to my grandmother so she'll have support until my mum decides it's time for her to go back up. I feel like a silly goose (or is it duckling here?) for being all upset and having it resolved so easily.

665,"Mom, I am so angry at you and my heart is being ripped apart.","**UPDATE: just submitted a report to the official abuse hotline in my state. Scared shitless but if it will protect my grandma I'm all for it. My mom can screw herself.**

I drove down to the house you and grandma share today.

I spent 8 hours helping her go through all of her linens, the contents of her hutch. Her cookbooks. Her kitchen tools.

She had a story for damn near every piece. She gave a lot of it to me, and the rest went into a pile for her estate sale.

Near the end of my day there, I was looking out the window every 5 mins, terrified of seeing your car. You see, you didn't know I was here. I made a point of not telling you.

Well, when I was putting everything into my car you came back. The look on your face was absolute rage and betrayal. Once I was done loading my car I went to leave and you started crying. When I said bye to you, all you had to say was ""I hope one day we can reconcile"".

Well, I don't, mom.

The only reason grandma is having an estate sale, or moving at all, is because you are kicking her out. You promised her a home for the rest of her days. But here we are. You're forcing her to move in with friends in another state, so you can marry a man you met on the internet a year ago. You are forcing her to pay ""back rent"" for the years she lived with you. YOU ARE FORCING HER OUT OF HER HOME. She is the only family I have left and you are just throwing her away. By the way, I'm still waiting for you to tell me this yourself - grandma had to tell me a month agl because you still haven't. 

And you have the audacity to be mad at me because I'm trying to help her. I don't want her to leave. But she has nobody to help her pack and she is overwhelmed. 

I hope you know that every time I come to help her pack, I'm taking a carload of my stuff. So by the time grandma is gone, I won't have a single fucking reason to ever go in that hellhole of a house, or speak to you ever again. I'm simply tolerating you until then.

You are narcissistic, abusive, allowed us to be abused by your late husband, and you've been abusing grandma and making her feel like a burden as long as she's lived there. And I fucking hate you for it.

I'm losing my closest family member because of your selfishness. I came home and sobbed as I put away the dishes and linens she sent me home with.

670,Miscarried and I'm so angry and sad,"I don't normally reach out to strangers for comfort but I don't know what else to do. And I think right now I really do just need a mom. 

On February 28 I found out I was pregnant. I wasn't trying to get pregnant, I'm 26, divorced, and still a student so it definitely wasn't in the cards. I am not even sure who the father was because I was casually seeing two men at the time and had protected sex with both of them within a few days of each other. 

I didn't know what to do. I didn't tell my family for several days because they are very religious and the potential fathers...were not supportive. They centered their own fears and anxiety over mine. They tried to tell me what to do. They sent me warnings of what life would look like with a baby. They offered no emotional support. It was frustrating and lonely. 

But I fell in love with my baby, even though termination was on the table. It was a choice I didn't want to make. It was impossible and devastating because I loved it. I think it would have been a girl. And I felt an instant connection with her. I felt more alive than I ever have in my entire life. I smiled looking at my belly, I wanted to touch it constantly, and I even made her a playlist of songs that just made me feel like she was happy. I *loved* her. 

On March 8 I went in for an early ultrasound because the day before I felt something was wrong. I couldn't feel her anymore. That liveliness was gone. There was no joy when I listened to her songs or saw myself in the mirror. And I was right. The ultrasound showed the gestational sac was empty at 7 weeks. 

I feel so alone. My own mom didn't even have the decency to check on me after I told her what happened. She called me more often to persuade me not to terminate than she has after I lost it. When she texted me the other day it was only to remind me to forward my mail.  The fathers have been unhelpful in comforting me. They never understood me and why I would want to keep her. I don't talk to one anymore and the other seems to be growing impatient with my grief. I am alone. 

I'm devastated and angry. I miss her. Even though it was so early, I miss her. I haven't passed the tissue yet because my body still thinks I'm pregnant, which makes it even harder. A constant reminder. Constant waiting.

I just want someone to hold me and let me cry safely. I just want people to listen to me scream. I am angry because no one cares  and no one knows how to help me.

Will it ever feel normal?","I(27F) am in the process of being legally adopted. My biological parents have passed and my new parents have been in like approximately 10 years. 

So this morning Dad and I were talking about how he took me to the ER Monday night and I started apologizing and thanking him again for losing sleep and being willing to sit there for hours with me. 

He told me “that’s my job, to make sure you’re taken care of no matter how old you get, Dad’s protect their kids, not hurt them” and I was just kinda stunned silently because it feels like I’m in a whole different world. 

Then he says to me “good Dad’s have a healthy level of protective instincts built into us, not the kind that shelters or holds our children back, but the kind that lets our kids grown and learn while as a Dad we still know we’d die for them and would do anything to protect them and keep them safe, which is why it kills me inside to know I couldn’t protect you sooner” 

I went from a life with a biological father who was my main abuser to a Dad who views it as his job to take care of and protect me.

I just worry this will never feel normal. That I’ll never be ok enough for this stuff to not have a shock value. 

Will I ever be ok enough to feel normal? Did he serious about the protective side and wishing he could have protected me sooner?

678,Update: prom dress,"Here’s the [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/tl4uwe/mom_is_the_prom_dress_i_choose_really_that_bad_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I did not expect my post to blow up as much as it did. Thank you mums, dads, big sisters, big brothers and well everyone who comment and some who texted me. The support was overwhelming and it meant so much to me. I know I didn’t reply to all of the comments but I promise I sat and read all of them - and there were a lot. It was overwhelming how supported and cared for I felt. It definitely made me feel so much more better knowing so many people loved the dress. It made me realise that I don’t regret buying it but I do not completely like certain elements and so I will alter them to make sure I completely love the dress. Couple things I felt like I had to address and update on.

1. My boyfriend has never controlled what I’ve worn before. Ever. This is the first time he’s reacted badly. And I do want to note that I appreciated all of you that provided or took my boyfriends perspective into picture. At the end of the day we’re 18 and we’re not grown. I’ve made mistakes and so has he. It doesn’t make any of us a bad person. But thank you for the concern and care all of you had. It genuinely meant a lot knowing I had people looking out for my well-being. It’s something I haven’t experienced a lot of. We talked about the dress and came to something that both of us love without it really feeling like I don’t get to wear the dress I want. I just want to say, my boyfriend is a very good boyfriend. He helped me through my body insécurités and has definitely taught me to learn to love my body a lot more. This is a one off situation. He always has made me feel pretty and gorgeous. I wanted you guys to know that I’m okay and that he isn’t bad or abusive. He had his own opinion and I realise that’s okay. But thank you for your care and concern. It meant a lot to me. 

2. I did ask him for his opinion. He didn’t just say he hates it and to burn the dress. I hadn’t done the backing properly and he made a weird face. When I corrected the backing he said it looked better. He did show he hated it but did tell me that it was his opinion and I should wear it if I like it and want to. But in my head it’s mine and his prom, I want both of us to like it and enjoy it so we decided in a way to compromise. 

3. I love the corset structure and poofyness of the gown and I will not be changing it. He doesn’t really mind about that and infact said those things were quite nice. However, I do not like the embroidery for two reasons. It hasn’t been done well (it’s looks horrible attached) and I just am not someone who likes embroidery. My plan from the beginning was to get rid of it (I’m sorry to all those people who loved the embroidery. It’s just not my style) and turns out he also didn’t really like the embroidery that much so when I had told him I planned to remove it - he agreed. This is genuinely my choice. The second thing is the sleeves. Although they looks great on picture they’re so uncomfortable and restricting to wear so I’m considering changing the sleeves to thick straps. He doesn’t really mind the sleeves this is something I wanna do. 

4. I spoke to him about the whole thing and he apologised. It was a sincere apology. He also revealed that he just didn’t really prefer or like the color too much. For many reasons none having to do with it looking good on me or not. He said it looks good on me but the colour on the dress for the theme of prom just did not work and I would be the odd one out. So I decided and he isn’t aware yet of this. To dye the colour to a darker colour. I’m not a very colourful person to start with and hence this isn’t really much of a compromise for me. I really didn’t care for the colour I cared for the structure of the dress. So I’ve decided to dye it a black or darker navy colour. He isn’t aware of this. I’m planning to make the alteration and then I’ll decide if I want to wear it (most likely yes cause I love the corset top and floofy bottom). Could you guys give me suggestions on what colours I could maybe dye my dress? 

5. This is very much out of normal for me. I dress completely different and it took him by surprise. He told me he didn’t even realise I liked clothes like this.   This as well as the support from you guys made me also realise that I wanted to change the gown so I personally liked it better and it suited my style much better. Hence the above alterations. 


Overall, I’m planning to alter the dress so that I get my floofy ball gown I dreamt off and it’s more I guess in a way approprié for the theme of prom and the generational style I guess? (Idk how to explain it) essentially in a way that I get my dream but I don’t have to be conscious about what others think cause I’m making it more my style as well. This also works because I am able to get everything I want while making sure that my boyfriend also likes the dress. (The change in colour). I don’t know if you guys would be happy about this. I don’t know if I’m going to be told off in the comments because this isn’t the update you guys wanted. But over all, it’s JSUT so much better because I feel like I really didn’t have to compromise much since what I actually love about the dress I’m keeping. I hope that I have this families support. 

Again, thank you everyone for so much support. All the moms, dads, brothers and sisters who replied. It meant so much to me and honestly I almost cried because I have never felt so supported before. Thank you for guiding and supporting me. This sub really became the support system I never experienced. 

To all of you who suggested Pearl necklace- I will be doing that. I absolutely loved the idea. I have no idea what to do for earrings cause I don’t have matching earrings but I will figure it out. I will be safe during my prom, thank you for all those who gave me advice like I was your child. It made me feel like I had parents for the first time in a long while. I loved feeling like I had a mom, a sister, a dad and a brother. Many of them.

u/RedChairBlueChair123 I would love to taste your lasagna. In fact after reading your comment I really wanted to taste some of yours. Again thank you guys for the support. I would love to hear what colour you think I should do. :) I love you guys very much. Thank you again. 


Tdlr: talked to him, he apologised for reacting so badly.

But sometimes he does things that really weird me out, and honestly I have a tendency to be attracted to men who turn out to be pretty bad for me. 

Examples- 

- 20 mins late to second date, he was in a restaurant on the same street with a work colleague, didn’t text in advance to say he’d be late

- kinda self absorbed? I realised he’s not great at asking me questions. So I just answer for myself sometimes ha. I thought he had poor social skills at first but I’m now wondering if it’s something else 

- said he has 10 kids via sperm donations and he was in demand for his colouring, academics and height

- twice he’s asked when am I free to meet, I send some suggestions, and he says “let me check my plans”. Which feels like game playing because… why would you ask me in the first place. I follow up and he just doesn’t confirm. 

- sent me a nude with another woman’s underwear in the background and when I asked said it was an old pic and it belonged to “some female or another” 

- is very into rough sex and bdsm. In bed he was initially very giving and we had a great time together. Now he’s asking for anal, to choke me, he slapped me randomly last time in bed. He said he bought his ex a gimp mask and went to orgies with her abs bought her a slave collar. He’ll also randomly tell me about the size of her genitals like wtf why tell me this 

- he keeps on setting up businesses that don’t seem to go anywhere. Setting one up just now and trademarked it and everything but no actual business exists yet. Old one seemed to only have one client and be deeply unprofitable. I literally work in small business incubation and he hasn’t asked me about my job or thoughts once ha 

- forgets details  about me. Like the fact we went to the same uni together 

I don’t know, I was super keen on him, and enjoyed my time with him in person. He is totally my cup of tea looks wise. I like that he’s smart and has a lot of shared political opinions.

683,update on a coworker stole my jacket from locked office,"Update to the update:

Today, I contacted work in writing and let them know I'd be filing a police report. I went to the station and spent a couple hours going over everything with the very nice officer. He was very thorough so that was a good sign.

Talked to the manager over the phone after and she let me know they had her caught on camera leaving with the bag (but she denied anything to do work the jacket). They're happy to hand over the videos to the police. Police have been told which cameras are relevant and the approximate times of everything. 

I don't know when the police will investigate but it seemed like I had a decent case. I will have to work with her until the investigation is complete unfortunately. 

Hopefully I update tomorrow, but it could take much longer. 

End of update

******************



So it's been a rough week. A lot of stuff has happened in life, many of them not jacket/hoodie related.

But the jacket/hoodie saga continues. I brought it up to my manager when I returned to work and kept getting told they would review the footage. The manager apologised on behalf of the company and is asking to see if they can maybe purchase a new jacket or pay for one (the one I had was worth around ~150$ brand new, but had great sentimental value and was years old). It's a nice gesture...but it's not my jacket.

I talked to a few coworkers and based on some other small dishonest things this coworker has done, it seems this is not the only time she's had sticky fingers. 

I work hospitality so my manager seems concerned. Yet this coworker is still working as normal...I'm not sure if they're building a case against her or just ignoring this issue. 

She's very obviously stolen the jacket at this point. My manager asked me not to confront her yet. But has also told me at a different point that even if they don't see her steal the jacket on camera they support me in whatever I decide to do next. I have no idea what that means. Do I get her address so I can show up with a few scary friends? 

It's all very frustrating. Supposedly they're finally checking the camera footage today. My manager was supposed to contact me today but didn't.

I don't know what to do. The room she took the jacket from doesn't have cameras. But I know she walked out at the end of the day with a very bright reusable bag I was carrying in at lunch. Very likely her walking out was on camera. So I'm trying to figure out what my options are. Even if work pays for a new one, I don't really want to let this go until I at least confront her. 

The one day I had to work with her thus far, she asked me about my jacket, I said it hasn't turned up (hoping that after being asked about it by work and myself she would bring it back). She kept trying to chat with me, way more than she would on a normal day. She's the supervisor at work, and in her 40s. Not a kid, and better paid than me, even if just by a bit.

I'm so angry that she did this so blatantly. If work hasn't taken care of this by the time I'm back I don't know what to do.

I think making a big stink at work is my only option if they tell me too bad it's not on camera. Surely her walking out with a bag I walked in with means something? 

I'm sad and mad. Blah.

I(15m) knew he was way older (late 20’s) than me but it didn’t matter at this time because I was looking for a friendship (it’s lame ik). So last week he told me he would be 30mins away from where I live so asked me if I wanted to meet him and of course I said yes. So we met at a public place and but I don’t know I was so mesmerized by him I can’t explain it but  couldn’t tell him no so we ended up in a hotel room and I had my first experience and I regret it, it wasn’t good at all and I feel bad and embarrassed about it. I don’t blame him at all because I gave my consent but I feel dumb not seeing it coming, of course he wasn’t looking for a friendship but for sex and I fell for it and it sucks.",vtm5vc,478,190,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/vtm5vc/mom_i_met_a_guy_online_and_we_met_irl_and_now_im/
690,my ex wants his stuff back after almost 4-5 years later,"Hi mom, so my ex who I was with for 3 years (nasty break up cause I found him asking other girls for sexual favors) messaged me out of no where Wednesday asking for stuff that is no longer here back. Now for some background, when we broke up for 2 years I had told him to come get his stuff (a guitar, a pair of pants and some other stuff.) He told me I could mail it knowing that I had no money, he didn't bring it up for any time after. I moved on and am slowly moving out so we got rid of stuff cause I'm not a storage unit so like the hell. I have informed him that I've basically moved out and have no idea where he stuff may be, he's always had this weird thing for me even after our break up even when I was seeing other people he'd message me asking for ""favors"" and im just over here dumb founded that he'd ask me that. Another thing about my ex, when I found out he pulled the ""it's nothing"" card after finding out what he was doing my love for him died and I was numb to him.
He had lied to our mutual friends to save face saying I gave him permission to sleep around, mind you I have a lot of people on my side and who know the truth on what he did and had done, he doesn't know that they know. 
But he's apparently going to be coming to my area soon, for what reason I don't know. But if he tries something my boyfriend will not have it and I carry but I don't know what he thinks I'd still have after almost 4-5 years later.
Any advice what I should do about this situation and what to do about my ex

Edit: so I'd just like to add now that I'm not so busy, he knows where my grandparents live (where I use to live) I have not spoken to him besides in some friends chat on twitch cause we are both her moderators, but I try to ignore him most of the time cause the way he acts, I also live in FL. He claims to be coming down here at some point but I don't live at the house he knows of so if he does show up he'll more than likely be turned away at the door.
The only time I actually ever do speak to him is when I am live on twitch, 95% of the time I do not speak to him or acknowledge him. My online friend thinks he has a weird jealously because I'm with my bf and such and have been busy with life. Thank you all 🥰🥰🥰

Edit/update: I have told him after he asked me again if I had his stuff I told him ""I do not know where any of your stuff is as I do not live there anymore and whatever my family did with it is not my problem."" And he stopped asking after saying that so many times. He has stopped messaging me or trying to get ahold of me personally since.",ua9by6,480,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/ua9by6/my_ex_wants_his_stuff_back_after_almost_45_years/

696,I’m having a hard time not exposing my parents,"My parents growing up gave me everything materially I wanted. The best teachers, the best toys, the best clothes. They even sent me to the best college they possibly could, in another country.

However, my mom is sick. In the head. She weighed me and tracked my weight and cycle up until I moved out. She watched me shower. Picked out all my clothes (like literally would pick out my outfit every morning as if I was a toddler), she pushed her eating disorder and body image issues onto me. 

I recently reached out to my dad about everything that happened, and he doubled down and blamed it all on me. Said if I was uncomfortable I should have spoken up for myself (I tried. Multiple times. Most of the time when I objected to something she was doing she’d ground me for being disrespectful). 

Both of my parents are super image conscious, my mom in particular is obsessed with Facebook and all her friends are too. I’m tempted to post everything that she did, and if people try to tell me I’m lying I have my dads conversation where he denies nothing but blames me for everything. So many people that I loved, when I stopped talking to my mom, stopped talking to me too. I know she’s been lying about why we’re not in contact… would it be too malicious to set the story straight?

You're lying in an ICU bed with cancer and multiple brain bleeds. I'm trying so hard to keep your dog happy and your house clean and my job happy and my house clean and talk with your doctors and make it all work... but i just found out I'm pregnant a few years before i meant to be. Dad and the rest of the family are all gone, there's no one to tell but you and i don't want you to be more stressed and worry about me while you're fighting for your life. My boyfriend just bought a beautiful ring, exalt what i always wanted, and were looking at our dream houses and thinking up baby names but all i can think of is how i don't want to upset you and how weird it would be to feel happy right now. I know I'm loved but i feel so alone.

698,I have a tribe? When did that happen?,"I have been posting here on a off in the last few years so I can bounce thoughts off of ""normal"" people and share stuff that occupies my mind. Today is one of those days that I feel the need to just kind of share stuff and hope you folks are willing to be the bounce-off-ees. 

When you check my profile pic you'll see an absolutely gorgeous German Shepherd. He is a service dog in training for PTSD and I am going to take my country's certification in a few months. Last weekend we travelled to another city to meet a trainer and friend to get the pre-cert testing done. A barrage of tests and stuff to do that need to be documented and sent in to be allowed to take the cert at all. It was very hard work, long hours and some stuff tapped right into my PTSD. 

Everyone, my trainer and friend, her trainee, another trainer and friend who came along mostly to take his cert but also help me, my partner, they all stuck together with the goal of helping me through this stuff. 

There are a few things missing so I called a fellow sailor friend if he could help me get a test done we couldn't do there. We need horses or sheep for a test, he has two miniature horses and said I could use them for my test. Next thing I know he starts helping me plan more training sessions in other things I'd mentioned a while ago. His wife and kid are happy to help. 

A few weeks ago I got a call from a strange number, a gamer friend's dad, asking me to secretly supply a block of fabric to her baby quilt. I did that to the best of my ability. 

It's just so... odd... belonging to people and them wanting me in their life and them supporting me like that. Feels like this is kind of like a tribe, or maybe even family? I did have relatives and still have a sister (rest is dead), but this feels so easy and caring, I can't even really describe how touched and confused I am.",w4f4xg,474,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/w4f4xg/i_have_a_tribe_when_did_that_happen/
699,"Momma, I need your advice on what to say to my 5 year old daughter that I gave up for adoption.","I know my real mom has only been gone for about a year and a half... but my daughter is now old enough to start remembering these calls and interactions a bit and I just want to make sure I help her feel loved even though she's got two amazing Dads that adopted her and have given her everything. 

For context, I got pregnant after a hookup with a guy I was friends with in high school, but hadn't seen in almost a decade. We only had sex once and we wore protection and I even took a plan b afterwards (which I recently learned isn't effective for women over 150lbs but I didn't know that).

Anyway, sure enough I ended up pregnant anyway. I never wanted children. And even if I did, the ""dad"" turned out to be a pretty useless guy who didn't help pr support me at all. Only pressured me to get an abortion. But I didn't have the money for it. For context, I got an email with notice of eviction the day after I gave birth to her, while recovering in the hospital. That's just one of a hundred other things that was going on at the time. But mostly... I just didn't want to raise a baby. I can't take care of myself let alone someone else. That's what it boiled down to. I've struggled with depression and ptsd and drug addiction.

Anyway... these two married men from California (I found them through a website for people seeking to adopt) were ready to start a family. So we met and they were at the hospital as I prepared for my c section. They were cautious. Afraid to get excited in case i changed my mind. But they say, the moment they began to feel safe that this really was going to be their baby was when the doctor came back with the baby right after they wheeled me into my room to recover and I said ""no, she should go to her parents "" and I pointed to them. 

They've been a happy family for just over 5 years. They give her everything. And a few times a year, we do video calls so that she can continue to get to know me as she grows and I can see how she's doing. 

But momma... I'm really not sure what to ask her about. 

They are amazing men and very kind. They don't judge me and they understand that I struggle with my mental health so I'm not always very available. But today is mother's day and I need to be available so she can speak to me on video and talk to her birth mother on mother's day. 

What do I say to her? She's getting older now, finally old enough to say things back to me and understand what I'm saying and I just want her to know that I care and to grow up not wondering who I am. 

Please moms. Please help me with what to say to her. What to ask her. And what to say to her parents. I want her to know I love her and I don't want her to know I'm in pain. 

Thank you, moms. Happy mothers day. 🌻

UPDATE:  our video call just ended. It went really well. We laughed and talked the whole time. She showed me her Pokémon book and we talked about our favorite Pokémon (so glad they're a thing again, I LOVED them as a kid). She showed me some dances and told me about her friends on the soccer team, and told me silly knock knock jokes, and made up a silly song about sticky bubblegum. She's healthy and smart and has a lot of interests. She's confident and extremely loved and cared for. I'm so grateful for her parents and the life they've given her and thanks to some advice from yall and advice my mom gave me before she died, I was able to ask questions and keep her relatively engaged without too much trouble. I really hope these moments build up over time to create a positive impression of me so that she knows her birth mother loves her and still always wanted to be a part of her life. In case anything happens to me and I'm not around... I just hope these memories help her to feel loved.

He’s having a very hard time living away from his parents and “feels bored” living with just me. He calls his mom everyday, and goes home EVERY SINGLE weekend (an hour drive). Couple of weeks, he’d be home from weds-Sunday, so I only see him Monday and Tuesday. One time he even got mad at me that I won’t come spend every weekend at his parents house even though we have our own apartment. I told him I don’t think that’s healthy to do that because he needs to learn to be independent and also save gas money you know? He told me that “he’s not used to having responsibilities and miss his mom cooking for him everyday.” I feel completely blindsided bc I thought at 25, you’d be happy to move out and continue a new chapter in life - especially if you can afford it! I don’t know if I’m harsh in telling him to grow up…?

714,Hey Mom. I failed the Heimlich Maneuver Today,"Hello Moms. I was walking through the teacher lounge the other and one of the office aides seemed to be in distress. I asked if she was okay and she did the universal sign for choking. Obviously I asked first if she needed help and she emphatically nodded. Now because I'm a teacher, I have made it a purposeful point to have my CPR and first-aid certifications, but I've never actually had to do it live before. I got into position and tried. It did not work. So I tried a few more times and it still wasn't working. The aide was panicking, so I yelled for someone to help me. A coworker ran to the nurse's office and they immediately showed up and were able to help her, so everything ended up okay in the end.

But I have randomly crying since it happened and I feel like such a failure. I thought that I was prepared for this kind of event, but when it was time to perform I failed and it could have ended so badly. The way she was so terrified, my ""help"" not actually helping, and how almost effortlessly the nurses were able to take care of it so easily feels like such a crushing weight on me right now. I can't stop thinking about how it could have been a kid, who should absolutely be able to have complete trust and confidence in me, and how I could have not been able to save them.

I don't have any relationship with my mother, and I haven't told my wife because I don't want her to think that I'm not manly and strong (which is toxic I know) and I don't feel like I deserve it because I wasn't able to help, but could you please tell me that I did a good job?

I saw a psychiatrist last year. She’s a wonderful lady who has put me on some anxiety medication and antidepressants. This gave me the boost to start dealing with how Covid had affected my health - both mental and physical. And I started therapy in January.  

I am a hoarder, mom. Saying it out loud is painful. I’m ashamed and mortified of the way I am. It’s embarrassing. I don’t like what I do. I don’t like how I am. 

My therapist says the medication I’m on will help me deal with it with the help of therapy. And it’s helping. I’m trying. It’s still crazy hard. But I’m working on it, day by day, because I want to change. I want to be a better and stronger person. And I’m hoping for success.

I'm finally reading Harry Potter!

I'm on the second book now and it's so much fun!  I love all the little details in the stories, all the funny bits, the events and surroundings, and all the magical things that happen, plus of course all the great friendships between Harry, Hermione, Ron and the other lovable characters such as Dumbledore and Hagrid.

It feels nice to be able to just read for fun and not be told that it's a waste of time or that the only thing worth reading are business or educational books.  It's nice not having that kind of pressure anymore that dad used to give to me growing up, although I do appreciate he was trying to help me and he didn't really understand the joys of reading entertaining books back then.

I know you'll understand that it's nice to just live and enjoy. And I also learn loads about life from these as a bonus.

719,I’m sorry but I can’t see you anymore,"Mom, you waited outside of my house for hours yesterday saying that my dad said you can have me on weekends. We both knew that wasn’t true but you knew he was on a business trip and would be too busy to deny that. You tried to get my real mom to argue with you when I wouldn’t go because you know how much I hate to see you two fight.

After almost 4 hours of waiting I told you I’d go with you for a few hours twice a month under the condition that you stop harassing us, stop trying to fight with my mom, and stop talking shit about my mom. You agreed so I went to your house with your husband and his five kids that I’ve only met once. I was uncomfortable the whole time so I sat on my bunk with the curtain drawn and texted my mom until dinner. 

Then after dinner your oldest stepson tried to unhook my bra and grabbed my butt. I punched him in the nose and ended up breaking his nose, my real mom taught me to do that, and kneed him. Your husband saw what happened and hit me. I don’t know if it was once or twice but now I have a busted lip and there’s a huge bruise on the side of my face.

743,After 18 years in prison I don’t know how the world works anymore and it makes me sad because I feel like I missed out on so much and will never fit in because of it,"Went in at 17 years old for 3 armed robbery charges and was tried as a adult and found guilty on all 3 charges. 18 years later I was out and now I’ve been out for 6 months and I’m 36 now, so I’ve technically spent half my life in prison. I don’t fit in anywhere, people my age have wives/girls friends, established careers, own there own house and car, ect. Me? Never had any friends or girlfriends, got my first job at 35 and I’m still doing it and that’s being a barista, I rent a one bedroom apartment with no furniture and don’t even have a drivers license. So in most senses I’m behind, I’m not mad about it just sad. I feel like with people my age I fail to connect with them at every level, I went in at 17 and never really progressed much past a 17 year old I guess you could say. 


I’m on probation for 8 years still and that means I can’t drink, can’t be out of the house past 9pm, can’t leave the state, have to wear a ankle monitor 24-7, not allowed to have pets. So I have a lot of restrictions which don’t really allow me to have a social life or a life at all really. I remember at a dinner party I had to beg the host to drive me home so I wouldn’t violate curfew and even had to show him my monitor which was embarrassing to say the least. 

Though I’m out of prison I don’t feel like I have much more freedom than I did. If I want to travel I have to notify my PO and then he has to notify the monitoring company about where exactly I’m going to be staying and for how long. At this point it’s easier to just not to travel past my small town of 11k people 

I know this is ranty but I’m just tired of it all. I just want a normal quiet life. Also sorry about the bad English I more or less taught myself

746,"Mom, I fell for a guy with a big secret.","I met an incredible guy I met online after 7 years of being a divorced single Mom. I’ve been guarded and careful and finally felt I truly found someone I could easily give trust and honesty to and could see a real future with. 

He told me a couple of weeks into dating that he had a “maybe baby” situation from a weird tinder hookup and the baby is due in 2-3 months. That it was between he and one other guy and that paternity would be found out when baby was 3-5 days old. This was of course a HUGE thing for me to take into consideration but his approach to telling me and the countless valuable conversations we had about this potential factor put my mind at ease mostly. He is a divorced single father of two very littles and the dynamic with his ex wife as he had been explaining it, was off to me though. He told me he got full custody of the kids because of a history of DV from the ex wife. But that he also still allows the ex wife to see the kids frequently (supposedly ex wife had met certain criteria laid out in the divorce that allowed this to happen) and that he fully financially supports her still, because he didn’t want anything to change for his kids with the divorce. This part is wild to me as I know pretty much exclusively dead beat dads. So I’ve asked a lot of questions. And his answers seemed to always lead to more questions.

Tonight everything came to a head. We took a trip to Denver together over the weekend and had briefly discussed how neither of us are very into social media and prefer to be more private about our lives. I don’t typically post about vacation while I’m there anyway and I rarely share details on who I was with. But he did show me his Facebook. What I could see about it matched everything he had told me. He has an android phone and me an apple so while exchanging photos we took of the trip noticed they came in fuzzy. So I said oh usually when that happens we exchange them through messenger. So right in front of me he searched for my name on messenger but only my insta came up. Which was weird but I said oh yeah I keep it pretty locked down but you can send them there too. And he does. And in the messages there’s an option to view his fb profile. Which up to this point I had not considered stalking him since it’s not really my style but I clicked anyway. It took me to Facebook but nothing happened. Like a broken link. So I tell my bestie who happens to be a social specialist in her job so shes like sis I’ll start digging. She finds his profile. Nothing weird. Everything checks out. But why can she see him and I can’t. We test a few things and come to the conclusion that I’m blocked. But why? Why show me it exists but block me from it. My spidery senses are tingling that what if ex wife is the one pregnant with “maybe baby”. 

So I confront him. Am I blocked from your Facebook and if so why? So he supposedly comes clean with the explanation that yes, ex wife is pregnant. But it’s not his baby. But because it happened around the time of their divorce with a random druggie dude, the easiest thing for everyone is to adopt this child as his and continue co parenting with ex and two babes. 

I’m obviously BLINDSIDED. I don’t know if trust could be there again because of the elaborate stories he concocted about the whole thing. His explanation is that he didn’t know when we first met that he would fall for me and that if he had known he would meet someone amazing, he wouldn’t have made this arrangement and he knows it’s asinine, all of it. But he is truly an amazing Dad who always wanted a huge family and has now his kids since had a vasectomy and won’t have another opportunity at a baby with anyone. I think it’s admirable if it’s actually the truth, and that could have been something that wasn’t a deal breaker for me, had it not been built on a lie.

I know what needs to be done and it sucks because he is incredible in every single possible way. If you made it this far into my spiral, thank you. I don’t have anyone I can be honest about this situation with because most of my people didn’t know I was even seeing someone.",x34ctx,413,123,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/x34ctx/mom_i_fell_for_a_guy_with_a_big_secret/

760,"Hi Mommy, I had to walk away from a guy I really liked. Did I do the right thing?","Hi Mumma,

I have always found dating really hard, and can never catch a break. I met this guy 7 weeks ago on a night out and instantly hit it off. We went on dates, spoke deeply, had great chemistry

Yesterday I asked him how he felt about us and what things looked like for us. He said he wants to make sure before getting into a relationship and taking things slow. I was fine with that, but when I asked about at least dating exclusively he said he isnt seeing or sleeping with anyone but if someone asked him for a drink he’d like the freedom of being able to go. I didnt know what to reply to that and he cuddled me harder and said you’re going to break up with me aren’t you.

I messaged him today to say I am happy to taking things slow but exclusivity is important to me. And if he doesnt want that I am going to have to walk. He doesnt. So although I really really like him, and he likes me too apparently I have to walk away.

It sucks so bad mumma, I can’t catch a break with dating just need a virtual hug and to be told its all going to be ok

Thankyou mummas, I so appreciate you all

4/4/22 @ 3:00pm: The doctor let Dad and I know that I’ll be getting discharged around 4pm today to go home. 

4/4/22 @ 7:00am: I’m finally more awake and not so groggy. (Also laughed at the typos in the update from 2:30am). They have me on pain medicine and are going to let me try to eat later this morning with plans to let me go home later this afternoon/night. My Dad was allowed to stay with me all night and he still is with me. I’m not in any pain currently I’m just extremely tired. I’ll keep checking in whenever I can.

4/4/22 @ 2:35 am: I’m out of surgerY. I’m groggy but I’m ok. I’ll update..magain later.. i’M goinG back to sleep fr. A bit.

4/3/22 @ 11:45pm: They found a ruptured cyst on my right ovary. They’re prepping me for emergency surgery in the next 20-30 minutes. They told me and Dad it’ll be about 1.5-2hours for them to clean up the remnants of the cyst and stop the bleeding. They also said there is no reason for them to believe that it’s cancer as the results of half of my bloodwork has been coming back fine.

4/3/22 @ 11pm: Dad has brought me to the ER, they have me in a room finally and are going to give me some pain meds and do some bloodwork and an ultrasound. Bloodworm to check for infection or cancer signs, and ultrasound to check for cysts. I’ll update when I know more.


My Mom passed away September 25, 2021 so I unfortunately can’t ask her. 

I’m a 17 year old female, and it’s just me and Dad (64M) in the house. My brothers are all moved out and married (they’re 41, 40, 39 and 37). 

I tried to text me one sister in law and she didn’t answer, and I tried a bunch of things I saw on Google which I’ve listed below. 

I’ve never had cramps this bad in my entire life but I also was 12 days late this month (0 chance of pregnancy since I’ve never slept with anyone before). 

What can I do for cramps that are so painful I want to cry?  Also should I tell my Dad that I was this late and I’m in this much pain? (I don’t want to tell him but it freaks me out) 

Things I’ve tried:
1. Heating pad 
2. Hot bath
3. Midol 
4. Took my dog for a walk

764,Happy angel day mom!,"I made it out to the cemetery this morning to draw an angel on the back of your headstone, I hope you like it. As of today it’s 28 years you’ve been gone, crazy right? Your baby boy turns 29 in three weeks, and he’s been missing you soo much lately. I feel so lost without you, I always have. I feel like nothing I have ever done has ever felt like anything more than just something to do to pass the time; an activity to occupy my mind while I await my inevitable death. Mom, I hope I’m not being too honest when I say I have spent most of my life waiting for it to be over, only looking forward to the peace of no longer being on this plane of existence… I am getting tired of waiting mom, so very very tired. So many nights I spend wishing I could give you a hug, be held in your arms, hear your voice, but we will never get to share those experiences, and that absolutely crushes me.

Grandma passed back in february, and it’s been getting harder and harder ever since. She did soooo much for me after you passed, she tried sooo hard to make sure I’d turn out alright. She did everything she could for me, heck when I was in 5th grade, she even did my homework for me! As she got older, and I was the last one around (youngest), I got a chance to try to pay her back by doing my best to help her be able to stay in her home as long as possible. I wasn’t perfect, maybe not even great, but I hope I did well enough. I wish I could have done half as much for her as she did for me, and I know I should have visited her more while she was in the nursing home at the end (in my defense there was a global plaugue.) But now, with her gone I don’t know what I want to do with my life, material possessions mean so little to me, and achievements feel hollow. Grandma left me $60k to go to school with as long as I start by my 30th birthday. I know I should,  I know she’d want me to, I know you’d want me to, I know it’s the smart thing to do, and I most likely will do it. But I have no reason to believe it will make me happy, I don't think anything ever will, because no matter how much money I make, no matter what I accomplish in my life, all I’m ever gonna want is my mommy 😢

Despite being a grown woman (27 y.o), before tonight, I'd never been penetrated—not by another person, not by a tampon, nothing. The idea of it always scared me and it scared me a lot worse when I tried to get a pap smear in college and had to call it off because the pain was too intense.

I have another pap smear scheduled for Saturday and I'm determined to see it through this time. So over the past couple of weeks, I've been experimenting with penetration. Up to today, I've had the same result: I stick one fingertip inside, angled up towards my neck, and very quickly hit a painful wall. It really scared me because I thought something must be in the way, like an abnormal growth or something.

Well, today, I tried again, but this time, I decided to be a little more open-minded about the angle. To my utter shock, I got my whole finger in there without any pain at all—but only by angling it to be pointed more toward my butt.

I feel both very relieved and very confused right now. On one hand—penetration without pain is possible! Hooray!!. On the other hand... what?! Is it supposed to be like that? I always thought that the vaginal canal is supposed to be more or less vertical, pointing from the groin up toward the neck. But then, I've never actually watched porn or anything, so I guess I wouldn't know.

782,Advice for a seriously shocked and confused partner,"Hey Moms, I really never thought I'd be making a post like this ever. Using a throwaway, but I need your advice. For the past two years, I've been dating the guy I'd call the love of my life. We were best friends before dating, he's always been so sweet and considerate and loving, which is why I'm so confused.

Over the past few weeks, at the tail end of two years, he's been getting... meaner. He yelled at me in my own home, threatening to leave. He apologized. Then we had an argument a few days ago, and it ended when we both went to sleep. He had been condescending, and getting mean. I didn't want to talk to him a lot the next day. I gave him an update on my day when he asked, but he didn't respond. Later, when he called me and asked what was wrong, I told him that I'd tried explaining the night before that he'd been condescending and he only got angrier and meaner the more I tried to explain what I meant. Cue fight #2. He's angry and gradually wears me down over the course of two hours on the phone, at which point I'm in full on tears because I don't understand where all of this is coming from and I'd just finished studying for two hours, which I told him. He started saying things like ""I can't make you do anything"" but also ""Don't you dare hang up the phone"", and ""Why are you crying?"" . He started yelling at me and punching his pillow, and when I asked him about it he said he needed to let off frustration. Again, he apologized later.

Then today, I tried to tell him that what he did, the punching the pillow and making demands like ""Don't you dare hang up the phone"" and stuff really scared me. He started saying how he wasn't a scary guy. that I had no reason to be scared, that I was being irrational, etc.

Moms, where the hell did this come from? He wasn't like this just three months ago. Over the past few weeks he's just been getting meaner and not at all acting like himself. Does anyone have any experience with anything like this? I'm so lost, and confused, I don't understand how someone's personality can just do a 180.

He’s 34 and I’m 25. We really got on. We moved things over to WhatsApp and I was very shocked to see his photo. He looked a lot older than his photos on the app.

It’s mixed opinions at the moment where some of my friends agree and some disagree. Overall, I feel uncomfortable with the photo I see on WhatsApp - hes wearing sunglasses so it could be hard to judge but I just think his dating app photos are 3 years younger or so.

I’m not attracted to him and I now want to somehow cut communications but I don’t know how to turn him down.

I feel bad because we got on and some people are saying to give him a chance as I’ve never actually met/seen him. 

He’s also just asked me what my turn ons are and I feel uncomfortable given I haven’t met him and I also mentioned I hold out for a while - I made a point to tell him this because he’s older and I don’t know what he’s looking for.

I also asked him what his deal breakers were because I was trying to set the conversation up so that I could try end things. He just said his deal breaker was if someone wasn’t kind/toxic.

its just a stupid complicated situation. 

my partner wants to remain friends with the ex and their ex has BPD (so do i) so my partner is not allowed to talk to me while they are hanging with the ex, because the ex hates me and it triggers their bpd, but I just gotta deal with it.

the ex also had a restraining order out on my partner and is holding that over their head so they won't stop talking to the ex. 

they fight with eachother a lot and say some horrible things to eachother and have done some horrible things im just so confused why they would want to continue a friendship with their ex who has been so horrible and volatile. 

and then when my partner hangs out with me they're just on their phone the whole time or is playing games. just feels bad and idk whether or not I'm over reacting.


edit/// 

Tysm for all the responses and concern! Its given me a lot to think about.

Some extra context, they are getting money, an apple watch and shoes from the ex out of this. They are also helping the ex move stuff and take them to and from therapy. I should see my partner soon.

I was able to get through to them for an hour yesterday, and talk to them about this stuff I have issues with. They were really receptive and concerned about my negative feelings and unhappiness with whats going on. 

They still have the excuse that things keep getting better with the ex so they're going to keep trying, and they they don't hate me necessiarly but they hate the situation. Personally I don't think there will ever be a day where the ex could be civil with me but whatever. 

They are talking to the ex about the texting thing, I'm going to push this one more because that sort of thing triggers my BPD too but I don't make it other peoples problem, I use my coping skills to handle it. 

Explanation on the RO. It is there and it is active. The reasoning i got was that the ex was keeping the RO so my partner couldn't manipulate the ex which makes no sense to me, because in turn that means my partner is being manipulated. I think if they took this to court with evidence it could be removed. 

And the phone/video game thing, we talked about that too, they said they will try and cut back and offered a compromise that I am happy with. We shall see how things go from here I guess. 

Hope this addresses everything, feel free to ask questions. And sorry I didn't respond to everyone!

Well now I'm being sued for the balance and although I want to get all of this straightened out, I don't even know where to begin. I'm so embarrassed and scared, I don't want my partner or you to know. I just want to crawl into bed and never get out of it. I feel so dumb posting this, I guess I just needed to hear that it's going to be ok (even though it's not).

Edit: thank you all so much for your kind words. They're exactly what I needed to hear. I'm going to tell my partner tonight. While I imagine that they'll be less than enthusiastic about the situation - I need to tell them because they deserve the truth and I'd never want to do anything to hurt them/ be dishonest with them. I'm going to contact the company tomorrow (worked all day today and now they're closed) but I'm going to reach out to them so that I can get this situation under control.

My cousin just had a beautiful baby girl and one of my girlfriends is 7 weeks pregnant and I’m angry.

I want to cry and bury my face in a pillow, I know this is common but it doesn’t make it any less worse. BF and I talked about potentially trying again more sooner than we thought but agreed not trying right now was for the best until I mentally and emotionally recovered and we became more stable.

Already she’s brought some things here and I’m feeling suffocated by the amount of stuff she has. We can’t even fit our own things in the cabinets any more and her food has spilled out onto the counters for storage. My house looks messy already because there’s all these things sitting around. We lost so much counter space and she’s not even properly moved in yet. 

She’s also so, so, hateful sometimes mom. We haven’t always gotten along and I fear living under the same roof will just make it worse. She is homophobic and racist and makes fun of plus size people. I’m really bad at ignoring meanness. 

I’ve asked my husband if we can have a meeting to set ground rules about what’s appropriate in our house. He agreed, but I’m worried it’s already going to make her angry for us to give her rules. She doesn’t like responsibility and lives like there are no consequences to her actions.

796,I am worried he is going down a dangerous rabbit hole.,"My boyfriend is super sweet and super kind and absolutely amazing and I love him dearly.... but I dont think this relationship is necessarily healthy for him. We have been together for 4 months and he pretty much cries when he has to go more than a few days without seeing me even if we get to talk on the phone. He loves me, I know that, I think...  but im also the first female in his life to not take him for granted or abuse him. So I worry that it's getting to the point of codependency and that he's just getting overwhelmed with the fact that I treat him like a human being that I truly care about... and I have no clue what to do with it. How to protect him from himself, how to protect him from me, on this... I have no intention of breaking up with him... but I also need some way to make him realize he needs to stand on his own two feet both within and outside of our relationship.... 

Or is this just how a normal healthy relationship works and im so damaged that I don't see it that way? 

Any advice?

To everyone going the ""he's dangerous"" route... he isn't.I have the self confidence and boundaries I need, I've been through hell and back and don't compromise myself like that anymore. And to boot, this man doesn't have a single mean thread in his body or soul. He's the kindest most gentle person I have ever met. He didn't have a childhood tho... he was kept in a locked room with an abusive sister or made to sit in church silently for most of his life before 18. So he's a little immature and fairly innocent and a bit like a little kid just finding out how big the world really is and how to tell the good intent from the bad.  He isn't controlling in the slightest, he's infact very passive and shy. And to everyone screaming therapy... does he need it, yes, will he admit he needs it, yes, but does he have the means and time to make it a current possibility? No. Which is why I was asking for advice as to what i can do to help him find his feet.",yfrxu9,377,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/yfrxu9/i_am_worried_he_is_going_down_a_dangerous_rabbit/
797,My trauma was broadcasted on television,"I lost everything to an apartment fire a few years ago. It was the worst fire that area had seen in a very long time. Half the building collapsed. Fire alarms did not go off for hours after the fire had started. Shoddy construction lead to a nail (that shouldn't have been there) touched an exposed wire. Nobody at our apartment complex called us to let us know even after alarms started going off. We were an hour away when we were alerted by a neighbor. Our cats were inside the building. Our friend was blocked from entering the property to get them out.

By the time we got there, the entire building was engulfed in flames. The fire wasn't able to be put out until extremely late into the night. I collapsed in the dirt, watching everything my boyfriend and I built up be destroyed in front of my eyes. I was inconsolable. It was very obvious to all families outside that our cats were still inside the building. All fire fighters and police were alerted.

I turned to my right and saw a camera man from some news station pointing his camera directly at me. Looking back, it was on par with how messed up Nightcrawler was. I don't even know what happened. My friend said he was standing next to me and then I was in the guy's face screaming at him. ""I hope your mother is proud for trying to benefit off of my trauma"" basically. Two cops stepped between us, I got even more angry when they told me he had the right to film me, and eventually my friend and boyfriend came by to take me away.

Our cats were trapped in the building for 1 day and 3 days. Both were put into the ICU, one staying for a week. We lost everything right before graduating college. All we had was our cats and that's all I cared about. I have severe PTSD. I do not think I will ever be off xanax. I can't even list all of the awful things that happened *after* this happened. This would be a literal novel.

My therapist at the time watched as many news stories as possible after I broke down in his office, telling him about what had happened. He assured me he didn't personally see anything, so it was possible that I either messed up the guys shot by flipping him off and screaming at him or he had a change of heart and realized how fucked it was to be filming someone in that state. I believed that until yesterday. 

My aunt was talking about the fire yesterday. I mentioned this story and she said ""so that *was* you crying on the ground!"" Then it all came rushing back. She does not even live in this state. I don't know if she saw it online or on the news. I'm so angry. So fucking angry. That entire period of my life was so traumatizing. My therapist is going to be fucking livid when I tell him.

Tell me I have the right to be angry about this. Tell me I have the right to feel betrayed. Tell me how messed up it is for someone to use me for company profit. I want to scream.

Before anyone mentions legal action- we tried. Lawyers told us we didn't have a case. That still makes no sense to me.",vl2x7a,378,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/vl2x7a/my_trauma_was_broadcasted_on_television/

805,"Mom, I feel guilty about lying to my real mom about where I was last night.","I'm 22, in college, and living on campus. Every night, my real life mom calls me to talk about my day and to make sure that I made it home safely to my dorm, (and if I'm at a party or something, that I'm with someone and that someone would walk me back.) I go to school in a major city so it makes sense that she would care about my safety and it has never been a problem, until last night.

I recently got my first boyfriend, something my real mom doesn't know. Last night, instead of being in my dorm, I was in his dorm, and I spent the night there. I know my mom would be furious if she knew that I was spending the night with a guy, so when she called and asked me if I was safe in my dorm, I said that yes, I was in my dorm room, which I obviously wasn't.

This guilt is eating away at me. I mean part of it is because I lied about my location which is really bad when it comes to safety reasons. Lets say hypothetically, something bad happens to me; my mom would have no idea where I REALLY was the night before. I just feel sick to my stomach.

Yes internet mom, I know that I'm an adult but in my real mom's eyes, that doesn't matter.

810,"My sweet bumble bees! I know that everything seems so hopeless right now, but we will get through this together 💕🐝","My, sweet, sweet bumble bees. I don’t know where to begin. First, im going to warn, for the first time ever on my posts, this is going to get a little political as I will be talking about Roe V Wade. I want you ALL to be kind to one another in the comments. I raised you all to above all else to be kind to one another as the world has enough hatred as it is, we don’t need it on here. This is a safe space. If you disagree, scroll on. Mama Bee is not made of steel which is why I haven’t been able to post for a while. I love you all and remember not only does kindness cost nothing, it is contagious. 💕💕💕💕

 As some of you already know, I relocated from Southern California to the south after a devastating house fire. I’m luckily in a place that is pretty much 50/50 and in artist community so have many LGBTQ+ friends and favorite baristas I like to give little gifts to. (I’m skipping getting my nails done and buys a bunch of rainbow pins with clouds at the bottom that say “F*ck Off” because I gave my other ones away to a barista who was in tears because someone was saying some hateful things. Turns out that is the first thing they see every morning and always makes them smile. So, remember bumble bees, even the smallest gesture of kindness can have a ripple effect. Anyway, it has been quite a culture shock in that in certain parts, people are just proud of their bigotry, misogyny, transphobia, racism, etc. However, what do I always say? It isn’t that there isn’t more bad in the world than good. The bad is just louder and more obnoxious. 

 So, on to what I wanted to get into: Roe V Wade being overturned. (I’ll add in the comments of why this is such a horrible thing in case any of you are unaware.) I know we are all scared about this as our rights are being taken away and the fear is that they will next start going after gay marriage, trans people, and eventually interracial marriage. It is all really horrifying and I’ve spent a lot of time sobbing in the arms my sweet, kind, and wonderful boyfriend. (He is a psychology major and has helped me with some of you on here when it is out of my wheel house and also cares about you all so much. So you all have a mamma bee and papa bee lol) 

 So, I know this is scary and reminds me of Iran in 1978. (Please look it up with you’re unfamiliar) The thing is, now we have social media to stay up to date and actually understand what’s going on, so we have a leg up. We know we need to vote out the people that are pushing these laws. Now is the time to put our armor on. I know it is scary. I’m scared as well. But, my sweet bumble bees, you are all so strong and I’m so proud of you. You are worthy of good things and love. Do not stop fighting, my loves. We will get through this together. 

 Now, my bumble bees, I need you all to do me a favor: I need you to first take a deep breath. In and out, ok? In 1,2,3,4,5 and out 1,2,3,4,5. Next, I want you to get a cute journal with good pens and keep it by your bedside. Every night, I want you to write down 5 things you are grateful for (doesn’t have to be big! It could just be something like “I’m grateful I made the bed” or “I am grateful I did something nice for myself” even if the thing you did for yourself was just looking in the mirror and saying all the things you love about yourself. Remember that words matter and how we talk to ourselves really effects us. So be as gentle with yourself as you would your best friend. Even if you are in the depths of despair, I want you to say it. It sounds weird but this actually works and eventually you will start believing it to be true (which it is!!! )Bumble bee! You’re amazing. I know you have more good qualities than bad. But, it is kind of like you receive a million compliments and get one nasty comment by someone (usually who you wouldn’t take advice from so why take their criticism?) and that ONE mean comment will be what you focus on. The other thing I want you to do is give yourself a reset. For me, I love this passion fruit iced tea from Starbucks and chat with my favorite baristas for a moment. That always seems to help and it is something I do just for me. The last thing is this: do something kind for someone else. It doesn’t have to be huge or cost anything. Remember we never know what someone is going through. Also, studies have shown that helping others or volunteering boosts serotonin so it is a win win! What I like to do is if I go to a restaurant or a coffee shop, I’ll pull the “anti karen” and ask for the manager. (Literally did this yesterday) I tell them how wonderful that person was and then say “ya, they need a little treat like a gift card or a pony lol”. If any of you have worked in the service industry, you know how much this helps. Even writing on the bill “excellent service” helps them out more than you know and it is easy, free, and just a small gesture that can make someone’s day or even week!

 I love you all so much. It is going to be ok and we will get through this together. Don’t let anyone dull your sparkle because we need your light in this world. 

I’m here if you need me. I try to respond as quickly as I can, but I have quite a lot of bumble bees that PM me and I try to get back to everyone as quickly as I can while also making sure that I give you my full attention. I love you all so very much💕🐝💕🐝",vmo7ag,375,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/vmo7ag/my_sweet_bumble_bees_i_know_that_everything_seems/

I know it's not always sunshine and rainbows. Life comes fast, it hits hard, and you get knocked down. It's not fair, but you are still standing, and that's what matters. 

You are irreplaceable, and you matter. The world is a better place with you in it.
You are powerful.
You are valid.
You are enough.
And anyone that thinks otherwise doesn't deserve the privilege of being in your life.

It's been so rough, and you've had to be so strong, but you are immensely capable, and I can't wait to see the castle you build out of all of this rubble.

I was afraid to share it because I didn’t want to be judged, it was already super hard mentally but y’all been great so thank you. Yesterday after work I asked my grandfather to drop me off at a walk in clinic and got myself tested. My grandfather is the only person I trust and he waited for me on the parking and didn’t try to know why I went there which I’m thankful because even though he’s definitely the best person around, he isn’t as open minded as I wish he was. Anyway I got tested and should get the results Tuesday, they didn’t give me pre-exposure-prophylaxis though. I’m super worried now and hope everything is okay.

Also pretty much everybody mentioned to report him, when I wrote that post I didn’t know about statutory rape and your comments opened my eyes on how bad it really was, I really thought that I was to blame. But right now reporting him is impossible because my step mother would take that opp to kick me out. My family know that I’m gay but that’s one of those things that we don’t talk about because they don’t approve it, only my step mother mentions it but that’s always as a insult. If it was just me I wouldn’t care to be kicked out but I have two little brothers and no one else care about them except for me and can’t let them alone with her. I’m really sorry for the possible future victims but right now I really can’t.

After I made my original post, I felt so much relief to get it off my chest.

834,"Mom, I publicly admitted I’m pro-choice today despite being terrified you would attempt to disown me again","Years ago when I made it known that I supported gay marriage, you attempted to sever my relationship with you and the rest of my family. 

You called me and asked if I wanted to go out for ice cream. I was so excited to see you. You never wanted to hang out. I got all dressed up and hoped you’d notice my outfit when I got into your car. But I could tell immediately that something was off. You looked cold and angry. 

As you drove you started to tell me that you saw my Facebook post about supporting gay marriage. You said you’d talked to dad and decided that unless I agreed to repent and come back to church, I’d not be allowed to see or talk to you, my dad, my brother or anyone else in the family. You threw a piece of paper at me with a list of the names of our mutual friends on Facebook. You said I had humiliated you and that I was to delete every name on the list immediately. 

I sat there quietly fighting back tears as you yelled at me. And then you dropped me off two miles from my house and told me to walk home. 

Weeks later you finally called me and apologized. You blamed it on menopause. I told you it was okay and I tried to move on from it. But I have never forgotten. 

That day is the reason I have been fully hiding my true self and my true beliefs and opinions to this day. You still think I’m a Christian. You still think a lot of things about me that aren’t true. 

And today I publicly voiced for the first time that I am furiously and compassionately pro choice. 

I’m afraid of what you could say or do. I’m 32 years old now and still terrified to be myself in front of you. I’m terrified to be myself in front of ANYONE because of you.

835,Third day of school and the kiddo is in the hospital getting stitches. I am FREAKED out.,"Hello moms. :c 

To be forward, I am not kiddos mom, I’m the aunt, but have been the main caregiver for going on sixteen months. (His dad works nights, so I watch him during the day, save for two days a week where he’s at his moms.) 

As you could probably see, in that time, I have grown as attached as I assume a mom could be. I love him so much. Like my own. 

His dad just sent me three pictures of him in the hospital with no context, showing a large slit leaving his mouth. (I hate to put it this way, but think Joker-eque.) I instantly called him. He said they’re in the hospital because he needs stitches, and the preschool says he “fell into a bookcase.” 

The thing is, that slit is so clean, it doesn’t look like a fall. It looks like he was left with scissors or a box cutter or something. I even forwarded it to a couple close friends who ASKED if he was left alone with scissors or if another kid got him with scissors. I can’t tell if I’m more freaked out (or jumping to conclusions because I’m so upset) by that, or the fact that he won’t even eat when he so much as bites his lip. I can’t even imagine having stitches along the opening of your mouth. He split his lip a week ago and it took almost three days for him to eat like normal. 

I’m really upset. :c I know kids get hurt, but this is his first “big one.” He just turned four less than a month ago. At his last daycare he sprained his ankle and they didn’t even call us, so my trust issues are off the charts.

**EDIT:** 

An unhappy edit for the most part. If you didn’t read my comment below, the school did not call an ambulance nor the parents. (It is a preschool, not a daycare.) 

I had already told his parents that the school failed him, that they needed to get an incident report, that they need to ask for camera footage, etc.  How they failed as the caregivers of my nephew. Unfortunately, both parents are giving me the “he should have been listening and doing what he’s supposed to do, it isn’t the schools fault, it’s his,” line. That breaks my heart even further. I feel alone in the ‘parental,’ instincts. 

I cannot ask or demand the school for these things. I have no actual guardianship, I’m just a full time nanny outside of school; I don’t even have permission to pick him up or drop him off. I don’t even know where it is. However, when I get the name out of a parent, I believe I’ll try to report it online or through a phone call if possible. 

The parents are just going the hard assed route. I’m so terribly sad. I did chew them out about this being their babies first “big,” incident and they’re acting like it’s a “lesson,” as if this costs them anything. It doesn’t, kiddo is insured. They’re just inconvenienced by the waiting room. The school “didn’t call,” because it was pick up time anyway, and they just waited for a parent. I still believe that was fully wrong, and I still do not believe the bookshelf story. He isn’t even tall enough to hit the corner of a bookshelf, which is the only thing that would be sharp enough to make such a straight cut. There’s no bruising around it either. It just doesn’t seem like a blunt force incident to me. 


He luckily did not need stitches in the corner of his mouth, but his top lip does have three stitches. He was in the waiting room from 2:30 and finally just got them at 9:00pm. They did not sedate him. I’m so, so sad.

They had a three hour blocking and choreography practice this morning to prepare for competition season and when she got home she told us that they didn’t block her, that she’s considered a swing. I’m big mad. This is her last year, she’s worked as hard as anyone for that choir program. I have to pay almost $1k just for her to be in the show choir not to mention incidentals like dance shoes, tights, makeup, hair and travel and performance tickets (and each show costs us a minimum of $40 just to attend -$10 each for myself, my husband/her father, our daughter and my mom, some venues charge more). And this is the first time anyone has heard anything about there being swing positions. I personally have volunteered to help with the choir every single year since she got to high school and have never been taken up on my offer despite them begging for volunteers before and after every show.

841,Need help with using tampons,"Hey mom, 

I have spent most of my teenage years using pads (as it is customary in my country) but I've always detested the design of it. I would always be left with bloody underwear and soiled bedsheets even when my flow was quite little. 

So naturally, I have decided to give tampons a shot but I didnt realise how horribly painful the whole experience would be. 

Putting it in was the first challenge but usually I find a way to cram it in there despite the initial pain of fitting it in. Sometimes, a little bit of the tampon will jut out and I just cant push it up no matter how much I try. The blood just ends up seeping through my underwear. 

Once it is in there, it is a pretty seamless pain-free experience. I keep trying to use tampons just because of the actual experience of them in me. 

However, the biggest challenge is removing the tampon. It takes me about an hour and way too much wincing to yank it out. The whole thing is sooooo painful and it just feels like the tampon is stuck up there which just gives me more anxiety.

I hate pads with a burning passion, tampons are just straight up too painful to remove and putting a menstrual cup up there is a whole different level of anxiety. 

What should I do mom? I do want to keep using tampons but I dont think it should hurt this much :(",r82pa1,349,154,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/r82pa1/need_help_with_using_tampons/

But now I’m worried everything will be against the inspection so I stripped it back down to how it was.","It feels so cold and lonely again. 

I get depressed not seeing the little trinkets that bring me enough joy to get through the day. I figured if this was gonna be a hard journey, at least my unit could be a safe space to decompress and regulate. Self care practices and comfy cozy vibes.

(I’m on the spectrum so curating my space to feel cozy/safe was important to me.)

You’d be so proud mom. I scrubbed every corner of this place and decorated it as my little sanctuary away from all the pain. Finally having my own space and I treated it like a warm sanctuary that invites you in with relaxing vibes.

I got excited thinking about showing people around during the inspection. Thinking that they would appreciate the thought and care in all the detail.

But I’m realizing they won’t care about that. They just want to see that everything is clean and up to their expectations. And I could be penalized or discharged if it doesn’t.

Unit inspection is once a week so it’s not like I can put things back after inspection. I’m not even sure if my stuff was against the code. But I don’t know what to expect and I don’t wanna risk losing shelter over this.

Moments like these make me miss my old space. At least there I could express my personality on my 4 bedroom walls and tables. I was enveloped in my self love in that little room. 

Now I’m just cold, tired, and lonely again. I really hope it gets better from here. I’m struggling to see this through

Edit: Hi everyone. I'm sorry for the late response. I've been processing a lot and unfortunately I tend to isolate when I'm depressed.

i cant explain how much each and everyone of your comments mean to me. the thought and support behind all of this. I didn't think anyone would see it. Thank you all so much for taking the time to talk to me and comfort me. Giving me advice and encouragement. I've been extremely anxious lately and this was one of those days.

I'm happy to report that the inspection was less that 5 minutes and went well. They even commented on how clean and neat everything is. Like a lot of you suggested,I asked about how much I can decorate and they told me the same. as long as it was nothing that would leave marks on the wall or obstruct areas,i could decorate as wanted. I put most things back but there's still a hesitancy to settle in too much again. today was another inspection and I got up early to clean and rearrange again.

854,Mom I spent my first night in a foster care,"I met with a social worker and showed her proofs of abuse (mainly texts where she states what she did/ threaten me etc) from my mother, she got in contact with a judge who agreed to get me an temporary placement in a youth center for now. I always been afraid of doing it so instead I have been through hell but I know I need to get my shit together for my baby. In this center, I have my own room with a small closet and a sink. I have a lock on my door which I’m grateful for. I have to admit it feels good not having to worry where I’m gonna spend the night like I did for so long.

After talking to the planned parenthood lady and the social worker, I’m pretty sure to have a place in a mother - baby center once I reach 7 months pregnant but this is only possible if the judge keeps me in foster care or my mother has to give her consent if she gets cleared in the investigation which she won’t so I hope they wont believe her BS.

this placement would mean everything to me because it is specially made to help out young mother, it would give me the opportunity to do my apprenticeship without having to worry about childcare and would give the stability my baby need.  I would have my own place with a bedroom, kitchen and living area and bath.

859,Mom am I wrong here ?,"honestly need some outside opinions on this. I had an argument with my dad about this and I'm feeling pretty upset. 

Here is the argument: My husband and I are ignoring medical debt until it can no longer be collected and falls off our credit report. My dad thinks its morally wrong of us to not pay the hospital. 

So here is the context: 
 My husband had a terrible accident when we were 20 years old and needed emergency  surgery.  We live in the USA and were without health insurance at the time. 

We applied to Medicaid and were denied because we were overdue with the paperwork that we weren't receiving until after the due dates had past. We tried going to the Medicaid office several times. 

When we were ultimately  denied because of clerical hang ups we were told to do the hospitals program for low income families. 

They said a caseworker would come to our house to help with the paperwork and scheduled it, but they never came. They then conveniently ""lost"" all records of our paperwork that we had given them. They didnt give a chance to resubmit the paperwork.  Then they denied us and sent us a bill for $50,000.  

At the time I was working 3 jobs and going to school full time while caring for my injured husband. I was choosing between rent and food on the table. When I asked my family for assistance  they said no, not because they couldn't help but to teach me a lesson. 

So during this time my husband's family advised me to ignore the debt, never acknowledge it ever, and that if we did that for 7 years they wouldn't be able to make us pay. We are now past the point that the hospital can sue us for the money and still havent acknowledged the debt, but it will be 2 years before it drops off the credit report. 

Am I morally wrong for not paying the hospital? I was just acting on the only advice that had been given to me. I had done everything they asked of me but I believe they purposely screwed us over. 

 I couldn't afford the payments then and we still cant afford the payments now. I feel that it's a gray area but my dad thinks I'm wrong and that I'm ""stealing"". 

I dont know how to feel about all this. Mom what do you think?",wbdqsn,340,106,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/wbdqsn/mom_am_i_wrong_here/

i told him that i felt masturbation was good for you, and that he had nothing to be ashamed of. but this cycle of guilt continued. fast forward to today, and he’s at the gym. he’s sending me pictures of his arms and legs and i said “do i get to see your abs today? ;)” because he had sent me shirtless pics before. he then never responded. i text him again awhile later and said “did i upset you?” and he said “no” and that was it. 

i then ask “are you sure? i feel like i did. i’m sorry if me asking for a picture made you uncomfortable.” and he said “i just need people around me who encourage me to choose the right.” and i was like oh okay. i apologized again and said “i’m sorry, i didn’t mean to upset you. you’ve just sent me shirtless pics in the past, i didn’t realize it would make you feel that way.” and all he said was “it’s fine.” i then said something like “i’m sorry that you feel this way. i don’t think we’re a good match tho if you’re going to continue to feel guilty about your sexuality, and wanting someone else to control how you act upon it. i wish you all the best.” he then replies “first off, i never expected you to control my thoughts. secondly, you’re being very manipulative rn and it sucks to see your true colors come out. and i really liked you too. good luck in the future.” i didn’t respond and i just blocked the number. 

i’m not sure why but it made me really upset. i never tried to manipulate how he felt about anything. i was just tired of the constant guilt cycle he put himself in for feeling normal feelings. i always tried to help him out but i realized after awhile it wouldn’t change. this dude didn’t know me really, yet i still let his opinion hurt me. i don’t think i’m a manipulative person. but now i’m second guessing who i am. i’m just so upset and need some words of encouragement.",x257h8,336,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/x257h8/hey_mom_a_boy_called_me_manipulative_and_i_cant/

My husband is with me, he can only offer so much support, he is also upset and beating himself up for it. His mother died a month ago, and he said one regret he had is not being able to give her grandchildren... I told him I was so so sorry. He didn't mean to blame me, but it felt like it..

I was terrified and this court date had been weighing on me for almost two months because regardless of covid, it had to be in person. He never showed up which would typically mean the case is rescheduled but instead, the judge let me plead my case without him there. The judge pointed out 19 different acts of domestic violence which are crimes just in the short time of my answering the court's questions. I was so ashamed of all of this. I was terrified waiting for him to walk in today and have to face him in person. I know my angels were looking out for me. I didn't have to face him and was granted the final restraining order.

#update as of 9/14 #

Apologies for formatting, I'm still learning Reddit. 

Thank you to everyone who commented. I spent the day yesterday reading and rereading through all these comments and I even sent this post to the trusted friend that I mentioned in the post and he told me that I needed to listen to all of you because you're all very very smart LOL.

I didn't mention this the other night because obviously my brain wasn't in its right state of mind, and it's still kind of isn't, but what makes part of this so incredibly traumatizing is that this couple have been close family friends of ours for over a decade. So I have spent the last year of my life trying to reconcile the fact that the man I thought he was, someone I would have trusted with my life, is not who he is and now on top of that, I have to come to terms with the fact that even I'm not safe from him. This is not the first time I've been assaulted and as I mentioned in the comment down below because of my first assault I am a virgin in my thirties and he has always known this because I've never hidden the fact that I was traumatized and now that I typed this out, I feel even worse but it's kind of a good thing because I know what I want to do and I'm going to take a stand. I need a few more days to shore up myself mentally and physically but I know what I'm going to do and I'm not going to let him get away with this anymore.

Thank you all so much for your comments and your help and your sympathy and your empathy and thank you for being here to help point me in the right direction. I'll keep coming back to this post and these comments when I feel shaky and I know that I'm doing the right thing even when it might not feel like it.

*Original Post*

Hey, Mom. I wanna start this by saying I do have two amazing parents who support me no matter what, but I just needed some other advice from moms or siblings ....

I think my boss assaulted me tonight. The following is copy and paste from what I told a trusted friend after I told my parents  .... 

""Kinda. I was stressed about a misogynist at the bar so I went out back and he rubbed my shoulders which was fine. Then, everyone left and he kept saying I was so tense and stressed and he started rubbing my ass cheeks and he had his hand on my abdomen for counter pressure and then all of a sudden, his hand was in my pants.

He asked me if I was uncomfortable but looking back, I realize I had disassociated when I said no to the question.

Mom and dad know and dad wants me to say something but I dont want to. Honestly, the idea of confronting it makes me more upset. I just wanna go on like nothing happened. I'm a sobbing mess right now at the idea of it. Maybe I'm a coward but I can't. I don't WANT to.

I don't want people to think I was complicit cause I said no in the moment.

I just want to get my school schedule for the fall and have an excuse to be done.""

Here is why I feel so conflicted... My other boss is this dude's wife and she's one of my mom's best friends. Last summer, an employee revealed she and the male boss had been having an affair for over two years. I'm TERRIFIED. I don't even gaf about the job. I'm TERRIFIED that if I say something or acknowledge it and she finds out, she'll feel like she can't trust me ... And after tonight, with me saying no when I should have said yes but was frozen in fear, I'm afraid I'll get blamed because that's what happened last summer. While both were guilty, she gets the blame from female boss and female boss has, apparently, forgiven her husband. 

I don't know what to do. Am I really a coward if I just act like nothing happened without letting myself be alone with him??? 

I'm so confused and torn and I can't stop crying. I feel like I can't catch my breath. This happened about 2 hours ago.",xcx9v0,312,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/xcx9v0/i_think_something_bad_happened_at_work_tonight/

893,"Update: Mum, I am terrified of giving birth and nobody is listening.","First, I wanted to thank everyone for their words of advice, reassurance, comfort and support. You got me through a very tough few days. 

I did eventually get a phone call on Friday, where we agreed that if I didn't labour naturally by my due date (May 11th) I could have the elective c-section I was asking for. The consultant was very apologetic for the lack of communication...and for once I didn't do my 'aww it's okay' routine. I told her it had been an horrendous time and had affected my mental health. 

ANYWAY, contractions started at 23:30 on Saturday 7th May. Our baby was born at 06:46 on Sunday 8th May. She was delivered via forceps and they had to cut me a tiny bit, but nothing overly dramatic and nothing anywhere near as traumatic as my son's arrival. She weighs 8.5lbs. 

There was some incompetence at the hospital (not surprising given the lack of comms in the week leading up to it) but I couldn't have wished for a better birth outcome - I am *so* in love with this baby. 

Her name is Arwen Elizabeth. I don't think I'm allowed to post photos but she has a mass of dark hair and the biggest eyes I've ever seen - and one of her ears is folded from the birth canal! Oh, it's so cute. SO cute. 

So thank you again, Mums. You're all fabulous. I hope you had a wholesome Mother's Day over in the US 🧡",ullkvv,310,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/ullkvv/update_mum_i_am_terrified_of_giving_birth_and/

I think the world is in a terrible place right now and it seems to only be getting worse, I don’t have the money, I don’t want my life to revolve around kids (which it kind of has to, to be a good parent), I don’t think I could mentally handle it… I just don’t want that life for myself. I love children, I really do, but I don’t think that I could handle having any of my own. I love my nieces and nephews, but don’t want the life that my sisters have. My husband is in total agreement, and will be getting the snips of his own. I’m so sure it’s the right thing for us, the right thing for *me.* It was something we’ve been talking about doing for years, but I looked into it seriously after Roe was overturned. The surgery is a week from Tuesday.


I can’t tell my mom IRL. She’ll try to talk me out of it, call me a selfish person, tell me I’m making a huge mistake, make it all about her and her religion. I want to tell my MIL, even though she might be disappointed, but I don’t want to tell her until after Thanksgiving because I don’t want it to be a topic of conversation at Thanksgiving dinner (yes, I know I’ll be sore and maybe out of it at dinner, but this is the only time I could get in this year, and we already met our deductible this year, so it just makes sense).

My grandmother asked me where it was at and I told her. She proceeded to tell me it was a stupid idea. She asked if I was going to just leave her and my grandfather which I tried to politely explain to her that there’s not to many opportunities around here where it’s a small town. She then proceeded to ask why I didn’t apply to one of the two factories we had here since they pay well, to which I explained that I had and didn’t hear anything back, plus this job pays more, is in my field of study, and has better benefits. 

She is convinced that it’s a stupid idea. She even said things like “you’re 24 don’t you have time to figure out what you want to do with your life?” and “we all can’t get what we want.” 

Through the whole thing I was trying to explain that I know what I want to do with my life hence why I’m going for a bachelor’s in psychology and now hopefully getting an amazing job at a mental hospital.

Hi Mom, I’ve never told you this, but I was r*ped by one of my “friends” my first semester at college. I’m starting my fourth semester next week, I’ve been in a lot of therapy, I have a different, much better friend group, and I used a tampon for the first time this evening. 

(I tried once in high school but it really hurt and you almost took me to the emergency room because it got “stuck on something” and I almost quit breathing trying to get it out. We mostly laugh about it now because I thought it was normal to walk like a duck while using one.) 

I’ve been wanting to try using them again for awhile; it sent me into a panic attack when I tried it this summer. But today I did it! I was really nervous and it took me three times to get it right but it didn’t hurt and didn’t send me into a flashback and I’m really proud of myself. 

I have a boyfriend who’s been super sweet about dealing with all my trauma and whatnot… he’s sleeping next to me and I’ll tell him when he wakes up but I needed to tell someone immediately. This is probably trivial but I think it’s a sign that I’m getting better and I’m really happy.

908,Hi mom. I’m finally finding myself after leaving the JW/WT cult.,"I’m not shunning you, but I had to let you go because *you* started shunning *me*. I didn’t leave you; I left the cult. 

Shunning me isn’t going to ever make me rejoin the cult. All it’s doing is robbing you of your son. Actually, it did that as soon as I reached puberty. 

I wish you would leave my father, or at least that you would break the cult rules and talk with me.

I miss your sense of humor and I wish you would break away and embrace your individuality. 

I remember when I was young, you still had your own personality and interests. You used to be a dancer. You used to have fun. I hate that your husband and the cult have taken that away from you. 

I never really got close to you because of what you stood for. Even when I internalized the doctrine, I still hated it.

I had to let you go because you started shunning me. The very minute you start questioning the cult, please call me. I can help you and you can come stay with me. 

I want us to be closer than was possible in that high-control religion. I know you feel that shunning me is “the right thing to do”. I wish you would reach out to me now.

913,I need advice from moms who have lost their child to suicide,"TW: suicide

My ex-husband took his own life 4 months ago. He was his parents’ only child. I can’t imagine the grief they must have.

My ex-husband left me about a year before he committed suicide. Said he wasn’t in love with me anymore; that he wasn’t happy. The last time I had spoken to him was when he picked up his things from our shared apartment.

Before we split up, my in-laws loved me. My MIL would have gifts for me every time I saw them. She would go all out for me for Christmas. I didn’t talk to them from when we split up (Christmas 2020) until my ex committed suicide. I went to the funeral. I sent them flowers. I haven’t spoken to them much since then. I didn’t know what role I had in their lives after the separation. And I don’t know what role I should have in their lives now. My ex and I didn’t have kids, so there are no familial ties they have to me. I live a few hours away from them as well, so it’s not like I can drop by and casually check on them.

I would like to send flowers for Mother’s Day. But I don’t know what to write in the card. Or maybe Mothers Day will be a painful reminder for my ex-MIL. I don’t know.

For those who have lost a child to suicide, what do you feel would be appropriate from an ex-DIL?

ETA: At this time I cannot speak well of my ex-husband. I loved him for a long time. But the way he handled the end of our relationship was really shitty. So I find it difficult to even remember fond memories with him, much less talk about them.

917,"Hey mom, should I 20F continue to date a guy who is 37 years old?","I don't know where else to post this. I've been lurking on this sub for a while and everyone here seems really nice. I'm kind of confused and I can really use some advice. I wish that I could talk to my actual mom about this but I can't.

I'm 20F and I recently went on a date with a guy 37M. I met him at the gym a couple months ago and he would help me out with some of my workouts. We exchanged phone numbers and we started talking regularly from there. At first I thought that maybe I should stop talking to him because he's so much older than me but I decided not to.

It turns out that we have some things in common. Like we listen to the same music, watch the same shows etc. Anyways he asked me out on a date a week ago and I decided to go because I kind of do feel attracted to him. The date was a bit awkward but overall it was fine. I think the awkwardness was mostly my fault. I was really nervous for some reason. I don't have much experience with dating and relationships. I've only been in one relationship in my entire life that only lasted 5 months.

After the date we were in his car. He kissed me and I kissed back. We continued to kiss for a bit but I stopped because I started to feel anxious again... I don't know why I kept getting anxious. He asked me if I wanted to go back to his place. I'm not stupid. I knew what he meant by that and I told him no. He looked pretty disappointed and surprised by my response. I explained to him that I've never done anything with a guy before and I wanted my first time to be with someone that I love and that I'm actually in a relationship with. He was understanding but he still seemed kind of disappointed. He took me home after that.

We didn’t talk much after the date. I saw him at the gym again yesterday. We talked for a bit and he asked me out on another date. I told him that I needed to think about it. A part of me wanted to go on the date with him but I got that anxious feeling again. Then he told me not to worry about the age gap if that's what I'm worried about. He said that age is just a number, that we have a lot in common, that he really likes me and that I seem pretty mature for my age.

I tried asking some of my friends for advice and I got mixed advice. Some of my friends think that I should continue to date him. They said that I should give him a chance. They told me to stop overthinking and start living. They said that I should date him and have fun with it. Then I could stop if things don't work out. My other friends think that it's a bad idea mainly because of the age gap. They think that this whole thing is creepy and that I shouldn't continue to see him. I got even more confused after talking to my friends about it. That's mainly the reason why I'm posting here. I could really use some advice. Is the age gap really a problem?

I didn't really do much, and I didn't even have to do it - I was supposed to be doing the dishes. But I cleared off the stove, chopped the onions, put oil in the pan and sauteed them for a few, put the spices together for the meat, then cooked up the meat with the spices, put the meat into the leftover pasta from last night. All on my own, because my brother holed himself up in the livingroom on his phone. 


 It was pretty hectic, kinda fun, now I definitely have a new understanding for people who have no help in the kitchen. And for those who aren't thanked for it, told it tasted good.....I don't know. I feel like I'm whining. That I should take that they nearly ate all of it as the compliment I'm looking for, but verbal appreciation means more to me.

Am I being ungrateful? 


It's just, its something I make sure and tell my mom every night at dinner, that its delicious and thank you for making it, because dad doesn't. 


I don't know....guess I was just hoping she'd tell me I did a good job. Something. This was just a big thing for me, I don't normally take charge like this because due to my memory resetting itself every so often, I don't usually *like* to take charge on my own.



(And it is *that* time of the month so all my emotions are taking a dive right now, and I'm not sure whether I'm overreacting or not.)

934,"Mom, I (27f) need to break up with my boyfriend (31m) and I’m terrified of the fallout.","Before I go into details, I just want to say how much a truly appreciate this sub. My mom isn’t capable of empathy so I miss out on a lot of help that I need. Thank you all for existing and helping the way you do. 

I’ve been in my relationship for a little over two years now. And it’s just not working. My boyfriend is a hobosexual, he was living at home and working as a landscaper. Things moved fast and he quickly moved in with me. I figured since he had a job we would be fine. 

To put it concisely, my income supplements our entire lives. Everything he has and uses is because of me and my job. He doesn’t get full time work, so he barely pulls in enough to feed his smoking and pop habit. 

I’m not a saint so I put up with these habits figuring I can support us both if he uses his money for our food and fun spending. This was such a mistake. I can’t even explain the shell of a person I have become because of this money issue. I can’t save, I can’t buy myself new clothes. I feel absolutely trapped. 

Mom, how can I break up with him that will help soften the blows. If I leave, he loses everything and moves back in with his parents. I still feel compassion and empathy towards him. But it feels clear to me that unless he gets a full time job with benefits then we are done. 

He’s honestly a big man child that doesn’t seem capable of bettering himself. Whenever he “fucks up” he mopes on the couch for a day and then goes back to what he always does. 

I know I should really rip the bandaid off but because we live together and so much of our lives are entangled it feels scary and risky. 

I’m trying to clearly communicate with him that things aren’t working before I break things off. 

I want to be with someone that is able to pay attention to me the same way I am to them. This boy didn’t even get me a Christmas or birthday present last year because “he didn’t have the money” but begged me to get him a Christmas present. 

I work in a high school. And he will yell and complain how I will talk to him like one of my kids. Maybe if he didn’t act like one then I wouldn’t have to. 

Any kind advice would help. I feel stuck.

938,I tried being more honest with my mum about how I feel and she wishes I never said anything. She liked me more when I was anorexic.,"I'm sorry I know this sounds stupid but I'm so sad and lonely and I don't know what to do, I don't even want to be here anymore.  
  
I'm 16 and until recently my parents thought I was the perfect kid. I have 2 brothers and they aren't ""bad"" at all but they have their own personalities and don't just automatically do what my parents want. I've always been quiet, calm, docile, never got mad, never got upset. I dont even know what my interests are because my only hobbies are things my parents chose and they're always a competition and if I don't ""win"" it's worthless.  
  
I use anorexia to keep myself numb so it's easier to ignore bad feelings. It's been going on for a really long time but quite recently I got really sick and had to spend months in hospital. One of the things I'm supposed to work on is opening up when I'm feeling bad instead of blocking it out and I'm really really trying but my parents don't want to hear it.  
  
My mum loves my brothers even though they're not ""perfect"", she's interested in them and cares about their personalities. I thought that might be the same for me but it isn't. She says she's disappointed and she misses how I used to be before I tried opening up. It seems like the only thing she liked about me was that I was obedient and didn't make a fuss, and if I don't have that then I don't have any value to her.  
   
I'm so sad and lost and confused. I just want her to care about me and think I'm good enough even if I'm not perfect. There are things that happened when I was really young that I never told anyone about and now I know I never can. I can't even tell my therapist because there's a chance she'll say she needs to report it and my parents will find out and I can't let that happen. Even the small things I've shared have been too much trouble.   
  
I'm sorry for complaining. I know I have better parents than most. I'm just so unhappy and I wish someone cared about me enough to want to understand how I feel.

hi mom, i can’t go to my own mother bc we don’t talk. i don’t really have anyone to talk to about this. i’m sorry if this isn’t allowed, i saw that nsfw topics aren’t allowed so mods, delete if this isn’t okay? 

basically, i think about two days ago i was sexually assaulted.. and sodomized. the time line is fuzzy because i was drinking but i also think i was drugged? i’m not sure, there’s gaps in my memory but i really didn’t think i drank that much? i don’t normally drink other than maybe a beer with my neighbour if we’re out cutting hay. i remember doing two shots of something called jolly rancher like the candy. and then i was carrying around a vodka cranberry bc my friend suggested i try it. i don’t remember finishing it though. i know i felt sick and wanted to leave, my friend didn’t want to so i booked an uber. i don’t remember getting in it though. (i don’t know how i got home.)
anyway, the next thing i remember is just.. searing pains like white hot.. back there. and the carpet was hurting my face. he said “if you want to act like a *f slur for gay men* you’ll get treated like one”
(i’m trans maculine nonbinary and he hates that.)
i’m scared because i know that you can get infections and stuff from switching what is being penetrated.. i don’t know what to do. i can’t tell anyone. i live in the country and don’t drive right now so i’d have to get a ride to a clinic. also this is gross.. but i also haven’t left my bed in i think two days. everything hurts. i don’t want to move. there’s some blood on my sheet.. there might be other stuff too like idk there could be feces or stuff from him. but he used like baby wipes on me? he said it was the polite thing to do and he is a gentleman. could that be enough to not make me sick? do i have to go to the doctor and tell them? i don’t want them to call the police. the police are not an option. 
bc the other thing is that the person is my friends soon to be step brother.  he’s older. i’m 22 and he is in his early 30s i think. 
so basically can those infections kill you? can i not go to the doctor?

She's had several brain surgeries and is now awake and talking, but gets confused easily.  For instance,  TV can influence her reality and she'll believe Dr. Strange has just been in for a visit.

She seems to remember I should have a baby by now.  She literally asks every day.  I'm not mad at her (not even a little... I'm just so thankful I even have 60% of her back to normal)...but, I won't lie... it hurts to talk about every day.

I was in a deep depressive episode, feeling unable to connect, when I came across the advice of unmasking (edit: emotionally not physically). 

I gave it a shot and I felt free. I was finally able to be myself and I was happy about it.

I don't really have anyone to talk to about this either. My friends and I have grown apart since high school and they barely talk to me anymore.

I'm so sick of feeling like I'm the problem, like I need to change who I am for other people to tolerate me, but people really don't like me after I started unmasking.

980,Hi mom. You got time for a stupid question?,"Before we begin, I'd like to thank you. This is such a wholesome idea for a sub and if you're here to be a mom for a minute, I'd be proud to know a person that cool for real. Thanks.

Anyway, look. Growing up my household wasn't great. Mom protected us very well from the worst of my step-father's insanity, but I was pretty much my sister's bodyguard from when I was about 8 years old.

At the age of 14 I stood up to our abuser, and just like that, I was never a child again.

The way mom treated me from that point on was as an adult. She never told me what to do. She asked my advice and valued my response. If she disapproved of something in my life, she'd state her reasons but ultimately let me make my decisions. We've been best friends ever since.

But I can't ask mom this. She'd think she did something wrong and she's a god damn superhero. I like the man in the mirror, and she's a large part of the reason for that, but I've always wanted to know...

What did I miss? I wanted to be a kid for just a little bit longer. Just a couple more years without feeling responsible for the safety of my mom and siblings. A couple more years of doing stupid shit and mostly evading consequences. A couple more years of being protected instead of protecting. 

Thanks for reading. Take care.

Anytime I have a boundary, I'm ""difficult or angry.""  My aunt told me that my mom told her that she is ""terrified"" of me. I haven't been able to get past this.

My brain gets it but it still really f'ing hurts. 

She hasn't tried to explain why she said that she's terrified of me. I have zero interest in spending time with her until she apologizes and even then it'll be minimal. I wonder how else she's been smearing me behind my back. (I have some idea that she has because of how people are treating me now.)

994,I just need someone to tell me my baby mattered.,"TW- Miscarriage 

Today is Pregnancy and Child Loss Awareness day. Four years ago today, I was sitting in the hospital waiting to have a d and c. I was supposed to be 11 weeks pregnant but the baby stopped growing. I was so angry. The minute I knew the baby was gone my life changed. I had been planning for this baby for years. I was going to have them just in time to put my oldest in school so I wouldn’t have to pay two daycares. I plan everything. I have never felt so numb and angry. What a lot of people don’t understand with a miscarriage is that not only did I lose my baby I also lost the life I envisioned. 

I was obsessed with getting pregnant again. Luckily, I was pregnant within three months of my loss. What was supposed to be a joyous pregnancy was anything but. I had the worst anxiety and depression in the world. I was so scared to lose this baby too. After I had her 15 days before the one year mark of my loss, I felt so guilty about that I was replacing my angel baby with this baby that I suffered horrible postpartum depression and anxiety. Then Covid happened 6 months later and again I lost control of my planning. I took COVID so seriously I turned my hands raw for months cleaning stuff.

I miss my angel baby. No one remembers them except me since I was able to get pregnant again so fast. Everyone knew about my baby. I keep a box next to my bed with my ultrasound, a pair of socks, and my pregnancy test. If I try to bring up my baby everyone reminds me that my youngest wouldn’t be here if that pregnancy hadn’t ended. I get that but why does anyone make me feel like a terrible person for mourning my angel baby. I can love them both. My mom is an amazing person but I can’t talk to her about this because all she talks about is Gods plan.

Was he scared when he died? Was he relieved? Did he want it to be over? Did he overdose deliberately? Did he know how much I love him and wouldn’t have done anything to save him? Did he know he could come to me, but didn’t want to?

I don’t even know if I will be able to get to the funeral. It’s going to cost thousands. I don’t have that kind of money on hand. And I don’t know how to face the rest of the family. A family I ran away from a decade ago after years of abuse. He was the only real family, the only one who had my back.

This doesn’t feel real. I keep hoping I’ll wake up and find out this was all a bad dream. Why can’t I wake up?",uq22xw,263,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/uq22xw/its_over_mom_they_found_his_body/
