0,My daughter passed away when she was 15. Today is her 21st birthday and I so miss being a mom to her. Anybody need a mom for a minute?,,shxdas,13138,828,https://i.redd.it/uieiwvhnn8f81.jpg

2,Hey Mom! So I’ve reached a pretty big milestone and have now been transitioning for over a year! I’m so proud at how far I’ve come and I hope you’re proud of your daughter. 💜,"My Mom passed away before I was able to come out to her and it’s something that will always haunt me forever. 

I never wanted anything more than to be Mom and Daughter together, cooking meals, getting our nails done, going shopping, etc and just coming to terms that I’ll never get that chance is difficult.",weu7zn,8962,531,https://i.redd.it/3ux0bpvgref91.jpg

10,MOMMMM!!! I’ve been in a womens shelter for three months and I had to leave so much behind to not set off any alarms. I’ve finally been able to afford a laundry hamper and full body mirror 💙 I’ve never been so grateful so razor refills and a clock. A water bottle! Kitchen towels! They’re so pretty!,"I’m literally dancing around my room opening this haul I’ve finally been able to afford after struggling for so long. It feels so bitter sweet. I have no one to celebrate this with who will understand why this is such a big amazing moment for me 💚💚💚💚

I’m so happy right now to have the basics I’ve been saving for months.

Truthfully there’s no one I can celebrate all these milestones with. I’ve come so since I escaped and I wish I could tell the whole world or have someone say omg I see you! You’re doing it! This is a big deal! Thank you for being that safe space for me moms 💚

Edit: I forgot the other stuff I got! I’m literally happy crying from gratitude! I got a steel 30oz tumblr for the summer. It’s so cute and classy. No more rationing plastic water bottles. I can’t stop staring at it. I’m dancing in front of my mirror with my tumblr like the happiest I’ve been in so long. My clock is so big!! No more racing around looking for a device wondering what time it is while getting ready (I have ADHD so clocks help so much). I got face towels, no more paper towels!! But i got some of those and toilet paper too! I was using one roll of paper towels for both. I got the *comfiest* flip flops that I don’t ever want to take off. I got that lysol spray that smells like lavender 💜 and dryer sheets and febreeze that I keep spraying on everything lol god it feels so good. Body lotion!! And it smells like summer!! And it’s from my favorite vegan brand. I still can’t get over having my trash in an actual trash can and my laundry in an actual hamper that won’t stink. And another small laundry basket to carry my laundry up that won’t take using all my strength to climb the stairs. Can you tell I went to target? Lol thanks for letting me share this, I’ve been dying to tell anyone

Edit 2: OMG A GOLD I LOVE THIS SUBREDDIT 🥺💓

Edit 3: I turned my phone off the night I posted this and woke up to all of this 💓 I’m so overwhelmed I can’t even put it into words. I’m sorry I couldn’t update sooner. My rabbit had a little scare this week and I’ve been high key stressed about getting him better and getting him to take some meds. He’s doing a little better now thankfully. I just didn’t have the social battery or energy to respond or update until now. 

I honestly didn’t think anyone would see this. Maybe one or two people but the out pouring of love I’ve received is one of the most touching moments I’ve experienced on Reddit. To be seen and celebrated with like this, it helps so much on the lonely harder days than you can imagine. 

I want to respond to each and everyone of you, but I might not get to it tonight. I’m so sorry to keep everyone waiting and sorry I couldn’t update sooner. I just want to put my full energy and focus into my replies

To everyone who offered me some help, I can’t tell you the feelings of gratitude and love I had when I saw your messages. The internet can be such a crazy mean place. But all of your messages restore my faith in humanity and give me so much hope for our world. Im overwhelmed and want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindnesses are so heart warming. It’s really kept me going this week. 

I’m going to get back to everyone as soon as I can. Thank you for being so patient and sweet to me. I don’t know if I can post or link my stuff here so I’ll message everyone who offered individually. 

Moms, siblings, friends, fam, i love you all so much. I wish all the blessings on you.

I honestly cannot wait to be in the position where I can scroll through this subreddit and offer kindness and help like you all have done for me 💛 I can’t wait to pay it forward and be a mom for a minute to more people like me who need support and love the most 

You’re all my favorite people in the internet

Edit 4: I’m so sorry, I have ASD and things slip from my mind so quickly. I wanted to say thank you so much for all the awards!!!! I literally dropped my phone when I woke up and saw all of them. Good lord I’ve never received so many golds, let alone awards! I’m going around giving everyone all the rewards I can now lol thank you so much for appreciating and celebrating my little wins and milestones. You’re all so kind, I wish the world was more like you",v7bcp1,4816,213,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/v7bcp1/mommmm_ive_been_in_a_womens_shelter_for_three/

18,I’m sure you’re all tired of my updates but I just need one more happy moment......they chose my middle name.......and the second they told me why I broke down.,"So I accepted my parents offer to legally adopt me. Part of that was I wanted to take their last name, but also due to the abuse from my biological parents I didn’t want to keep my middle name since since it was my biological mothers first name. 

I told my new parents I wanted them to choose a name for my middle name because they have 4 kids between them (3 living) but have none biologically together so they’ve never gotten to choose a name for a child together. I wanted to give them that opportunity as a couple/parents and also for me to have the sentimental value that they chose my new middle name specifically for me.  

So we’re headed to the lawyers soon to start paperwork and they wanted to come up with a name before we started the paperwork. Apparently they were awake half the night searching baby names and meanings on the Internet and discussing it trying to find one they loved. 

Well they found one. 

They chose “EMMELLYN” which means  “peaceful home” 

They told me their reasons for meaning and spelling were: 

1. With them and being adopted I now will legally forever have a peaceful home/family. No more abuse or trauma to worry about. 

2. Both of their middle names start with “E” so they only considered “E” names 

3. Moms middle name has “ELL” in it 

4. Dad’s first name has “ELL” in it 


As soon as they finished that explanation and I said my full name with this middle name and their last name out loud.........instant tears from me. 

I don’t know what I expected them to come up with for a name, but this has so much more meaning and deep ties to them/their names than I ever thought they could pack into one name. 

I finally know my new name.....it’ll take a while for the whole process and before it’s legal and all that, but I finally feel like I’m moving on from my past and building a future with my family.",v45sha,3995,361,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/v45sha/im_sure_youre_all_tired_of_my_updates_but_i_just/

24,My baby sister just spoke for the first time,"She’s 11. She’s my baby cousin technically but my parents have custody and they’re adopting her. 

She didn’t speak at all although I swear I heard her talking to her comfort toy, a stuffed elephant. 

She’s homeschooled and I’m taking online classes so I can take care of her during the day. She spends most of the day sitting next to me/in my lap while I work and we’ve gotten really close. 

She got sick on Monday. Her doctor said it’s just a stomach bug and she’ll be fine but I had to take her to the hospital today. I called my mom at work and she met us there. I picked my sister up and tried to hand her off to my mom and she held onto me and said “no”. That was huge for her. So my mom got her bag and I carried her in and she mumbled “Ellie” (her elephant is named Ellie). 

This is huge for her. This is the first time she’s ever spoken to any of us.

Update: I’m with my sister at the hospital and she’s looking so much better. She also has the energy to play with her toys for the first time since Monday.",waippe,3820,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/waippe/my_baby_sister_just_spoke_for_the_first_time/

29,I really like my foster home so far,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this post but I don’t know where else to put this. 

I’ve been in my foster home for 4 months now and it’s really nice. I have my own room with a really comfy bed and my foster parents let me paint it whatever color I wanted. They even took me shopping for decorations. They have 4 other kids, all girls. We don’t always get along but they’re usually pretty nice, especially the oldest two. They also have a lot of animals. Their house is on a farm. They have 2 horses, 24 chickens, 7 ducks, 2 dogs, and 3 cats. I’m scared of cats but they’re not that bad and I can usually stay away from them. This family takes me on vacations with them. They travel a lot. And there’s always really good food in the house and I can eat whenever I want. My foster mom is the best cook. They let me do school online because I get really scared around a lot of people and I have a really hard time talking in front of people and I’m doing really good. I had a test today and I got a B. My birthday was on Wednesday and they got me presents. I don’t usually get presents on my birthday so I was kinda confused at first but opening the presents was really fun. 

Im really sorry if the post is too long. I’ve never done this before.

37,If you ever need a trip to Canada for poutine…,"In Canada, you can get a poutine in every province, if you so choose. Not everyone wants to order poutine, and that’s totally fine. It’s your choice. 

In the US, some states have restaurants with poutine on the menu. Lots don’t. And after today, fewer will. 

If you find yourself in need of a poutine, but live in a state that restricts access to poutine, consider a trip to Canada, and give me a shout. I won’t ask what size poutine you want or why you haven’t considered other food options. That’s your choice. That is ONLY YOUR CHOICE. I can, however, help take you to order your poutine, wait with you while you eat, and make sure you have a comfy place to rest, post-poutine.

I got you and I love you. -Mom

52,hi Mom's. it's me again. I got a 65% salary increase and I cannot tell my family,"Hi Mom's, dad's, brothers and sisters.

If my post history is of any interest,  I come from a toxic,  narcissistic and dysfunctional family.

I've always been the by the way child, albeit first born, yet my brother is the golden child. Culturally,  boys and men are better.

I've always been ambitious, studious and hard working. My brother has always been our mother's pet and anything I ever did was always over shadowed.

I began my current position last year. I am a late in life student, I finished my law degree when I was 36. Am currently doing masters.

Due to rising costs, as well as high performance,  my salary was increased by 50% after tax as of Friday. Indefinitely. I am so grateful for finally earning my worth (I am a non practicing legal practitioner in the financial services industry).

When I began my current role, I only told my parents a portion of what I earned. When I earned a bonus of 2 salaries on top of my salary in April, I just did a grocery run.

With the unexpected bonus (I was working less than a year), I settled all my debt. Including university. I am not in the USA,  so our tertiary fees are not that high.

I have been living debt free since April.

Right now, I've been afforded financial freedom,  through my hard work and persistence. I am grateful for who I have become, irrespective that no one in my immediate family has ever believed in my capabilities.

Thank you Internet family for listening.

Have a blessed week ahead.",wu7dr2,2967,283,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/wu7dr2/hi_moms_its_me_again_i_got_a_65_salary_increase/

59,"I've been clean from heroin for over 10 years, I bumped into an old ""friend"" who tried to convince me to use with him but I still said no.","I'm trying really hard to feel proud. I guess you could say I'm fishing a bit, for validation or something. 

I'm 33 now, I started using heroin when I was about 12 - not by choice at the time and I literally didn't even know what it was, then after a while it *was* by choice. I was in a really bad situation. Now I've been clean since my early 20s and I'm building a life I'm really happy with. 

I very recently bumped into someone I knew back then, we reconnected and he said he was also in recovery. Then we arranged to hang out and he showed up in an absolute state - I walked away and woke up to a load of texts and voicemails trying to get me to go score with him. 

Obviously I didn't do it and I was 100% open and honest with my partner about everything that happened. I blocked him. I'm still clean. I wish I felt proud of it though because tbh I just feel shame for being a junkie in the first place. 

I don't have a mum, dad or sibling. My partner says he's proud but he's also upset and I'm kinda spiralling even though he's being *so* supportive, I feel undeserving I guess. Some support from anonymous parent-figures would be lovely if that's ok.

61,Update Post: I took the leap of faith and accepted their offer to adopt me.,"Update: they’ve chosen my middle name. I made a new post with all the information there. 

So yesterday I posted that my chosen parents had let me know they had a desire to legally adopt me.

I’ve spent the last 24 hours on a roller coaster of emotions, and Reddit helped and hindered that experience for me. Some of you were a huge help and support and some others made me feel I had no choice but to decline. 

Tonight I asked my chosen parents the backstory and if their kids knew, if their kids were accepting of it etc. 

Apparently they reached out to a lawyer on March 1st to see if we met the criteria for adult adoption and once they found out that we would meet the criteria they got more information from their lawyer about the process to make it happen, and decided they wanted to suggest that offer to me.

Then at the beginning of April they told their kids that they wanted to legally adopt me and asked for all of their true opinions on it. Apparently that went over completely fine and everyone agreed it was a good choice because it would protect me if I have got hurt or sick and needed someone to act on my behalf, plus their kids thought maybe it would help me feel more apart of the family. They even showed me the group text messages their kids sent last night and sent this morning asking if I had told them yes or no yet because they’ve been waiting to find out my decision. 

Around 6:45 tonight I sat them down, asked for the backstory and then once I had my questions answered I told them I wanted them to adopt me. I even called them Mom and Dad for the first time (I’ve only ever used their first names). 

Mom broke down immediately and hugged me for a while as she cried. Dad held it together emotionally until I told him I wanted to have his last name. I also told them I didn’t want to keep my bio mother’s name as my middle name. I told them I wanted them to come up with a couple names that they like that I could choose from. I told them since they never had a biological child together (all their kids are from their first marriages) they never got to name a child together so I wanted them to get to have a say in my new middle name, plus for me that will carry sentimental value. Dad said he was never going to tell me he wanted me to take his last name because he wanted it to be 100% my choice but that it means the world that I want his name. 

So I’m spending the night here again tonight because the emotions are running high and I want to be near them for one more night......... but I’M GETTING ADOPTED!!!!",v3lwwp,2807,337,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/v3lwwp/update_post_i_took_the_leap_of_faith_and_accepted/

85,Update on my last post on whether I should break up with my boyfriend because he kicked me out of his car and left me on the side of the road. I broke up with him.,"I made a post a couple days ago on whether or not I should break up with my boyfriend after we had an argument and he kicked me out of the car and left me on the side of the road alone at 11 p.m. I thought that I was overreacting by wanting to break up with him but after reading all the comments on my previous post I realized that I was not. Those comments also mentioned some other red flags just from reading my post that I didn't notice before. I did a lot of reflecting on our relationship after I made that post and read all the comments. I started realizing a lot of things that were wrong with our relationship. I realized that there were lot more red flags. 

I decided to break up with him and I broke up with him yesterday. I was going to do it in person but some of the people in the comments told me not to as it might not be safe. I sent him a long text explaining everything instead. He called me right after he read the message. I answered and he started yelling at me. There was a lot yelling then crying then yelling then crying again. 

He apologized a lot and he told me that he would change. He genuinely sounded like he was sorry for everything and was ready to change. He promised to never hurt me again. At one point I felt guilty for breaking up with him. But I remembered that some of the comments on my last post told me that he would apologize and tell me that he would change then do the same thing again and that it could get worse. 

It was a long conversation and by the end of it he just accepted it. He asked me what he could do and I told him that he should get help and learn to control his anger so that he won't treat his next girlfriend like this. Then I cried for the rest of the night. I know that what he did was wrong and he didn't treat me well but I'm still sad about it. Some of you that commented on my last post were concerned for my safety but I'm okay and I think I'll be fine. 

Thank you to everyone that commented on my last post. Thank you for the advice and support. And thank you to those of you that shared your experiences. Sadly a lot of people has experienced something similar to this. I made that post because I don't have a mom that I can talk to. I have a mom but we're not close and I can't talk to her about these things. I'm glad that I made that post. Growing up my parents would fight a lot. My dad did a lot worse than what my boyfriend did but my mom still stayed with him because she loves him. That's why I thought that I was overreacting but I know now that I'm not.",t3fndo,2391,184,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/t3fndo/update_on_my_last_post_on_whether_i_should_break/
86,"Ok kiddos, we need to have a birds and bees chat. Everything you should have been told about menstruation but weren’t.","This is not to shame anyone for not knowing what they don’t know.  Knowledge is power and some people don’t care about you having power over your body.  

You can ask as many questions as you like.  There are no stupid questions and I have a looong attention span for answering.

A full menstrual cycle for a person in their fertile adult years lasts an average of 28 days.  That does not mean that YOUR cycle will last 28 days.  Just like you might not be of average height or have average intelligence or average body temperature, there are a lot of variables.  Furthermore, the length of your cycle is going to change over time.

The parts of a menstrual cycle are: (1) menstrual phase (your period), (2) follicular phase (your body getting ready to release an egg), (3) ovulation (your body has released an egg), and (4) luteal phase.

Let’s talk about these parts in more detail.

(1) menstruation.  Day 1 of your menstrual cycle is the first day of your period.  Spotting is not your period, periods can be light but they’re more than spotting.  Periods can last anywhere from just a few days to a week.  If your period lasts longer than a week, mention it to your gynecologist.  It can be nothing or it can be something problematic.  It may also lead to anemia (low iron).

(2) follicular phase.  Your estrogen levels are starting to climb which triggers your ovary to get ready to release an egg and your uterus gets ready to host an embryo. 

The increase in estrogen is also causing you to produce cervical mucous.  When you urinate in the morning, wipe your vulva (front to back) and make sure you swipe inside the outer labia.  Don’t wipe your vulva dry (you’ll irritate it), this is just a gentle swipe.  Take note of what you see.  

If the tissue is just damp with urine, you aren’t producing cervical mucous yet. If it’s the consistency of lotion, estrogen is building but you’re not yet fertile.  When it looks like egg whites (or snot), that means you’re fertile.

Most people produce eggwhite cervical mucous for 3-5 days leading up to ovulation.  If you consistently have only 1-2 days, mention it to your gynecologist.  You could have low estrogen levels or you might just be dehydrated.

Sperm can live for 5-7 days inside your body IF you have eggwhite cervical mucous for them to live in.   This means you can get pregnant from sex you had several days earlier.

(3) ovulation.  The day your ovary releases an egg is ovulation.  Most people’s bodies alternate between the right and left ovary.  Some people feel a sharp pain when their ovary release an egg, kind of like a running stitch.  That’s normal, don’t worry.

Once released, the egg can only survive for 24 hours.  Once that 24 hours ends, your estrogen levels drop, progesterone spikes, your cervix closes and becomes firm, and your cervical mucus gets thick and sticky.  If the egg is fertilized, it’s now in a closed environment.  If it’s not, it dies.

Your body can’t tell yet whether or not your egg is fertilized.

(4) Luteal phase.  This is the phase of your cycle that is the most consistent in length.  Your body might delay ovulation, but once that egg is released, you cant put the genie back in the bottle.

Your temperature will be slightly higher during your luteal phase and progesterone is the dominant hormone.  Approximately 7 days into the luteal phase, a fertilized egg will implant.  Only then can your body start to realize you’re pregnant.  This is why early pregnancy tests can be a false negative.

A luteal phase shorter than 10 days indicates low progesterone and May make it difficult to stay pregnant (low progesterone cannot be relied on as birth control). 

If you have any questions,ask away

Moms- I know this is an odd question, but I have no one else to ask. Almost 10 years ago, my daughter died unexpectedly. I was reeling and bought 2 very expensive dresses for the wake and funeral. She was so fashionable and I didn’t want to embarrass her, so I bought 2 classic and beautiful dresses that have sat in my closet ever since. 
My nephew is getting married tomorrow and I tried on one of the dresses and it’s completely appropriate. Can I wear it? I don’t think it’s disrespectful to her memory, but I’d like some input, if you don’t mind. I doubt anyone will remember. But what if they do? 
I do have a plan b dress.


ETA - Thank you, Moms, for your input. I’m probably going to wear the dress tomorrow with some accessories and a shrug. We’ll see how it feels in the morning.
